{"id":93669,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"August 12, 1977\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n Finding you wasn\u0027t much of a trick - I sometimes think if you have enough free cash, you can find anyone in this country, and the cash I got. Maybe I\u0027m risking your resentment stating it as baldly as that, but Chuck and Shelley and I owe you too much to tell you less than the truth. Money buys a lot, but it can\u0027t buy off the lightning. They found twelve boys still in the men\u0027s room opening off the restaurant, the one where the window had been nailed shut. The fire didn\u0027t reach there but the smoke did, and all twelve of them were suffocated. I haven\u0027t been able to get that out of my mind, because Chuck could have been one of those boys. So I had you \u0027tracked down\u0027, as you put it in your letter. And for the same reason, I can\u0027t leave you alone as you requested. At least not until the enclosed check comes back canceled with your endorsement on the back.\\n\\n You\u0027ll notice that it\u0027s a considerably smaller check than the one you returned about a month ago. I got in touch with the EMMC Accounts Department and paid your outstanding hospital bills with the balance of it. You\u0027re free and clear that way, Johnny. That I could do, and I did it - with great pleasure, I might add.\\n\\n You protest you can\u0027t take the money. I say you can and you will You will, Johnny. I traced you to Ft. Lauderdale, and if you leave there I will trace you to the next place you go, even if you decide on Nepal. Call me a louse who won\u0027t let go if you want to; I see myself more as \u0027the Hound of Heaven\u0027. I don\u0027t want to hound you, Johnny. I remember you telling me that day not to sacrifice my son. I almost did. And what about the others? Eighty-one dead, thirty more terribly maimed and burned. I think of Chuck saying maybe we could work out some kind of a story, spin a yarn or something, and me saying with all the righteousness of the totally stupid, \u0027I won\u0027t do that, Chuck. Don\u0027t ask me.\" Well, I could have done something. That\u0027s what haunts me. I could have given that butcher Carrick ~3,ooo to pay off his help and shut down for the night. It would have come to about ~37 a life. So believe me when I say I don\u0027t want to hound you; I\u0027m really too busy hounding myself to want to spare the time. I think I\u0027ll be doing it for quite a few years to come. I\u0027m paying up for refusing to believe anything I couldn\u0027t touch with one of my five senses. And please don\u0027t believe that paying the bills and tendering this check is just a sop to my conscience. Money can\u0027t buy off the lightning, and it can\u0027t buy an end to bad dreams, either. The money is for Chuck, although he knows nothing about it.\\n\\n Take the check and I\u0027ll leave you in peace. That\u0027s the deal. Send it on to UNICEF, if you want, or give it to a home for orphan bloodhounds, or blow it all on the ponies. I don\u0027t care. Just take it.\\n\\n I\u0027m sorry you felt you had to leave in such a hurry, but I believe I understand. We all hope to see you soon. Chuck leaves for Stovington Prep on September 4.\\n\\n Johnny, take the check. Please.\\n\\n All regards,\\n\\n Roger Chatsworth\\n\\n September 1 1977\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n Will you believe that I\u0027m not going to let this go? Please. Take the check.\\n\\n Regards,\\n\\n Roger\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n September 10, 1977\\n\\n Charlie and l were both so glad to know where you are, and it was a relief to get a letter from you that sounded so natural and like yourself. But there was one thing that bothered me very much, son. I called up Sam Weizak and read him that part of your letter about the increasing frequency of your headaches. He advises you to see a doctor, Johnny, without delay. He is afraid that a clot may have formed around the old scar tissue. So that worries me, and it worries Sam, too. You\u0027ve never looked really healthy since you came out of the coma, Johnny, and when I last saw you in early June, I thought you looked very tired. Sam didn\u0027t say, but I know what he\u0027d really like you to do is to catch a plane out of Phoenix and come on home and let him be the one to look at you. You certainly can\u0027t plead poverty now!\\n\\n Roger Chatsworth has called here twice, and I tell him what I can. I think he\u0027s telling the truth when he says it isn\u0027t conscience-money or a reward for saving his son\u0027s life. I believe your mother would have said that the man is doing penance the only way he knows how. Anyway, you\u0027ve taken it, and I hope you don\u0027t mean it when you say you only did it to \u0027get him off your back\u0027. I believe you have too much grit in you to do anything for a reason like that.\\n\\n Now this is very hard for me to say, but l will do the best I can. Please come home, Johnny. The publicity has died down again I can hear you saying, \u0027Oh bullshit, it will never die down again, not after this\u0027 and I suppose you are right in a way, but you are also wrong. Over the phone Mr. Chatsworth said, \u0027If you talk to him, try to make him understand that no psychic except Nostradamus has ever been much more than a nine-days\u0027 wonder.\u0027 I worry about you a lot, son. I worry about you blaming yourself for the dead instead of blessing your. self for the living, the ones you saved, the ones that were at the Chatsworths\u0027 house that night. I worry and I miss you, too. \u0027I miss you like the dickens,\u0027 as your grand-mother used to say. So please come home as soon as you can.\\n\\n Dad\\n\\n P.S. I\u0027m sending the clippings about the fire and about your part in it. Charlie collected them up. As you will see, you were correct in guessing that \u0027everyone who was at that lawn party will spill their guts to the papers\u0027. I suppose these clippings may just upset you more, and if they do, just toss them away. But Charlie\u0027s idea was that you may look at them and say, \u0027That wasn\u0027t as bad as I thought, I can face that.\u0027 I hope it turns out that way.\\n\\n Dad\\n\\n September 29, 1977\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n I got your address from my dad. How is the great American desert. Seen any redskins (ha-ha)? Well here I am at Stovington Prep. This place isn\u0027t so tough. I am taking sixteen hours of credit. Advanced chemistry is my favorite although it\u0027s really something of a tit after the course at DHS. I always had the feeling that our teacher there, old Fearless Farnham, would really have been more happy making doomsday weapons and blowing up the world. In English we are reading three things by J. D. Salinger this first four weeks, Catcher in the Rye, Franny and Zooey, and Raise High the Roof Beams, Carpenters. I like him a lot. Our teacher told us he still lives over in N.H. but has given up writing. That blows my mind. Why would someone just give up when they are going great guns? Oh well. The football team here really sucks but I\u0027m learning to like soccer. The coach says soccer is football for smart people and football is football for ass-holes. I can\u0027t figure out yet if he\u0027s right or just jealous.\\n\\n I\u0027m wondering if it would be oh to give out your address to some people who were at our party graduation night. They want to write and say thanks. One of them is Patty Strachan\u0027s mother, you will remember her, the one that made such a pisshead of herself when her \u0027precious daughter\u0027 fainted at the lawn party that afternoon. She now figures that you\u0027re an ok person. I\u0027m not going with Patty anymore, by the way. I\u0027m not much on long-distance courtships at my \u0027tender age\u0027 (ha-ha), and Patty is going to Vassar, as you might have expected. I\u0027ve met a foxy little chick here.\\n\\n Well, write when you can, my man. My dad made it sound like you were really \u0027bummed out\u0027 for what reason I do not know since it seems to me that you did everything you could to make things turn out right. He\u0027s wrong, isn\u0027t he, Johnny? You\u0027re really not that bummed out, are you? Please write and tell me you are oh, I worry about you. That\u0027s a laugh, isn\u0027t it, the original Alfred E. Neuman worried about you, but I am.\\n\\n When you write, tell me why Holden Caulfield always has to have the blues so much when he isn\u0027t even black.\\n\\n Chuck\\n\\n P.S. The foxy chick\u0027s name is Stephanie Wyman, and have already turned her on to Something Wicked This Way Comes. She also likes a punk-rock group called The Ramones, you should hear them, they are hilarious.\\n\\n C\\n\\n October 17, 1977\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n Okay, that\u0027s better, you sound ok. Laughed my ass off about your job with the Phoenix Public Works Dept. I have no sympathy at all for your sunburn after four outings as a Stovington Tiger. Coach is right, l guess, football is football for assholes, at least at this place. Our record is 1-3 and in the game we won I scored three touchdowns, hyperventilated my stupid self and blacked out. Scared Steff into a tizzy (ha-ha).\\n\\n f waited to write so I could answer your question about how the Home Folks feel about Greg Stillson now that he is \u0027on the job\u0027. J was home this last weekend, and I\u0027ll tell you all I can. Asked my dad first and he said, \u0027Is Johnny still interested in that guy?\u0027 I said, \u0027He\u0027s showing his fundamental bad taste by wanting your opinion.\u0027 Then he goes to my mother, \u0027See, prep school is turning him into a smartass. I thought it would.\u0027\\n\\n Well, to make a long story short - most people are pretty surprised by how well Stillson\u0027s doing. My dad said this: \u0027If people of a congressman\u0027s home district had to give a report card on how well the guy was doing after four months, Stillson would get mostly Bs, plus an A for his work on Carter\u0027s energy bill and his own home heating-oil ceiling bill. Also an A for effort.\u0027 Dad told me to tell you that maybe he was wrong about Stillson being the village fool.\\n\\n Other comments from people I talked to when I was home: they like it around here that he doesn\u0027t dress up in a business suit. Mrs. Jarvis who runs the Quik-Pik (sorry about the spelling, man, but that\u0027s what they call it) says she thinks Stillson is not afraid of \u0027the big interests\u0027. Henry Burke, who runs The Bucket - that el scuzzo tavern downtown - says he thinks Stilison has done \u0027a double-damn good lob\u0027. Most other comments are similar. They contrast what Stillson has done with what Carter hasn\u0027t done, most of them are really disappointed in him and are kicking themselves for having voted for him. I asked some of them if they weren\u0027t worried that those iron horsemen were still hanging around and that fellow Sonny Elliman was serving as one of Stillson\u0027s aides. None of them seemed too upset. The guy who runs the Record Rock put it to be this way: \u0027If Tom Hayden can go straight and Eldridge Cleave can get Jesus, why can\u0027t some bikies join the establishment? Forgive and forget.\u0027\\n\\n So there you are. I would write more, but football practice is coming up. This weekend we are scheduled to be trounced by the Barre Wildcats. I just hope I survive the season. Keep well, my man.\\n\\n Chuck\\n\\n From the New York Times, March 4, 1978:\\n\\n FBI AGENT MURDERED IN OKLAHOMA\\n\\n Special to the Times - Edgar Lancte, 37, a ten-year veteran of the FBI, was apparently murdered last night in an Oklahoma City parking garage. Police say that a dynamite bomb wired to the ignition of his car exploded when Mr. Lancte turned the key. The gang-land-style execution was similar in style to the murder of Arizona investigative reporter Don Bolles two years ago, but FBI chief William Webster would not speculate on any possible connection. Mr. Webster would also neither confirm nor deny that Mr. Lancte had been investigating shady land deals and possible links to local politicians.\\n\\n There appears to be some mystery surrounding exactly what Mr. Lancte\u0027s current assignment was, and one source in the Justice Department claims that Mr. Lancte was not investigating possible land fraud at all but a national security matter.\\n\\n Mr. Lancte joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1968 and... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-25.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
