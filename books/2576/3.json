{"id":93647,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"1.\n It was nearly midnight when Johnny turned the wagon into her driveway. Sarah was dozing.\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 he said, cutting the motor and shaking her gently. \u0027We\u0027re here.\u0027\n \u0027Oh ... okay.\u0027 She sat up and drew her coat more tightly about her.\n \u0027How do you feel?\u0027\n \u0027Better. My stomach\u0027s sore and my back hurts, but better. Johnny, you take the car back to Cleaves with you.\n \u0027No, I better not,\u0027 he said. \u0027Someone would see it parked in front of the apartment house all night. That kind of talk we don\u0027t need.\u0027\n \u0027But I was going to come back with you...\n Johnny smiled. \u0027And that would have made it worth the risk, even if we had to walk three blocks. Besides, I want you to have the car in case you change your mind about the emergency room.\u0027\n \u0027I won\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027You might. Can I come in and call a cab?\u0027\n \u0027You sure can.\n They went in and Sarah turned on the lights before being attacked by a fresh bout of the shivers.\n \u0027The phone\u0027s in the living room. I\u0027m going to lie down and cover up with a quilt.\u0027\n The living room was small and functional, saved from a barracks flavor only by the splashy curtains - flowers in a psychedelic pattern and color - and a series of posters along one wall: Dylan at Forest Hills, Baez at Carnegie Hall, Jefferson Airplane at Berkeley, the Byrds in Cleveland.\n Sarah lay down on the couch and pulled a quilt up to her chin. Johnny looked at her with real concern. Her face was paper-white except for the dark circles under her eyes. She looked about as sick as a person can get.\n \u0027Maybe I ought to spend the night here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just in case something happens, like...\u0027\n \u0027Like a hairline fracture at the top of my spine?\u0027 She looked at him with rueful humor.\n \u0027Well, you know. Whatever.\u0027\n The ominous rumbling in her nether regions decided her. She had fully intended to finish this night by sleeping with John Smith. It wasn\u0027t going to work out that way. But that didn\u0027t mean she had to end the evening with him in attendance while she threw up, dashed for the w.c., and chugged most of a bottle of Pepto-Bismol.\n \u0027I\u0027ll be okay,\u0027 she said. \u0027It was just a bad carnival hot dog, Johnny. You could have just as easily gotten it yourself. Give me a call during your free period tomorrow.\n \u0027You sure?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I am.\u0027\n \u0027Okay, kid.\u0027 He picked up the phone with no further argument and called his cab. She closed her eyes, lulled and comforted by the sound of his voice. One of the things she liked most about him was that he would always really try to do the right thing, the best thing, with no self-serving bullshit. That was good. She was too tired and feeling too low to play little social games.\n \u0027The deed\u0027s done,\u0027 he said, hanging up. \u0027They\u0027ll have a guy over in five minutes.\u0027\n \u0027At least you\u0027ve got cab fare,\u0027 she said, smiling.\n \u0027And I plan to tip handsomely,\u0027 he replied, doing a passable W. C. Fields.\n He came over to the couch, sat beside her, held her hand.\n \u0027Johnny, how did you do it?\u0027\n \u0027Hmmm?\u0027\n \u0027The Wheel. How could you do that?\u0027\n \u0027It was a streak, that\u0027s all,\u0027 he said, looking a little uncomfortable. \u0027Everybody has a streak once in a while. Like at the race track or playing blackjack or just matching dimes.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Huh?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t think everybody does have a streak once in a while. It was almost uncanny. It ... scared me a little.\u0027\n \u0027Did it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n Johnny sighed. \u0027Once in a while I get feelings, that\u0027s all. For as long as I can remember, since I was just a little kid. And I\u0027ve always been good at finding things people have lost. Like that little Lisa Schumann at school. You know the girl I mean?\u0027\n \u0027Little, sad, mousy Lisa?\u0027 She smiled. \u0027I know her. She\u0027s wandering in clouds of perplexity through my business grammar course.\n \u0027She lost her class ring,\u0027 Johnny said, \u0027and came to me in tears about it. I asked her if she\u0027d checked the back corners of the top shelf in her locker. Just a guess. But it was there.\u0027\n \u0027And you\u0027ve always been able to do that?\u0027\n He laughed and shook his head. \u0027Hardly ever.\u0027 The smile slipped a little. \u0027But it was strong tonight, Sarah. I had that Wheel ...\u0027 He closed his fists softly and looked at them, now frowning. \u0027I had it right here. And it had the strangest goddam associations for me.\u0027\n \u0027Like what?\u0027\n \u0027Rubber,\u0027 he said slowly. \u0027Burning rubber. And cold. And ice. Black ice. Those things were in the back of my mind. God knows why. And a bad feeling. Like to beware.\u0027\n She looked at him closely, saying nothing, and his face slowly cleared.\n \u0027But it\u0027s gone now, whatever it was. Nothing probably.\u0027\n \u0027It was five hundred dollars worth of good luck, anyway,\u0027 she said. Johnny laughed and nodded. He didn\u0027t talk anymore and she drowsed, glad to have him there. She came back to wakefulness when headlights from outside splashed across the wall. His cab.\n \u0027I\u0027ll call,\u0027 he said, and kissed her face gently. \u0027You sure you don\u0027t want me to hang around?\u0027\n Suddenly she did, but she shook her head \u0027Call me,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Period three,\u0027 he promised. He went to the door.\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027\n He turned back.\n \u0027I love you, Johnny,\u0027 she said, and his face lit up like a lamp.\n He blew a kiss. \u0027Feel better,\u0027 he said, \u0027and we\u0027ll talk.\u0027\n She nodded, but it was four-and-a-half years before she talked to Johnny Smith again.\n 2.\n \u0027Do you mind if I sit up front?\u0027 Johnny asked the cab driver.\n \u0027Nope. Just don\u0027t bump your knee on the meter. It\u0027s delicate.\u0027\n Johnny slid his long legs under the meter with some effort and slammed the door. The cabbie, a middle-aged man with a bald head and a paunch, dropped his flag and the cab cruised up Flagg Street.\n \u0027Where to?\u0027\n \u0027Cleaves Mills,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Main Street. I\u0027ll show you where.\u0027\n \u0027I got to ask you for fare-and-a-half,\u0027 the cabbie said. \u0027I don\u0027t like to, but I got to come back empty from there.\u0027\n Johnny\u0027s hand closed absently over the lump of bills in his pants pocket. He tried to remember if he had ever had so much money on him at one time before. Once. He had bought a two-year-old Chevy for twelve hundred dollars. On a whim, he had asked for cash at the savings bank, just to see what all that cash looked like. It hadn\u0027t been all that wonderful, but the surprise on the car dealer\u0027s face when Johnny pumped twelve one hundred dollar bills into his hand had been wonderful to behold. But this lump of money didn\u0027t make him feel good at all, just vaguely uncomfortable, and his mother\u0027s axiom recurred to him: Found money brings bad luck.\n \u0027Fare-and-a-half\u0027s okay,\u0027 he told the cabbie.\n \u0027Just as long\u0027s we understand each other,\u0027 the cabbie said more expansively. \u0027I got over so quick on account of I had a call at the Riverside and nobody there would own up when I got over there.\u0027\n \u0027That so?\u0027 Johnny asked without much interest. Dark houses flashed by outside. He had won five hundred dollars, and nothing remotely like it had ever happened to him before. That phantom smell of rubber burning ... the sense of partially reliving something that had happened to him when he was very small ... and that feeling of bad luck coming to balance off the good was still with him.\n \u0027Yeah, these drunks call and then they change their minds,\u0027 the cabbie said. \u0027Damn drunks, I hate em. They call and decide what the hell, they\u0027ll have a few more beers. Or they drink up the fare while they\u0027re waitin and when I come in and yell \"Who wants the cab?\" they don\u0027t want to own up.\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Johnny said. On their left the Penobscot River flowed by, dark and oily. Then Sarah getting sick and saying she loved him on top of everything else. Probably just caught her in a weak moment, but God! If she had meant it I He had been gone on her almost since the first date.\n That was the luck of the evening, not beating that Wheel. But it was the Wheel his mind kept coming back to, worrying at it. In the dark he could still see it revolving, and in his ears he could hear the slowing ticka-ticka-ticka of the marker bumping over the pins like something heard in an uneasy dream. Found money brings bad luck.\n The cabbie turned off onto Route 6, now well-launched into his own monologue.\n \u0027So I says, \"Blow it outcha you-know-where.\" I mean, the kid is a smart-aleck, right? I don\u0027t have to take a load of horseshit like that from anyone, including my own boy. I been drivin this cab twenty-six years. I been held up six times. I been in fender-benders without number, although I never had a major crash, for which I thank Mary Mother of Jesus and Saint Christopher and God the Father Almighty, know what I mean? And every week, no matter how thin that week was, I put five bucks away for his college. Ever since he was nothin but a pip squeak suckin a bottle. And what for? So he can come home one fine day and tell me the president of the United States is a pig. Hot damn! The kid probably thinks I\u0027m a pig, although he knows if he ever said it I\u0027d rearrange his teeth for him. So that\u0027s today\u0027s young generation for you. So I says, \"Blow it outcha-you-know. where.\"\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Johnny said. Now woods were floating by. Carson\u0027s Bog was on the left. They were seven miles from Cleaves Mills, give or take. The meter kicked over another dime.\n One thin dime, one tenth of a dollar. Hey-hey-hey.\n \u0027What\u0027s your game, might I ask?\u0027 the cabbie said.\n \u0027I teach high school in Cleaves.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, yeah? So you know what I mean. What the hell\u0027s wrong with these kids, anyway?\u0027\n Well, they ate a bad hot dog called Vietnam and it gave them ptomaine. A guy named Lyndon Johnson sold it to them. So they went to this other guy, see, and they said, \u0027Jesus, mister, I\u0027m sick as hell.\u0027 And this other guy, his name was Nixon, he said, \u0027I know how to fix that,\n Have a few more hot dogs.\u0027 And that\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with the youth of America.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said.\n \u0027You plan all your life and you do what you can,\u0027 the cabbie said, and now there was honest bewilderment in his voice, a bewilderment which would not last much longer because the cabbie was embarked upon the last minute of his life. And Johnny, who didn\u0027t know that, felt a real pity for the man, a sympathy for his inability to understand.\n Come on over baby, whole lotta shakin goin on.\n \u0027You never want nothing but the best, and the kid comes home with hair down to his asshole and says the president of the United States is a pig. A pig! Sheeyit, I don\u0027t...\u0027\n \u0027Look out!\u0027 Johnny yelled.\n The cabbie had half-turned to face him, his pudgy American Legionnaire\u0027s face earnest and angry and miserable in the dashlights and in the sudden glow of oncoming headlights. Now he snapped forward again, but too late.\n \u0027Jeeesus.. -,\n There were two cars, one on each side of the white line. They had been dragging, side by side, coming up over the hill, a Mustang and a Dodge Charger. Johnny could hear the revved-up whine of their engines. The Charger was boring straight down at them. It never tried to get out of the way and the cabbie froze at the wheel.\n \u0027Jeeeeee...\n Johnny was barely aware of the Mustang flashing by on their left. Then the cab and the Charger met head-on and Johnny felt himself getting lifted up and out. There was no pain, although he was marginally aware that his thighs had connected with the taximeter hard enough to rip it out of its frame.\n There was the sound of smashing glass. A huge gout of flame stroked its way up into the night. Johnny\u0027s head collided with the cab\u0027s windshield and knocked it out. Reality began to go down a hole. Pain, faint and far away, in his shoulders and arms as the rest of him followed his head through the jagged windshield. He was flying. Flying into the October night.\n Dim flashing thoughs Am I dying? Is this going to kill me?\n Interior voice answering: Yes, this is probably it.\n Flying. October stars flung across the night. Racketing boom of exploding gasoline. An orange glow. Then darkness.\n His trip through the void ended with a hard thump and a splash. Cold wetness as he went into Carson\u0027s Bog, twenty-five feet from where the Charger and the cab, welded together, pushed a pyre of flame into the night sky.\n Darkness.\n Fading.\n Until all that was left seemed to be a giant red-and-black wheel revolving in such emptiness as there may be between the stars, try your luck, first time fluky, second time lucky, hey-hey-hey. The wheel revolved up and down, red and black, the marker ticking past the pins, and he strained to see if it was going to come up double zero, house number, house spin, everybody loses but the house. He strained to see but the wheel was gone. There was only blackness and that universal emptiness, negatory, good buddy, el zilcho. Cold limbo.\n Johnny Smith stayed there a long, long time. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-3.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: \n Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
