{"id":93672,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"1.\\n\\n Johnny came up wooden steps that had been shoveled clear of snow and salted down. He went through a set of double doors and into a foyer plastered with specimen ballots and notices of a special town meeting to be held here in Jackson on the third of February. There was also a notice of Greg Stillson\u0027s impending visit and a picture of The Man Who himself, hard hat cocked back on his head, grinning that hard slantwise \u0027We\u0027re wise to em, ain\u0027t we, pard?\u0027 grin. Set a little to the right of the green door leading into the meeting hall itself was a sign that Johnny hadn\u0027t expected, and he pondered it in silence for several seconds, his breath pluming white from his lips. DRIVER EXAMINATIONS TODAY, this sign read. It was set on a wooden easel. HAVE PAPERS READY.\\n\\n He opened the door, went into the stuporous glow of heat thrown by a big woodstove, and there sat a cop at a desk. The cop was wearing a ski parka, unzipped. There were papers scattered across his desk, and there was also a gadget for examining visual acuity.\\n\\n The cop looked up at Johnny, and he felt a sinking sensation in his gut\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can I help you, sir?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny fingered the camera slung around his neck. \u0027Well, I wondered if it would be all right to look around a little bit,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m on assignment from Yankee magazine. We\u0027re doing a spread on town hall architecture in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Taking a lot of pictures, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go right to it,\u0027 the cop said. \u0027My wife reads Yankee all the time. Puts me to sleep.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny smiled. \u0027New England architecture has a tendency toward... well, starkness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Starkness,\u0027 the cop repeated doubtfully, and then let it go. \u0027Next, please.\u0027\\n\\n A young man approached the desk the cop was sitting behind. He handed an examination sheet to the cop, who took it and said, \u0027Look into the viewer, please, and identify the traffic signs and signals which I will show you.\\n\\n The young man peered into the viewing machine. The cop put an answer-key over the young man\u0027s exam sheet. Johnny moved down the center aisle of the Jackson town hall and clicked a picture of the rostrum at the front.\\n\\n \u0027Stop sign,\u0027 the young man said from behind him. \u0027The next one\u0027s a yield sign ... and the next one is a traffic information sign ... no right turn, no left turn, like that...\u0027\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t expected a cop in the town hall; he hadn\u0027t even bothered to buy film for the camera he was using as a prop. But now it was too late to back out anyway. This was Friday, and Stillson would be here tomorrow if things went the way they were supposed to go. He would be answering questions and listening to suggestions from the good people of Jackson. There would be a fair-sized entourage with him. A couple of aides, a couple of advisors - and several others, young men in sober suits and sports jackets who had been\u0027 wearing jeans and riding motorcycles not so long ago. Greg Stillson was still a firm believer in guards for the body. At the Trimbull rally they had been carrying sawedoff pool cues. Did they carry guns now? Would it be so difficult for a U.S. representative to get a permit to carry a concealed weapon? Johnny didn\u0027t think so. He could count on one good chance only; he would have to make the most of it. So it was important to look the place over, to try and decide if he could take Stillson in here or if it would be better to wait in the parking lot with the window rolled down and the rifle on his lap.\\n\\n So he had come and here he was, casing the joint while a state cop gave driver-permit exams not thirty feet away.\\n\\n There was a bulletin board on his left, and Johnny snapped his unloaded camera at it - why in God\u0027s name hadn\u0027t he taken another two minutes and bought himself a roll of film? The board was covered with chatty small-town intelligence concerning baked-bean suppers, an upcoming high school play, dog-licensing information, and, of course, more on Greg. A file card said that Jackson\u0027s first selectman was looking for someone who could take shorthand, and Johnny studied this as though it were of great interest to him while his mind moved into high gear.\\n\\n Of course if Jackson looked impossible - or even chancy - he could wait until next week, where Stillson would be doing the whole thing all over again in the town of Upson. Or the week after, in Trimbull. Or the week after that. Or never.\\n\\n It should be this week. It ought to be tomorrow.\\n\\n He snapped the big woodstove in the corner, and then glanced upward. There was a balcony up there. No - not precisely a balcony, more like a gallery with a waist-high railing and wide, white-painted slats with small, decorative diamonds and curlicues cut into the wood. It would be very possible for a man to crouch behind that railing and look through one of those doodads. At the right moment, he could just stand up and -\u0027What kind of camera is that?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny looked around, sure it was the cop. The cop would ask to see his filmless camera - and then he would want to see some ID - and then it would be all over.\\n\\n But it wasn\u0027t the cop. It was the young man who had been taking his driver\u0027s permit test. He was about twenty. two, with long hair and pleasant, frank eyes. He was wearing a suede coat and faded jeans.\\n\\n \u0027A Nikon,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027Good camera, man. I\u0027m a real camera nut. How long have you been working for Yankee?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m a free lance,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I do stuff for them, sometimes for Country Journal, sometimes for Downeast, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing national, like People or Life?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. At least, not yet. \u0027What f-stop do you use in here?\u0027 What in hell is an f-stop.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny shrugged. \u0027I play it mostly by ear.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027By eye, you mean,\u0027 the young man said, smiling. \u0027That\u0027s right, by eye.\u0027 Get lost, kid, please get lost. \u0027I\u0027m interested in f,ree4andng myself,\u0027 the young man said, and grinned. \u0027My big dream is to take a picture some day like the flag-raising at Iwo Jima.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I heard that was staged,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027Well, maybe. Maybe. But it\u0027s, a classic. Or how about the first picture of a UFO coming in for a landing? I\u0027d sure like that. Anyway, I\u0027ve got a portfolio of stuff I\u0027ve taken around here. Who\u0027s your contact at Yankee?\"\\n\\n Johnny was sweating now. \u0027Actually, they contacted me on this one,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was a...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Clawson, you can come over now,\u0027 the cop said, sounding impatient. \u0027I\u0027d like to go over these answers with you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whoops, his master\u0027s voice,\u0027 Clawson said. See you later, man.\u0027 He hurried off and Johnny let out his breath in a silent, whispering sigh. It was time to get out, and quickly.\\n\\n He snapped another two or three \u0027pictures\u0027 just so it wouldn\u0027t look like a complete rout, but he was barely aware of what he was looking at through the viewfinder. Then he left.\\n\\n The young man in the suede jacket - Clawson - had forgotten all about him, He had apparently flunked the written part of his exam. He was arguing strenuously with the cop, who was only shaking his head.\\n\\n Johnny paused for a moment in the town hall\u0027s entryway. To his left was a cloakroom. To his right was a closed door. He tried it and found it unlocked. A narrow flight of stairs led upward into dimness. The actual offices would be up there, of course. And the gallery.\\n\\n I.\\n\\n He was staying at the Jackson House, a pleasant little hotel on the main drag. It had been carefully renovated and the renovations had probably cost a lot of money, but the place would pay for itself, the owners must have reckoned, because of the new Jackson Mountain ski resort. Only the resort had gone bust and now the pleasant little hotel was barely hanging on. The night clerk was dozing over a cup of coffee when Johnny went out at four o\u0027clock on Saturday morning, the attache case in his left hand.\\n\\n He had slept little last night, slipping into a short, light doze after midnight. He had dreamed. It was 1970 again. It was carnival time. He and Sarah stood in front of the Wheel of Fortune and again he had that feeling of crazy, enormous power. In his nostrils he could smell burning rubber.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 a voice said softly behind him, \u0027I love to watch this guy take a beatin.\u0027 He turned and it was Frank Dodd, dressed in his black vinyl raincoat, his throat slit from ear to ear in a wide red grin, his eyes sparkling with dead vivaciousness. He turned back to the booth, scared - but now the pitchman was Greg Stillson, grinning knowingly at him, his yellow hard hat tipped cockily back on his skull. \u0027Hey-hey-hey,\u0027 Stillson chanted, his voice deep and resonant and ominous, \u0027Lay em down where you want em down, fella. What do you say? Want to shoot the moon?\u0027\\n\\n Yes, he wanted to shoot the moon. But as Stillson set the Wheel in motion he saw that the entire outer circle had turned green. Every number was double-zero. Every number was a house number.\\n\\n He had jerked awake and spent the rest of the night looking out the frost-rimmed window into darkness. The headache he\u0027d had ever since arriving in Jackson the day before was gone, leaving him feeling weak but composed. He sat with his hands in his lap. He didn\u0027t think about Greg Stillson; he thought about the past. He thought about his mother putting a Band-Aid on a scraped knee; he thought about the time the dog had torn off the back of Grandma Nellie\u0027s absurd sundress and how he had laughed and how Vera had swatted him one and cut his forehead with the stone in her engagement ring; he thought about his father showing him how to bait a fishing hook and saying, It doesn\u0027t hurt the worms, Johnny at least, I don\u0027t think it does. He thought about his father giving him a pocketknife for Christmas when he was seven and saying very seriously, I\u0027m trusting you) Johnny. All those memories had come back in a flood.\\n\\n Now he stepped off into the deep cold of the morning, his shoes squeaking on the path shoveled through the snow. His breath plumed out in front of him. The moon was down but the stars were sprawled across the black sky in idiot\u0027s profusion, God\u0027s jewel box, Vera always called it. You\u0027re looking into God\u0027s jewel box, Johnny.\\n\\n He walked down Main Street, and he stopped in front of the tiny Jackson post office and fumbled the letters out of his coat pocket. Letters to his father, to Sarah, to Sam Weizak, to Bannerman. He set the attache case down between his feet, opened the mailbox that stood in front of the neat little brick building, and after one brief moment of hesitation, dropped them in. He could hear them drop down inside, surely the first letters mailed in Jackson this new day, and the sound gave him a queer sense of finality, The letters were mailed, there was no stopping now.\\n\\n He picked up the case again and walked on. The only sound was the squeak of his shoes on the snow. The big thermometer over the door of the Granite State Savings Bank stood at 3 degrees, and the air had that feeling of total silent inertia that belongs exclusively to cold New Hampshire mornings. Nothing moved. The roadway was empty. The windshields of the parked cars were blinded with cataracts of frost. Dark windows, drawn shades. To Johnny it all seemed somehow dreadful and at the same time holy. He fought the feeling. This was no holy business he was on.\\n\\n He crossed Jasper Street and there was the town hall, standing white and austerely elegant behind its plowed banks of twinkling snow.\\n\\n What are you going to do if the front door\u0027s locked? Smart guy?\\n\\n Well, he would find a way to cross that bridge if he had to. Johnny looked around, but there was no one to see him. If this had been the president coming for one of his famous town meetings, everything would have been different, of course. The place would have been blocked off since the night before, and men would be stationed inside already. But this was only a U.S. representative, one of over four hundred, no big deal. No big deal yet.\\n\\n Johnny went up the steps and tried the door. The knob turned easily and he stepped into the cold entryway and pulled the door shut behind him. Now the headache was coming back, pulsing along with the steady thick beat of his heart. He set his case down and massaged his temples with his gloved fingers.\\n\\n There was a sudden low scream. The coat-closet door was opening, very slowly, and then something white was falling out of the shadows toward him.\\n\\n Johnny barely held back a cry. For one moment he thought it was a body, falling out of the closet like some-thing from a spook movie. But it was only a heavy cardboard sign that read PLEASE HAVE PAPERS IN ORDER BEFORE APPEARING FOR EXAMINATION.\\n\\n He set it back in place and then turned to the doorway giving upon the stairs.\\n\\n This door was now locked.\\n\\n He leaned down to get a better look at it in the dim white glow of the streetlight that filtered in the one window. It was a spring lock, and he thought he might be able to open it with a coat hanger. He found one in the coat closet and hooked the neck of it into the crack between the door and the jamb. He worked it down to the lock and began to fumble around. His head was thudding fiercely now. At last he heard the bolt snap back as the wire caught it. He pulled the door open. He picked up his attache case and went through, still holding the coat hanger. He pulled the door closed behind him and heard it lock again. He went up the narrow stairs, which creaked and groaned under his weight.\\n\\n At the top of the stairs there was a short hallway with several doors on either side. He walked down the hall, past TOWN MANAGER and TOWN SELECTMEN, past TAX ASSESSOR and MEN\u0027S and O\u0027SEER OF THE POOR and LADIES\u0027.\\n\\n There was an unmarked door at the end. It was unlocked and he came out onto the gallery above the rear of the meeting hall, which was spread out below him in a crazy quilt of shadows. He closed the door behind him and shivered a little at the soft stir of echoes in the empty hall. His footfalls also echoed back as he walked to the right along the rear gallery, then turned left. Now he was walking along the right-hand side of the hall, about twenty-five feet above the floor. He stopped at a point above the woodstove and directly across from the podium where Stillson would be standing in about five-and-a-half hours.\\n\\n He sat down cros-legged and rested for a while. Tried to get in control of the headache with some deep breathing. The woodstove wasn\u0027t operating and he felt the cold settling steadily against him - and then into him. Previews of the winding shroud.\\n\\n When he had begun to feel a little better, he thumbed the catches on the attache case. The double dick echoed back as his footfalls had done, and this time it was the sound of cocking pistols.\\n\\n Western justice, he thought, for no reason at all. That was what the prosecutor had said when the jury found Claudine Longet guilty of shooting her lover. She\u0027s found out what western justice means.\\n\\n Johnny looked down into the case and rubbed his eyes. His vision doubled briefly and then things came together again. He was getting an impression from the very wood he was sitting on. A very old impression; if it had been a photograph, it would have been sepia-toned. Men standing here and smoking cigars, talking and laughing and waiting for town meeting to begin. Had it been 1920? 1902? There was something ghostly about it that made him feel uneasy. One of them had been talking about the price of whiskey and cleaning his nose with a silver toothpick and\\n\\n (and two years before he had poisoned his wife)\\n\\n Johnny shivered. Whatever the impression was, it didn\u0027t matter. It was an impression of a man who was long dead now.\\n\\n The rifle gleamed up at him.\\n\\n When men do it in wartime, they give them medals, he thought.\\n\\n He began to assemble the rifle. Each click I echoed back, just once, solemnly, the sound of a cocking pistol.\\n\\n He loaded the Remington with five bullets.\\n\\n He placed it across his knees.\\n\\n And waited\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n Dawn came slowly. Johnny dozed a little, but he was too cold now to do more than doze. Thin, sketchy dreams haunted what sleep he did get.\\n\\n He came fully awake at a little past seven. The door below was thrown open with a crash, and he had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out, Who\u0027s there?\\n\\n It was the custodian. Johnny put his eye to one of the diamond shapes cut into the balustrade and saw a burly man who was bundled up in a thick Navy pea coat. He was coming up the center aisle with an armload of firewood. He was humming \u0027Red River Valley\u0027. He dropped the armload of wood into the woodbox with a crash and then disappeared below Johnny. A second later he heard the thin screcing noise of the stove\u0027s firebox door being swung open.\\n\\n Johnny suddenly thought of the plume of vapor be was producing every time he exhaled. Suppose the custodian looked up? Would he be able to see that?\\n\\n He tried to slow the rate of his breathing, but that made his head ache worse and his vision doubled alarmingly.\\n\\n Now there was the crackle of paper being crumpled, then the scratch of a match. A faint whiff of sulphur in the cold air. The custodian went on humming \u0027Red River Valley\u0027, and then broke into loud and tuneless song: \u0027From this valley they say you are going... we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smiiiiile...\u0027\\n\\n Now a different crackling sound. Fire.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s got it, you sucker,\u0027 the custodian said from directly below Johnny, and then there was the sound of the firebox door being slammed shut again. Johnny pressed both hands over his mouth like a bandage, suddenly afflicted with suicidal amusement. He saw himself rising up from the floor of the gallery, as thin and white as any self-respecting ghost. He saw himself spreading his arms like wings and his fingers like talons and calling down in hollow tones: \u0027That\u0027s got you, you sucker.\u0027\\n\\n He held the laughter behind his hands. His head throbbed like a tomato full of hot, expanding blood. His vision jittered and blurred crazily. Suddenly he wanted very badly to move away from the impression of the man who had been cleaning his nose with the silver toothpick, but he didn\u0027t dare make a sound. Dear Jesus, what if he had to sneeze?\\n\\n Suddenly, with no warning, a terrible wavering shriek filled the hall, drilling into Johnny\u0027s ears like thin silver nails, climbing, making his head vibrate. He opened his mouth to scream.-It cut off.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you whore,\u0027 the custodian said conversationally.\\n\\n Johnny looked through the diamond and saw the custodian standing behind the podium and fiddling with a microphone. The mike cord snaked down to a small portable amp. The custodian went down the few steps from the podium to the floor and pulled the amplifier farther from the mike, then fooled with the dials on top of it. He went back to the mike and turned it on again. There was another feedback whine, this one lower and then tapering away entirely. Johnny pressed his hands tight against his forehead and rubbed them back and forth.\\n\\n The custodian tapped on the mike with his thumb, and the sound filled the big empty room. It sounded like a fist knocking on a coffin lid. Then his voice, still tuneless, but now amplified to the point of monstrosity, a giant\u0027s voice bludgeoning into Johnny\u0027s head: \u0027FROM THIS VAL-LEEE THEY SAY YOU ARE GOING...\u0027\\n\\n Stop it, Johnny wanted to scream. Oh, please stop it, I\u0027m going crazy, can\u0027t you stop it?\\n\\n The singing ended with a loud, amplified snap! and the custodian said in his own voice, \u0027That\u0027s got you, whore.\u0027\\n\\n He walked out of Johnny\u0027s line of sight again. There was a sound of tearing paper and the low popping sounds of twine being snapped. Then the custodian reappeared, whistling and holding a large stack of booklets. He began to place them at close intervals along the benches.\\n\\n When he had finished that chore, the custodian buttoned his coat and left the hall. The door slammed hollowly shut behind him. Johnny looked at his watch. It was 7: 45. The town hall was warming up a little. He sat and waited. The headache was still very bad, but oddly enough. it was easier to bear than it had ever been before. All he had to do was tell himself that he wouldn\u0027t have to bear it for long.\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n The doors slammed open again promptly at nine o\u0027clock, startling him out of a catnap. His hands clamped tightly over the rifle and then relaxed. He put his eye to the diamond-shaped peephole. Four men this time. One of them was the custodian, the collar of his pea coat turned up against his neck. The other three were wearing topcoats with suits underneath. Johnny felt his heartbeat quicken. One of them was Sonny Elliman. His hair was cut short now and handsomely styled, but the brilliant green eyes had not changed.\\n\\n \u0027Everything set?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Check for yourself,\u0027 the custodian said.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t be offended, Dad,\u0027 one of the others replied. They were moving to the front of the hall. One of them clicked the amplifier on and then clicked it off again, satisfied.\\n\\n \u0027People round these parts act like he was the bloody emperor,\u0027 the custodian grumbled.\\n\\n \u0027He is, be is,\u0027 the third man said - Johnny thought he also recognized this fellow from the Trimbull rally. \u0027Haven\u0027t you got wise to that yet, Pop?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you been upstairs?\u0027 Elliman asked the custodian, and Johnny went cold.\\n\\n \u0027Stairway door\u0027s locked,\u0027 the custodian answered. \u0027Same as always. I gave her a shake.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny silently gave thanks for the spring lock on the door.\\n\\n \u0027Ought to check it out,\u0027 Elliman said.\\n\\n The custodian uttered an exasperated laugh. \u0027I don\u0027t know about you guys,\u0027 he said. \u0027Who are you expecting? The Phantom of the Opera?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on Sonny,\u0027 the fellow Johnny thought he recognized said. \u0027There\u0027s nobody up there, We just got time for a coffee if we shag ass down to that resrunt on the corner.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not coffee,\u0027 Sonny said. \u0027Fucking mud is all that is. Just run upstairs first and make sure no one\u0027s there, Moochie. We go by the book.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny licked his lips and clutched the gun. He looked up and down the narrow gallery. To his right it ended in a blank wall. To his left it went back to the suite of offices, and either way it made no difference. If he moved, they would hear him. This empty, the town hall served as a natural amplifier. He was stuck.\\n\\n There were footfalls down below. Then the sound of the door between the hall and the entryway being opened and closed. Johnny waited, frozen and helpless. Just below him the custodian and the other two were talking, but he heard nothing they said. His head had turned on his neck like some slow engine and he stared down the length of the gallery, waiting for the fellow Sonny Elliman had called Moochie to appear at the end of it. His bored expression would suddenly turn to shock and incredulity, his mouth would open: Hey Sonny, there\u0027s a guy up here!\\n\\n Now he could hear the muffled sound of Moochie climbing the stairs. He tried to think of something, anything. Nothing came. They were going to discover him, it was less than a minute away now, and he didn\u0027t have any idea of how to stop it from happening. No matter what he did, his one chance was on the verge of being blown.\\n\\n Doors began to open and close, the sound of each drawing closer and less muffled. A drop of sweat spilled from Johnny\u0027s forehead and darkened the leg of his jeans. He could remember each door he had come past on his way here. Moochie had checked TOWN MANAGER and TOWN SELECTMEN and TAX ASSESSOR. Now he was opening the door of MEN\u0027S, now he was glancing through the office that belonged to the O\u0027SEER OF THE POOR, now the LADIES\u0027 room. The next door would be the one leading to the galleries.\\n\\n It opened.\\n\\n There was the sound of two footfalls as Moochie approached the railing of the short gallery that ran along the back of the hall. \u0027Okay, Sonny? You satisfied?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everything look good?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Looks like a fucking dump,\u0027 Moochie responded, and there was a burst of laughter from below.\\n\\n \u0027Well, come on down and let\u0027s go for coffee,\u0027 the third man said. And incredibly, that was it. The door slammed to. The footsteps retreated back down the hall, and then down the steps to the first floor.\\n\\n Johnny went limp and for a moment everything swam away from him into shades of gray. The slam of the entryway door as they went out for their coffee brought him partially out of it.\\n\\n Below, the custodian presented his judgment: \u0027Bunch of whores.\u0027 Then he left, too, and for the next twenty minutes or so, there was only Johnny.\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n Around 9: ~O A.M., the people of Jackson began to file into their town hall. The first to appear was a trio of old ladies dressed in formal black, chattering together like magpies. Johnny watched them pick seats close to the stove - almost entirely out of the field of his vision - and pick up the booklets that had been left on the seats. The booklets appeared to be filled with glossy pictures of Greg Stillson.\\n\\n \u0027I just love that man,\u0027 one of the three said. \u0027I\u0027ve gotten his autograph three times and I\u0027ll get it again today, I\u0027ll be bound.\u0027\\n\\n That was all the talk there was about Greg Stillson. The ladies went on to discuss the impending Old Home Sunday at the Methodist Church.\\n\\n Johnny, almost directly over the stove, went from very cold to very hot. He had taken advantage of the slack tide between the departure of Stillson\u0027s security people and the arrival of the first townfolk, using it to shed both his jacket and his outer shirt. He kept wiping sweat from his face with a handkerchief, and the linen was streaked with blood as well as sweat. His bad eye was kicking up again, and his vision was constantly blurred and reddish.\\n\\n The door below opened, there was the hearty tromp-tromp-tromp of men stamping snow from their pacs, and then four men in checked woolen jackets came down the aisle and sat in the front row. One of them launched immediately into a Frenchman joke.\\n\\n A young woman of about twenty-three arrived with her son, who looked about four. The boy was wearing a blue snowmobile suit with bright yellow markings, and he wanted to know if he could talk into the microphone.\\n\\n \u0027No, dear,\u0027 the woman said, and they went down behind the men. The boy immediately began to kick his feet against the bench in front of him, and one of the men glanced back over his shoulder,\\n\\n \u0027Sean, stop that,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Quarter of ten now. The door was opening and closing with a steady regularity. Men and women of all types and occupations and ages were filling up the hall. There was a drifting hum of conversation, and it was edged with an indefinable sense of anticipation. They weren\u0027t here to quiz their duly-elected representative; they were waiting for a bona-fide star turn in their small community. Johnny knew that most \u0027meet-your-candidate\u0027 and \u0027meet-your-representative\u0027 sessions were attended by a handful of die-hards in the nearly empty meeting halls. During the election of 1976 a debate between Maine\u0027s Bill Cohen and his challenger, Leighton Cooney, had attracted all of twenty-six people, press aside. The skull-sessions were so much window-dressing, a self-testimonial to wave when election time came around again. Most could have been held in a middling-sized closet. But by 10 A.M., every seat in the town hall was taken, and there were twenty or thirty standees at the back. Every time the door opened, Johnny\u0027s hands tensed down on the rifle. And he was still not positive he could do it, no matter what the stakes.\\n\\n Five past, ten past. Johnny began to think Stillson had been held up, or was perhaps not coming at all. And the feeling which moved stealthily through him was one of relief.\\n\\n Then the door opened again and a hearty voice called:\\n\\n \u0027Hey! How ya doin, Jackson, N.H.?\u0027\\n\\n A startled, pleased murmur. Someone called ecstatic-ally, \u0027Greg! How are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m feeling perky,\u0027 Stillson came right back, \u0027How the heck are you?\u0027\\n\\n A spatter of applause quickly swelled to a roar of approval.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, all right!\u0027 Greg shouted over it. He moved quickly down the aisle, shaking hands, toward the podium.\\n\\n Johnny watched him through his loophole. Stillson was wearing a heavy rawhide coat with a sheepskin collar, and today the hard hat had been replaced with a woolen ski cap with a bright red tassel. He paused at the head of the aisle and waved at the three or four press in attendance. Flashbulbs popped and the applause got its second wind, shaking the rafters.\\n\\n And Johnny Smith suddenly knew it was now or never. The feelings he had had about Greg Stillson at the Trimbull rally suddenly swept over him again with a certain and terrible clarity. Inside his aching, tortured head he seemed to hear a dull wooden sound, two things coming together with a terrible force at one single moment. It was, perhaps, the sound of destiny. It would be too easy to delay, to let Stillson talk and talk. Too easy to let him get away, to Sit up here with bis head in his hands, waiting as the crowd thinned out, waiting as the custodian returned to dismantle the sound system and sweep up the litter, all the time kidding himself that there would be next week in another town.\\n\\n The time was now, indisputably now, and every human being on earth suddenly had a stake in what happened in this backwater meetinghouse.\\n\\n That thudding sound in his head, like poles of destiny coming together.\\n\\n Stillson was mounting the steps to the podium. The area behind him was clear. The three men in their open topcoats were lounging against the far wall.\\n\\n Johnny stood up.\\n\\n 6.\\n\\n Everything seemed to happen in slow motion.\\n\\n There were cramps in his legs from sitting so long. His knees popped like dud firecrackers. Time seemed frozen, the applause went on and on even though heads were turning, necks were craning; someone screamed through the applause and still it went on; someone had screamed because there was a man in the gallery and the man was holding a rifle and this was something they had all seen on TV, it was a situation with classic elements that they all recognized. In its own way, it was as American as The Wonderful World of Disney. The politician and the man in a high place with the gun.\\n\\n Greg Stillson turned toward him, his thick neck craning, wrinkling into creases. The red puff on the top of his ski cap bobbed.\\n\\n Johnny put the rifle to his shoulder. It seemed to float up there and he felt the thud as it socketed home next to the joint there. He thought of shooting partridge with his dad as a boy. They had gone deer-hunting but the only time Johnny had ever seen one he had not been able to pull the trigger; the buck fever had gotten him. It was a secret, as shameful as masturbation, and he had never told anyone.\\n\\n There was another scream. One of the old ladies was clutching her mouth and Johnny saw there was artificial fruit scattered along the wide brim of her black hat, Faces turned up to him, big white zeros. Open mouths, small black zeros. The little boy in the snowmobile suit was pointing. His mother was trying to shield him. Still-son was in the gunsight suddenly and Johnny remembered to flick off the rifle\u0027s safety. Across the way the men in the topcoats were reaching inside their jackets and Sonny Elliman, his green eyes blazing, was hollering:\\n\\n Down! Greg, get DOWN!\u0027\\n\\n But Stillson stared up into the gallery and for the second time their eyes locked together in a perfect sort of understanding, and Stillson only ducked at the same instant Johnny fired. The rifle\u0027s roar was loud, filling the place, and the slug took away nearly one whole corner of the podium, peeling it back to the bare, bright wood. Splinters flew. One of them struck the microphone, and there was another monstrous whine of feedback that suddenly ended in a guttural, low-key buzzing.\\n\\n Johnny pumped another cartridge into the chamber and fired again. This time the slug punched a hole through the dusty carpeting of the dais.\\n\\n The crowd had started to move, panicky as cattle. They all drove into the center aisle. The people who had been standing at the rear escaped easily, but then a bottleneck of cursing, screaming men and women formed in the double doorway.\\n\\n There were popping noises from the other side of the hall, and suddenly part of the gallery railing splintered up in front of Johnny\u0027s eyes. Something screamed past his ear a second later. Then an invisible finger gave the collar of his shirt a flick. All three of them across the way were holding handguns, and because Johnny was up in the gallery, their field of fire was crystal clear - but Johnny doubted if they would have bothered overmuch about innocent bystanders anyway.\\n\\n One of the trio of old women grabbed Moochie\u0027s arm. She was sobbing, trying to ask something. He flung her away and steadied his gun in both hands. There was a stink of gunpowder in the hall now. It had been about twenty seconds since Johnny had stood up.\\n\\n \u0027Down! Down, Greg!\u0027\\n\\n Stillson was still standing at the edge of the dais, crouching slightly, looking up. Johnny brought the rifle down, and for an instant Stilison was dead-bang in front sight. Then a pistol-slug grooved his neck, knocking him backward, and his own shot went wild into the air. The window across the way dissolved in a tinkling rain of glass. Thin screams drifted up from below. Blood poured down and across his shoulder and chest.\\n\\n Oh, you\u0027re doing a great job of killing him, he thought hysterically, and pushed back to the railing again. He levered another cartridge into the breech and threw it to his shoulder again. Now Stilison was on the move. He darted down the steps to floor4evel and then glanced up at Johnny again.\\n\\n Another bullet whizzed by his temple. I\u0027m bleeding like a stuck pig, he thought. Come on. Come on and get this over.\\n\\n The bottleneck at the entryway broke, and now people began to pour out. A puff of smoke rose from the barrel of one of the pistols across the way, there was a bang, and the invisible finger that had flicked his collar a few seconds ago now drew a line of fire across the side of Johnny\u0027s head. It didn\u0027t matter. Nothing mattered except taking Stillson. He brought the rifle down again.\\n\\n Make this one count -Stillson moved with good speed for such a big man.\\n\\n The dark-haired young woman Johnny had noticed earlier was about halfway up the center aisle, holding her crying son in her arms, still trying to shield him with her body. And what Stillson did then so dumbfounded Johnny that he almost dropped the rifle altogether. He snatched the boy from his mother\u0027s arms, whirled toward the gallery, holding the boy\u0027s body in front of him. It was no longer Greg Stillson in the front sight, but a small squirming figure in\\n\\n (the filter blue filter yellow stripes tiger stripes)\\n\\n a dark blue snowmobile suit with bright yellow piping. Johnny\u0027s mouth dropped open. It was Stillson, all right. The tiger. But he was behind the filter now.\\n\\n What does it mean? Johnny screamed, but no sound passed his lips.\\n\\n The mother screamed shrilly then; but Johnny had heard it all somewhere before. \u0027Tommy! Give him to me!\\n\\n TOMMY! GIVE HIM TO ME, YOU BASTARD!\u0027\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s head was swelling blackly, expanding like a bladder. Everything was starting to fade. The only brightness left was centered around the notched gunsight, the gunsight now laid directly over the chest of that blue snowmobile suit.\\n\\n Do it, oh for Christ\u0027s sake you have to do it he\u0027ll get away -And now - perhaps it was only his blurring eyesight that made it seem so - the blue snowmobile suit began to spread, its color washing out to the light robin\u0027s egg color of the vision, the dark yellow stretching, striping, until everything began to be lost in it.\\n\\n (behind the filter. yes, he\u0027s behind the filter, but what does it mean? does it mean it\u0027s safe or just that he\u0027s beyond my reach? what does it)\\n\\n Warm fire flashed somewhere below and was gone. Some dim part of Johnny\u0027s mind registered it as a flashbulb.\\n\\n Stilison shoved the woman away and backed toward the door, eyes squeezed into calculating pirate\u0027s slits. He held the squirming boy firmly by the neck and the crotch.\\n\\n Can\u0027t. Oh dear God forgive me, I can\u0027t.\\n\\n Two more bullets struck him then, one high in the chest, driving him back against the wall and bouncing him off it, the second into the left side of his midsection, spinning him around into the gallery railing. He was dimly aware that he had lost the rifle. It struck the gallery floor and discharged point-blank into the wall. Then his upper thighs crashed into the ballustrade and he was falling. The town hall turned over twice before his eyes and then there was a splintering crash as he struck two of the benches, breaking his back and both legs.\\n\\n He opened his mouth to scream, but what came out was a great gush of blood. He lay in the splintered remains of the benches he had struck and thought: It\u0027s over. I punked out. Blew it.\\n\\n Hands were on him, not gentle. They were turning him over. Elliman, Moochie, and the other guy were there. Elliman was the one who had turned him over.\\n\\n Stillson came, shoving Moochie aside.\\n\\n \u0027Never mind this guy,\u0027 he said harshly. \u0027Find the son of a bitch that took that picture. Smash his camera.\\n\\n Moochie and the other guy left. Somewhere close by the woman with the dark hair was crying out:\\n\\n behind a kid, hiding behind a kid and I\u0027ll tell every-body...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut her up, Sonny,\u0027 Stillson said.\\n\\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 Sonny said, and left Stillson\u0027s side.\\n\\n Stillson got down on his knees above Johnny. \u0027Do we know each other, fella? No sense lying. You\u0027ve had the course.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny whispered, \u0027We knew each other.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was that Trimbull rally, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny nodded.\\n\\n Stillson got up abruptly, and with the last bit of his strength Johnny reached out and grasped his ankle. It was only for a second; Stillson pulled free easily. But it was long enough.\\n\\n Everything had changed.\\n\\n People were drawing near him now, but he saw only feet and legs, no faces. It didn\u0027t matter. Everything had changed.\\n\\n He began to cry a little. Touching Stillson this time had been like touching a blank. Dead battery. Fallen tree. Empty house. Bare bookshelves. Wine bottles ready for candles.\\n\\n Fading. Going away. The feet and legs around him were becoming misty and indistinct. He heard their voices, the excited gabble of speculation, but not the words. Only the sound of the words, and even that was fading, blurring into a high, sweet humming sound.\\n\\n He looked over his shoulder and there was the corridor he had emerged from so long ago. He had come out of that corridor and into this bright placental place. Only then his mother had been alive and his father had been there, calling him by name, until he broke through to them. Now it was only time to go back. Now it was right to go back.\\n\\n I did it. Somehow I did it. I don\u0027t understand how, but I have.\\n\\n He let himself drift toward that corridor with the dark chrome walls, not knowing if there might be something at the far end of it or not, content to let time show him that. The sweet hum of the voices faded. The misty brightness faded. But he was still he - Johnny Smith - intact.\\n\\n Get into the corridor, he thought. All right.\\n\\n He thought that if he could get into that corridor, he would be able to walk.\\n\\n PART THREE\\n\\n Notes from the Dead Zone\\n\\n 1.\\n\\n Dear Dad,\\n\\n Portsmouth, N.H. January23, 1979\\n\\n This is a terrible letter to have to write, and I will try to keep it short. When you get it, I guess I will probably be dead. An awful thing has happened to me, and I think now that it may have started a long time before the car accident and the coma. You know about the psychic business, of course, and you may remember Mom swearing on her deathbed that God had meant for it to be this way, that God had something for me to do. She asked me not to run from it, and I promised her that I wouldn\u0027t - not meaning it seriously, but wanting her mind to be easy. Now it looks as if she was right, in a funny sort of way. I still don\u0027t really believe in God, not in a real Being who plans for us and gives us all little jobs to do, like Boy Scouts winning merit badges on The Great Hike of Life. But neither do I believe that all the things that have happened to me are blind chance.\\n\\n In the summer of 1976, Dad, I went to a Greg Stillson rally in Trim bull, which is in New Hampshire\u0027s third district. He was running for the first time then, you may recall. When he was on his way to the speaker\u0027s rostrum he shook a lot of hands, and one of them was mine. This is the part you may find hard to believe, even though you have seen the ability in action. l had one of my \u0027flashes\u0027, only this one was no flash, Dad. It was a vision, either in the biblical sense or in something very near it. Oddly enough, it wasn\u0027t as clear as some of my other \u0027insights\u0027 have been - there was a Puzzling blue glow over every-thing that has never been there before - but it was incredibly powerful. I saw Greg Stillson as president of the United States. How far in the future I can\u0027t say, except that he had lost most of his hair. I would say fourteen years, or perhaps eighteen at the most. Now, my ability is to see and not to interpret, and in this case my ability to see was impeded by that funny blue filter, but l saw enough. If Stillson becomes president, he\u0027s going to worsen an international situation that is going to be pretty awful to begin with. If Stillson becomes president, he is going to end up precipitating a full-scale nuclear war. I believe that the initial flash point for this war is going to be in South Africa. And I also believe that in the short, bloody course of this war, it\u0027s not going to be just two or three nations throwing warheads, but maybe as many as twenty - plus terrorist groups.\\n\\n Daddy, I know how crazy this must look. It looks crazy to me. But I have no doubts, no urge to look back over my shoulder and try to second-guess this thing into something less real and urgent than it is. You never knew -no one did - but l didn\u0027t run away from the Chatsworths because of that restaurant fire. I guess I was running away from Greg Stillson and the thing I am supposed to do. Like Elijah hiding in his cave or Jonah, who ended up in the fish\u0027s belly. I thought I would just wait and see, you know. Wait and see if the preconditions for such a horrible future began to come into place. I would probably be waiting still, but in the fall of last year the headaches began to get worse, and there was an incident on the roadcrew I was working with. l guess Keith Strang, the foreman, would remember that ...\\n\\n Excerpt from testimony given before the so-called \u0027Stillson Committee\u0027, chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine. The questioner is Mr. Norman D. Verizer, the Committee\u0027s Chief Counsel. The witness is Mr. Keith Strang, of 1421 Desert Boulevard, Phoenix, Arizona. Date of testimony: August 17, 1979.\\n\\n Verizer: And at this time, John Smith was in the employ of the Phoenix Public Works Department, was he not?\\n\\n Strang: Yes, Sir, he was.\\n\\n V: This was early December of 1978.\\n\\n S: Yes, Sir.\\n\\n V: And did something happen on December 7 that you particularly remember? Something concerning John Smith?\\n\\n S: Yes, Sir. It sure did.\\n\\n V: Tell the Committee about that, if you would.\\n\\n S: Well, I had to go back to the central motor pool to get two forty-gallon drums of orange paint. We were lining roads, you understand. Johnny - that\u0027s Johnny Smith -was out on Rosemont Avenue on the day you\u0027re talking about, putting down new lane markings. Well, I got back out there at approximately four-fifteen - about forty-five minutes before knocking-off time - and this fellow Herman Joellyn that you\u0027ve already talked to, he comes up to me and says, \u0027You better check on Johnny, Keith. Something\u0027s wrong with Johnny. I tried to talk to him and he acted like he didn\u0027t hear. He almost run me down. You better get him straight.\u0027 That\u0027s what he said. So I said, \u0027What\u0027s wrong with him, Hermie?\u0027 And Hermie says, \u0027Check it out for yourself, there\u0027s something offwhack with that dude.\u0027 So I drove on up the road, and at first everything was all right, and then - wow!\\n\\n V: What did you see?\\n\\n S: Before I saw Johnny, you mean.\\n\\n V: Yes, that\u0027s right.\\n\\n S: The line he was putting down started to go haywire. Just a little bit at first - a jig here and there, a little bubble - it wasn\u0027t perfectly straight, you know. And Johnny had always been the best liner on the whole crew. Then it started to get really bad. It started to go all over the road in these big loops and swirls. Some places it was like he\u0027d gone right round in circles a few times. For about a hundred yards he\u0027d put the stripe right along the dirt shoulder.\\n\\n V: What did you do?\\n\\n S: I stopped him. That is, eventually I stopped him. I pulled up right beside the lining machine and started yelling at him. Must have yelled half a dozen times. It was like he didn\u0027t hear. Then he swooped that thing toward me and put a helluva ding in the side of the car I was driving. Highway Department Property, too. So I laid on the horn and yelled at him again, and that seemed to get through to him. He threw it in neutral and looked over at me. I asked him what in the name of God he thought he was doing.\\n\\n V: And what was his response?\\n\\n S: He said hi. That was all. \u0027Hi, Keith.\u0027 Like everything was hunky-dory.\\n\\n V: And your response was...?\\n\\n S: My response was pretty blue. I was mad. And Johnny is just standing there, looking all around and holding onto the side of the liner like he would fall down if he let go. That was when I realized how sick he looked. He was always thin, you know, but now he looked as white as paper, and the side of his mouth was kind of ...you know... drawn down. At first he didn\u0027t even seem to get what I was saying. Then he looked around and saw the way that line was - all over the road.\\n\\n V: And he said...?\\n\\n S: Said he was sorry. Then he kind of - I don\u0027t know -staggered, and put one hand up to his face. So I asked him what was wrong with him and he said... oh, a lot of confused stuff. It didn\u0027t mean anything.\\n\\n Cohen: Mr. Strang, the Committee is particularly interested in anything Mr. Smith said that might cast a light on this matter. Can you remember what he said?\\n\\n S: Well, at first he said there was nothing wrong except that it smelled like rubber tires. Tires on fire. Then he said, \u0027That battery will explode if you try to jump it.\u0027 And something like, \u0027I got potatoes in the chest and both radios are in the sun. So it\u0027s all out for the trees.\u0027 That\u0027s the best I can remember. Like I say, it was all confused and crazy.\\n\\n V: What happened then?\\n\\n S: He started to fall down. So I grabbed him by the shoulder and his hand - he had been holding it against the side of his face - it came away. And I saw his right eye was full of blood. Then he passed out.\\n\\n V: But he said one more thing before he passed out, did he not?\\n\\n S: Yes, Sir, he did.\\n\\n V: And what was that?\\n\\n S: He said, \u0027We\u0027ll worry about Stillson later, Daddy, he\u0027s in the dead zone now.\u0027\\n\\n V: Are you sure that\u0027s what he said?\\n\\n S: Yes, Sir, I am. I\u0027ll never forget it.\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n ... and when I woke up I was in the small equipment. shed at the base of Rosemont Drive. Keith said I\u0027d better get to see a doctor right away, and I wasn\u0027t to come back to work until I did. I was scared, Dad, but not for the reasons Keith thought,. I guess. Anyway, I made an appointment to see a neurologist that Sam Weizak had mentioned to me in a letter he wrote in early November. You see, I had written to Sam telling him that I was afraid to drive a car because I was having some incidents of double vision. Sam wrote back right away and told me to go see this Dr. Vann - said he considered the symptoms very alarming, but wouldn\u0027t presume to diagnose long-distance.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t go right away. I guess your mind can screw you over pretty well, and l kept thinking right up to the incident with the road-lining machine - that it was just a phase I was going through and that it would get better. I guess I just didn\u0027t want to think about the alternative. But the road-lining incident was too much. I went, because I was getting scared - not just for myself, because of what I knew.\\n\\n So I went to see this Dr. Vann, and he gave me the tests, and then he laid it. out for me. It turned out I didn\u0027t have as much time as I thought, because...\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n Excerpt from testimony given before the so-called \u0027Stillson Committee\u0027, chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine. The questioner is Mr. Norman D. Verizer, the Committee\u0027s Chief Counsel. The witness is Dr. Quentin M. Vann, of 17 Parkland Drive, Phoenix, Arizona. Date of testimony: August 22, 1979.\\n\\n Verizer: After your tests were complete and your diagnosis was complete, you saw John Smith in your office, didn\u0027t you?\\n\\n Vann: Yes. It was a difficult meeting. Such meetings are always difficult.\\n\\n Ve: Can you give us the substance of what passed between you?\\n\\n Va: Yes. Under these unusual circumstances, I believe that the doctor-patient relationship may be waived. I began by pointing out to Smith that he had had a terribly frightening experience. He agreed. His right eye was still extremely bloodshot, but it was better. He had ruptured a small capillary. If I may refer to the chart...\\n\\n (Material deleted and condensed at this point)\\n\\n Ve: And after making this explanation to Smith?\\n\\n Va: He asked me for the bottom line. That was his phrase; \u0027the bottom line\u0027. In a quiet way he impressed me with his calmness and his courage.\\n\\n Ve: And the bottom line was what, Dr. Vann?\\n\\n Va: Ah? I thought that would be clear by now. John Smith had an extremely well-developed brain tumor in the parietal lobe.\\n\\n (Disorder among spectators; short recess)\\n\\n Ve: Doctor, I\u0027m sorry about this interruption. I\u0027d like to remind the spectators that this Committee is in session, and that it is an investigatory body, not a freak-show. I\u0027ll have order or I\u0027ll have the Sergeant-at-Arms clear the room.\\n\\n Va: That is quite all right, Mr. Verizer.\\n\\n Ve: Thank you, Doctor. Can you tell the Committee how Smith took the news?\\n\\n Va: He was calm. Extraordinarily calm. I believe that in his heart he had formed his own diagnosis, and that his and mine happened to coincide. He said that he was badly scared, however. And he asked me how long he had to live.\\n\\n Ve: What did you tell him?\\n\\n Va: I said that at that point such a question was meaningless, because our options were all still open. I told him he would need an operation. I should point out that at this time I had no knowledge of his coma and his extraordinary - almost miraculous - recovery.\\n\\n Ve: And what was his response?\\n\\n Va: He said there would be no operation. He was quiet but very, very firm. No operation. I said that I hoped he would reconsider, because to turn such an operation down would be to sign his own death-warrant.\\n\\n Ve: Did Smith make any response to this?\\n\\n Va: He asked me to give him my best opinion on how long he could live without such an operation.\\n\\n Ve: Did you give him your opinion?\\n\\n Va: I gave him a ballpark estimate, yes. I told. him that tumors have extremely erratic growth patterns, and that I had known patients whose tumors had fallen dormant for as long as two years, but that such a dormancy was quite rare. I told him that without an operation he might reasonably expect to live from eight to twenty months.\\n\\n Ve: But he still declined the operation, is that right?\\n\\n Va: Yes, that is so.\\n\\n Ve: Did something unusual happen as Smith was leaving?\\n\\n Va: I would say it was extremely unusual.\\n\\n Ve: Tell the Committee about that, if you would.\\n\\n Va: I touched his shoulder, meaning to restrain him, I suppose. I was unwilling to see the man leave under those circumstances, you understand. And I felt something coming from him when I did ... it was a sensation like an electric shock, but it was also an oddly draining, debilitating sensation. As if he were drawing something from me. I will grant you that this is an extremely subjective description, but it comes from a man trained in the art and craft of professional observation. It was not pleasant, I assure you I... drew away from him... and he suggested I call my wife because Strawberry had hurt himself seriously.\\n\\n Ve: Strawberry?\\n\\n Va: Yes, that\u0027s what he said. My wife\u0027s brother ... his name is Stanbury Richards. My youngest son always called him Uncle Strawberry when he was very small. That association didn\u0027t occur until later, by the way. That evening I suggested to my wife that she call her brother, who lives in the town of Goose Lake, New York.\\n\\n Ve: Did she call him?\\n\\n Va: Yes, she did. They had a very nice chat.\\n\\n Ve: And was Mr. Richards - your brother-in-law - was he all right?\\n\\n Va: Yes, he was fine. But the following week he fell from a ladder while painting his house and broke\u0027 his back.\\n\\n Ve: Dr. Vann, do you believe John Smith saw that happen? Do you believe that he had a precognitive vision concerning your wife\u0027s brother?\\n\\n Va: I don\u0027t know. But I believe that it may have been so.\\n\\n Ve: Thank you, Dr....\\n\\n Va: May I say one more thing?\\n\\n Ve: Of course.\\n\\n Va: If he did have such a curse - yes, I would call it a curse - I hope God will show pity to that man\u0027s tortured soul.\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n and I know, Dad, that people are going to say that I did what I am planning to do because of the tumor, but Daddy, don\u0027t believe them. It isn\u0027t true. The tumor is only the accident finally catching up with me, the accident which I now believe never stopped happening. The tumor lies in the same area that was injured in the crash, the same area that I now believe was probably bruised when I was a child and took a fall one day while skating on Runaround Pond. That was when I had the first of my \u0027flashes\u0027, although even now I cannot remember exactly what it was. And I had another just before the accident, at the Esty Fair. Ask Sarah about that one; I\u0027m sure she remembers. The tumor lies in that area which I always called \u0027the dead zone\u0027. And that turned out to be right, didn\u0027t it? All too bitterly right. God ... destiny providence... fate... whatever you want to call it, seems to be reaching out with its steady and unarguable hand to put the scales back in balance again. Perhaps l was meant to die in that car-crash, or even earlier, that day on the Runaround. And I believe that when I\u0027ve finished what I have to finish, the scales will come completely back into balance again.\\n\\n Daddy, I love you. The worst thing, next to the belief that the gun is the only way out of this terrible deadlock I find myself in, is knowing that I\u0027ll be leaving you behind to bear the grief and hate of those who have no reason to believe Stillson is anything but a good and just man...\\n\\n 6.\\n\\n Excerpt from testimony given before the so-called \u0027Stillson Committee\u0027, chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine. The questioner is Mr. Albert Renfrew, the Committee\u0027s Deputy Counsel. The witness is Dr. Samuel Weizak, of 26 Harlow Court, Bangor, Maine.\\n\\n Date of testimony: August 23, 1979.\\n\\n Renfrew: We are now approaching the hour of adjournment, Dr. Weizak, and on behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank you for the last four long hours of testimony. You have offered a great deal of light on the situation.\\n\\n Weizak: That is quite all right.\\n\\n R: I have one final question for you, Dr. Weizak, one which seems to me to be of nearly ultimate importance; it speaks to an issue which John Smith himself raised in the letter to his father which has been entered into evidence. That question is...\\n\\n W: No.\\n\\n R: I beg your pardon?\\n\\n W: You are preparing to ask me if Johnny\u0027s tumor pulled the trigger that day in New Hampshire, are you not?\\n\\n R: In a manner of speaking, I suppose...\\n\\n W: The answer is no. Johnny Smith was a thinking, reasoning human being until the end of his life. The letter to his father shows this; his letter to Sarah Hazlett also shows this. He was a man with a terrible, Godlike power perhaps a curse, as my colleague Dr. Vann has called it - but he was neither unhinged nor acting upon fantasies caused by cranial pressure - if such a thing is even possible.\\n\\n R: But isn\u0027t it true that Charles Witman, the so-called \u0027Texas Tower Sniper\u0027, had...\\n\\n W: Yes, yes, he had a tumor. So did the pilot of the Eastern Airlines airplane that crashed in Florida some years ago. And it has never been suggested that the tumor was a precipitating cause in either case. I would point out to you that other infamous creatures -Richard Speck; the so-called \u0027Son of Sam\u0027, and Adolf Hitler - needed no brain tumors to cause them to act in a homicidal manner. Or Frank Dodd, the murderer Johnny himself uncovered in the town of Castle Rock. However misguided this Committee may find Johnny\u0027s act to have been, it was the act of a man who was sane. In great mental agony, perhaps - but sane.\\n\\n 7.\\n\\n ... and most of all, don\u0027t believe that I did this without the longest and most agonizing reflection. If by killing him I could be sure that the human race was gaining another four years, another two, even another eight months in which to think it over, it would be worth it. It\u0027s wrong, but it may turn out right. I don\u0027t know. But I won\u0027t play\\n\\n Hamlet any longer. I know how dangerous Stillson is. Daddy, I love you very much. Believe it.\\n\\n Your Son,\\n\\n Johnny\\n\\n 8.\\n\\n Excerpt from testimony given before the socalled \u0027Stillson Committee\u0027, chaired by Senator William Cohen of Maine. The questioner is Mr. Albert Renfrew, the Committee\u0027s Deputy Counsel. The witness is Mr. Stuart Clawson, of the Blackstrap Road in Jackson, New Hampshire.\\n\\n Renfrew: And you say you just happened to grab your camera, Mr. Clawson?\\n\\n Clawson: Yeah! Just as I went out the door. I almost didn\u0027t even go that day, even though I like Greg Stillson - well, I did like him before all of this, anyway. The town hall just seemed like a bummer to me, you know?\u0027\\n\\n R: Because of your driver\u0027s exam.\\n\\n C: You got it. Flunking that permit test was one colossal bummer. But at the end, I said what the hell. And I got the picture. Wow! I got it. That picture\u0027s going to make me rich, I guess. Just like the flag-raising on Iwo Jima.\\n\\n R: I hope you don\u0027t get the idea that the entire thing was staged for your benefit, young man.\\n\\n C: Oh, no! Not at all! I only meant... well ... I don\u0027t know what I meant. But it happened right in front of me, and ... I don\u0027t know. Jeez, I was just glad I had my Nikon, that\u0027s all.\\n\\n R: You just snapped the photo when Stillson picked up the child?\\n\\n C: Matt Robeson, yessir.\\n\\n R: And this is a blowup of that photo?\\n\\n C: That\u0027s my picture, yes.\\n\\n R: And after you took it, what happened?\\n\\n C: Two of those goons ran after me. They were yelling \u0027Give us the camera, kid! Drop it.\u0027 Shi - uh, stuff like that.\\n\\n R: And you ran.\\n\\n C: Did I run? Holy God, I guess I ran. They chased me almost all the way to the town garage. One of them almost had me, but he slipped on the ice and fell down.\\n\\n Cohen: Young man, I\u0027d like to suggest that you won the most important footrace of your life when you outran those two thugs.\\n\\n C: Thank you, Sir. What Stillson did that day... maybe you had to be there, but ... holding a little kid in front of you, that\u0027s pretty low. I bet the people in New Hampshire wouldn\u0027t vote for that guy for dog-catcher. Not for...\\n\\n R: Thank you, Mr. Clawson. The witness is excused.\\n\\n 9.\\n\\n October again.\\n\\n Sarah had avoided this trip for a very long time, but now the time had come and it could be put off no longer. She felt that. She had left both children with Mrs. Ablanap - they had house-help now, and two cars instead of the little red Pinto; Walt\u0027s income was scraping near thirty thousand dollars a year - and had come by herself to Pownal through the burning blaze of late autumn.\\n\\n Now she pulled over on the shoulder of a pretty little country road, got out, and crossed to the small cemetery on the other side. A small, tarnished plaque on one of the stone posts announced that this was THE BIRCHES. It was enclosed by a rambling rock wall, and the grounds were neatly kept. A few faded flags remained from Memorial Day five months ago. Soon they would be buried under snow.\\n\\n She walked slowly, not hurrying, the breeze catching the hem of her dark green skirt and fluttering it. Here were generations of BOWDENS; here was a whole family of MARSTENS; here, grouped around a large marble memorial, were PILLSBURYS going back to 1750.\\n\\n And near the rear wall, she found a relatively new stone, which read simply JOHN SMITH. Sarah knelt\\n\\n beside it, hesitated, touched it. She let her fingertips skate thoughtfully over its polished surface.\\n\\n 10.\\n\\n Dear Sarah,\\n\\n January 23, 1979\\n\\n I\u0027ve just written my father a very important letter, and it took me nearly an hour and a half to work my way through it. I just don\u0027t have the energy to repeat the effort, so I am going to suggest that you call him as soon as you receive this, Go do it now, Sarah, before you read the rest of this.\\n\\n So now, in all probability, you know. I just wanted to tell you that I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about our date at the Esty Fair just recently. If I had to guess the two things that you remember most about it, I\u0027d guess the run of luck I had on the Wheel of Fortune (remember the kid who kept saying \u0027I love to see this guy take a beatin\u0027?), and the mask I wore to fool you. That was supposed to be a big joke, but you got mad and our date damn near went right down the drain. Maybe if it had, l wouldn\u0027t be here now and that taxi driver would still be alive. On the other hand, maybe nothing at all of importance changes in the future, and I would have been handed the same bullet to eat a week or a month or a year later.\\n\\n Well, we had our chance and it came up on one of the house numbers - double zero, I guess. But I wanted you to know that I think of you, Sarah. For me there really hasn\u0027t been anyone else, and that night was the best night for us...\\n\\n 11.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Johnny,\u0027 she murmured, and the wind walked softly through the trees that burned and blazed; a red leaf flipped its way across the bright blue sky and landed, unnoticed, in her hair. \u0027I\u0027m here. I finally came.\u0027\\n\\n Speaking out loud should have also seemed wrong, speaking to the dead in a graveyard was the act of a crazy person, she would have said once. But now emotion surprised her, emotion of such force and intensity that it caused her throat to ache and her hands to suddenly clap shut. It was all right to speak to him, maybe; after all, it had been nine years, and this was the end of it. After this there would be Walt and the children and lots of smiles from one of the chairs behind her husband\u0027s speaking podium; the endless smiles from the background and an occasional feature article in the Sunday supplements, if Walt\u0027s political career skyrocketed as he so calmly expected it to do. The future was a little more gray in her hair each year, never going braless because of the sag, becoming more careful about makeup; the future was exercise classes at the YWCA in Bangor and shopping and taking Denny to the first grade and Janis to nursery school; the future was New Year\u0027s Eve parties and funny hats as her life rolled into the science-fictiony decade of the 1980s and also into a queer and almost unsuspected state - middle age.\\n\\n She saw no county fairs in her future.\\n\\n The first slow, scalding tears began to come. \u0027Oh, Johnny,\u0027 she said. \u0027Everything was supposed to be different, wasn\u0027t it? It wasn\u0027t supposed to end like this.\u0027\\n\\n She lowered her head, her throat working painfully -and to no effect. The sobs came anyway, and the bright sunlight broke into prisms of light. The wind, which had seemed so warm and Indian summery, now seemed as chill as February on her wet cheeks.\\n\\n \u0027Not fair!\u0027 she cried into the silence of BOWDENS and MARSTENS and PILLSBURYS, that dead congregation of listeners who testified to nothing more or less than life is quick and dead is dead. \u0027Oh God, not fair!\u0027\\n\\n And that was when the hand touched her neck.\\n\\n 12.\\n\\n ... and that night was the best night for us, although there are still times when it\u0027s hard for me to believe there ever was such a year as 1970 and upheaval on the campuses and Nixon was president, no pocket calculators,\\n\\n no home video tape recorders, no Bruce Springsteen or punk-rock bands either. And at other times it seems like that time is only a handsbreadth away, that I can almost touch it, that if I could put my arms around you or touch your cheek or the back of your neck, I could carry you away with me into a different future with no pain or darkness or bitter choices.\\n\\n Well, we all do what we can, and it has to be good enough ... and if it isn\u0027t good enough, it has to do. I only hope that you will think of me as well as you can, dear Sarah. All my best,\\n\\n and all my love,\\n\\n Johnny\\n\\n 13.\\n\\n She drew her breath in raggedly, her back straightening, her eyes going wide and round. \u0027Johnny...?\u0027\\n\\n It was gone.\\n\\n Whatever it had been, it was gone. She stood and turned around and of course there was nothing there. But she could see him standing there, his hands jammed deep into his pockets, that easy, crooked grin on his pleasant-rather-than-handsome face, leaning lanky and at ease against a monument or one of the stone gateposts or maybe just a tree gone red with fall\u0027s dying fire. No big deal, Sarah - you still sniffin that wicked cocaine?\\n\\n Nothing there but Johnny; somewhere near, maybe everywhere.\\n\\n We all do what we can, and it has to be good enough ... and if it isn\u0027t good enough, it has to do. Nothing is ever lost, Sarah. Nothing that can\u0027t be found.\\n\\n \u0027Same old Johnny,\u0027 she whispered, and walked out of the cemetery and crossed the road. She paused for a moment, looking back. The warm October wind gusted strongly and great shades of light and shadow seemed to pass across the world. The trees rustled secretly.\\n\\n Sarah got in her car and drove away. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-28.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
