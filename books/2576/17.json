{"id":93661,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"1.\\n\\n The snow came early that year. There were six inches on the ground by November 7, and Johnny had taken to lacing on a pair of old green gumrubber boots and wearing his old parka for the trek up to the mailbox. Two weeks before, Dave Pelsen had mailed down a package containing the texts he would be using in January, and Johnny had already begun making tentative lesson plans. He was looking forward to getting back. Dave had also found him an apartment on Howland Street in Cleaves. 24 Howland Street. Johnny kept that on a scrap of paper in his wallet, because the name and number had an irritating way of slipping his mind.\\n\\n On this day the skies were slatey and lowering, the temperature hovering just below the twenty degree mark. As Johnny tramped up the driveway, the first spats of snow began to drift down. Because he was alone, he didn\u0027t feel too self conscious about running his tongue out and trying to catch a flake on it. He was hardly limping at all, and he felt good. There hadn\u0027t been a headache in two weeks or more.\\n\\n The mail consisted of an advertising circular, a Newsweek, and a small manila envelope addressed to John Smith, no return address. Johnny opened it on the way back, the rest of the mail stuffed into his hip pocket. He pulled out a single page of newsprint, saw the words Inside View at the top, and came to a halt halfway back to the house.\\n\\n It was page three of the previous week\u0027s issue. The headline story dealt with a reporter\u0027s \u0027expose\u0027 on the handsome second banana of a TV crime show; the second banana had been suspended from high school twice (twelve years ago) and busted for possession of cocaine (six years ago). Hot news for the hausfraus of America. There was also an all-grain diet, a cute baby photo, and a story of a nine-year-old girl who had been miraculously cured of cerebral palsy at Lourdes (DOCTORS MYSTIFIED, the headline trumpeted gleefully). A story near the bottom of the page had been circled. MAINE \u0027PSYCHIC\u0027 ADMITS HOAX, the headline read. The story was not by-lined.\\n\\n IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE POLICY of Inside View not only to bring you the fullest coverage of the psychics which the so-called \u0027National Press\u0027 ignores, but to expose the tricksters and charlatans who have held back true acceptance of legitimate psychic phenomena for so long.\\n\\n One of these tricksters admitted his own hoax to an Inside View source recently. This so called \u0027psychic\u0027, John Smith of Pownal, Maine, admitted to our source that \u0027it was all a gimmick to pay back my hospital bills. If there\u0027s a book in it, I might come out with enough to pay off what I owe and retire for a couple of years in the bargain,\u0027 Smith grinned. \u0027These days, people will believe anything - why shouldn\u0027t I get on the gravy train?\u0027\\n\\n Thanks to Inside View, which has always cautioned readers that there are two phony psychics for each real one, John Smith\u0027s gravy train has just been derailed. And we reiterate our standing offer of $1000 to anyone who can prove that any nationally known psychic is a fraud.\\n\\n Hoaxers and charlatans be warned!\\n\\n Johnny read the article twice as the snow began to come down more heavily. A reluctant grin broke over his features. The ever-vigilant press apparently didn\u0027t enjoy being thrown off some bumpkin\u0027s front porch, he thought. He tucked the tear sheet back into its envelope and stuffed it into his back pocket with the rest of the mail.\\n\\n \u0027Dees,\u0027 he said aloud, \u0027I hope you\u0027re still black and blue.\\n\\n 2.\\n\\n His father was not so amused. Herb read the clipping and then slammed it down on the kitchen table in disgust. \u0027You ought to sue that son of a whore. That\u0027s nothing but slander, Johnny. A deliberate hatchet job.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Agreed and agreed,\u0027 Johnny said. It was dark outside. This afternoon\u0027s silently falling snow had developed into tonight\u0027s early winter blizzard. The wind shrieked and howled around the eaves. The driveway had disappeared under a dunelike progression of drifts. \u0027But there was no third party when we talked, and Dees damn well knows it. It\u0027s his word against mine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He didn\u0027t even have the guts to put his own name to this lie,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Look at this \"an Inside View source\". What\u0027s this source? Get him to name it, that\u0027s what I say.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you can\u0027t do that,\u0027 Johnny said, grinning. \u0027That\u0027s like walking up to the meanest street-fighter on the block with a KICK ME HARD sign taped to your crotch. Then they turn it into a holy war, page one and all. No thanks. As far as I\u0027m concerned, they did me a favor. I don\u0027t want to make a career out of telling people where gramps hid his stock certificates or who\u0027s going to win the fourth at Scarborough Downs. Or take this lottery.\u0027 One of the things that had most surprised Johnny on coming out of his coma was to discover that Maine and about a dozen other states had instituted a legal numbers game. \u0027In the last month I\u0027ve gotten sixteen letters from people who want me to tell them what the number\u0027s going to be. It\u0027s insane. Even if I could tell them, which I couldn\u0027t, what good would it do them? You can\u0027t pick your own number in the Maine lottery, you get what they give you. But still I get the letters.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t see what that has to do with this crappy article.\\n\\n \u0027If people think I\u0027m a phony, maybe they\u0027ll leave me alone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Yeah, I see what you mean.\u0027 He lit his pipe. \u0027You\u0027ve never really been comfortable with it, have you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027We never talk much about it, either, which is something of a relief. It seems like the only thing other people do want to talk about.\u0027 And it wasn\u0027t just that they wanted to talk; that wouldn\u0027t have bothered him so much. But when he was in Slocum\u0027s Store for a sixpack or a loaf of bread, the girl would try to take his money without touching his hand, and the frightened, skittish look in her eyes was unmistakable. His father\u0027s friends would give him a little wave instead of a handshake. In October Herb had hired a local high school girl to come in once a week to do some dusting and vacuum the floors. After three weeks she had quit for no stated reason at all probably someone at her high school had told her who she was cleaning for. It seemed that for everyone who was anxious to be touched, to be informed, to be in contact with Johnny\u0027s peculiar talent, there was another who regarded him as a kind of leper. At times like these, Johnny would think of the nurses staring at him the day he had told Eileen Magown that her house was on fire, staring at him like magpies on a telephone wire. He would think of the way the TV reporter had drawn back from him after the press conference\u0027s unexpected conclusion, agreeing with everything he said but not wanting to be touched. Unhealthy either way.\\n\\n \u0027No, we don\u0027t talk about it,\u0027 Herb agreed. \u0027It makes me think of your mother, I suppose. She was so sure you\u0027d been given the ... the whatever-it-is for some reason. Sometimes I wonder if she wasn\u0027t right.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny shrugged. \u0027All I want is a normal life. I want to bury the whole damn thing. And if this little squib helps me do it, so much the better.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you still can do it, can\u0027t you?\u0027 Herb asked. He was looking closely at his son.\\n\\n Johnny thought about a night not quite a week ago. They had gone out to dinner, a rare happening on their strapped budget. They had gone to Cole\u0027s Farm in Gray, probably the best restaurant in the area, a place that was always packed. The night had been cold, the dining room cheery and warm. Johnny had taken his father\u0027s coat and his own into the cloakroom, and as he thumbed through the racked coats, looking for empty hangers, a whole series of clear impressions had cascaded through his mind. It was like that sometimes, and on another occasion he could have handled every coat for twenty minutes and gotten nothing at all. Here was a lady\u0027s coat with a fur collar. She was having an affair with one of her husband\u0027s poker buddies, was scared sick about it, but didn\u0027t know how to close it off. A man\u0027s denim jacket, sheepskin-lined. This guy was also worried - about his brother, who had been badly hurt on a construction project the week before. A small boy\u0027s parka - his grandmother in Durham had given him a Snoopy transistor radio just today and he was mad because his father hadn\u0027t let him bring it into the dining room with him. And another one, a plain, black topcoat, that had turned him cold with terror and robbed him of his appetite. The man who owned this coat was going mad. So far he had kept up appearances - not even his wife suspected - but his vision of the world was being slowly darkened by a series of increasingly paranoid fantasies. Touching that\\n\\n Coat had been like touching a writhing coil of snakes.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I can still do it,\u0027 Johnny said briefly. \u0027I wish to hell I couldn\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You really mean that?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny thought of the plain, black topcoat. He had only picked at his meal, looking this way and that, trying to single the man out of the crowd, unable to do so.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I mean it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Best forgotten then,\u0027 Herb said, and clapped his son on the shoulder.\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n And for the next month or so it seemed that it would be forgotten. Johnny drove north to attend a meeting at the high school for midyear teachers and to take a load of his personal things up to his new apartment, which he found small but liveable.\\n\\n He went in his father\u0027s car, and as he was getting ready to leave Herb asked him, \u0027You\u0027re not nervous? About driving?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny shook his head. Thoughts of the accident itself troubled him very little now. If something was going to happen to him, it would. And deep down he felt confident that lightning would not strike in the same place again - when he died, he didn\u0027t believe it would be in a car accident.\\n\\n In fact, the long trip was quiet and soothing, the meeting a little bit like Old Home Week. All of his old colleagues who were still teaching at CMHS dropped by to wish him the best. But he couldn\u0027t help noticing how few of them actually shook hands with him, and he seemed to sense a certain reserve, a wariness in their eyes. Drivmg home, he convinced himself it was probably imagination. And if not, well - even that had its amusing side. If they had read their Inside View, they would know he was a hoax and nothing to worry about.\\n\\n The meeting over, there was nothing to do but go back to Pownal and wait for the Christmas holidays to come and go. The packages containing personal objects stopped coming, almost as if a switch had been thrown - the power of the press, Johnny told his father. They were replaced by a brief spate of angry - and mostly anonymous - letters and cards from people who seemed to feel personally cheated.\\n\\n \u0027You ort to burn in H! E! L! L! for your slimey skeems to bilk this American Republic,\u0027 a typical one read. It had been written on a crumpled sheet of Ramada Inn stationery and was postmarked York, Pennsylvania. \u0027You are nothing but a Con Artist and a dirty rotten cheet. I bless God for that paper that saw thru you. You Ort to be ashamed of yourself Sir. The Bible says an ordinery sinner will be cast into the Lake of F!I!R!E! and be consomed but a F!A!L!S!E P!R!O!F!I!T! shall burn forever and EVER! That\u0027s you a False Profit who sold your Immortal Soul for a few cheep bucks. So thats the end of my letter and I hope for your sake I never catch you ut on the Streets of your Home Town. Signed, A FRIEND (of God not you Sir)!\u0027\\n\\n Over two dozen letters in this approximate vein came in during the course of about twenty days following the appearance of the inside View story. Several enterprising souls expressed an interest in joining in with Johnny as partners. \u0027I used to be a magician\u0027s assistant,\u0027 one of these latter missives bragged, \u0027and I could trick an old whore out of her g-string. If you\u0027re planning a mentalist gig, you need me in!\u0027\\n\\n Then the letters dried up, as had the earlier influx of boxes and packages. On a day in late November when he had checked the mailbox and found it empty for the third afternoon in a row, Johnny walked back to the house remembering that Andy Warhol had predicted that a day would come when everyone in America would be famous for fifteen minutes. Apparently his fifteen minutes had come and gone, and no one was any more pleased about it than he was.\\n\\n But as things turned out, it wasn\u0027t over yet.\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n \u0027Smith?\u0027 The telephone voice asked. \u0027John Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 It wasn\u0027t a voice he knew, or a wrong number. That made it something of a puzzle since his father had had the phone unlisted about three months ago. This was December 17, and their tree stood in the corner of the living room, its base firmly wedged into the old tree stand Herb had made when Johnny was just a kid. Outside it was snowing.\\n\\n \u0027My name is Bannerman. Sheriff George Bannerman, from Castle Rock.\u0027 He cleared his throat. \u0027I\u0027ve got a well, I suppose you\u0027d say I\u0027ve got a proposal for you.\\n\\n \u0027How did you get this number?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman cleared his throat again. \u0027Well, I could have gotten it from the phone company, I suppose, it being police business. But actually I got it from a friend of yours. Doctor by the name of Weizak.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sam Weizak gave you my number?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny sat down in the phone nook, utterly perplexed. Now the name Bannerman meant something to him. He had come across the name in a Sunday supplement article only recently. He was the sheriff of Castle County, which was considerably west of Pownal, in the Lakes region. Castle Rock was the county seat, about thirty miles from Norway and twenty from Bridgton.\\n\\n \u0027Police business?\u0027 he repeated.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I guess you\u0027d say so, ayuh. I was wondering if maybe the two of us could get together for a cup of coffee\\n\\n \u0027It involves Sam?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Dr. Weizak has nothing to do with it,\u0027 Banner-man said. \u0027He gave me a call and mentioned your name. That was,.. oh, a month ago, at least. To be frank, I thought he was nuts. But now we\u0027re just about at our wits\u0027 end.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027About what? Mr. - Sheriff - Bannerman, I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027d really be a lot better if we could get together for coffee,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Maybe this evening? There\u0027s a place called Jon\u0027s on the main drag in Bridgton. Sort of halfway between your town and mine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027d have to know what it was about. And how come Sam never called me?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman sighed. I guess you\u0027re a man who doesn\u0027t read the papers,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n But that wasn\u0027t true. He had read the papers compulsively since he had regained consciousness, trying to pick up on the things he had missed. And he had seen Bannerman\u0027s name just recently. Sure. Because Bannerman was on a pretty hot seat. He was the man in charge of-Johnny held the phone away from his ear and looked at it with sudden understanding. He looked at it the way a man might look at a snake he has just realized is poisonous.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith?\u0027 It squawked tinnily. \u0027Hello, Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m here,\u0027 Johnny said putting the phone back to his ear. He was conscious of a dull anger at Sam Weizak, Sam who had told him to keep his head down only this summer, and then had turned around and given this local-yokel sheriff an earful - behind Johnny\u0027s back.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s that strangling business, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman hesitated a long time. Then he said, \u0027Could we talk, Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Absolutely not.\u0027 The dull anger had ignited into sudden fury. Fury and something else. He was scared.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith, it\u0027s important. Today...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I want to be left alone. Besides, don\u0027t you read the goddam inside View? I\u0027m a fake anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dr. Weizak said...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He had no business saying anything! \u0027Johnny shouted. He was shaking all over. \u0027Good-bye!\u0027 He slammed the phone into its cradle and got out of the phone nook quickly, as if that would prevent it from ringing again. He could feel a headache beginning in his temples. Dull drill-bits. Maybe I should call his mother out there in California, he thought. Tell her where her little sonny-buns is. Tell her to get in touch. Tit for tat.\\n\\n Instead he hunted in the address book in the phone-table drawer, found Sam\u0027s office number in Bangor, and called it. As soon as it rang once on the other end he hung up, scared again. Why had Sam done that to him? Goddammit, why?\\n\\n He found himself looking at the Christmas tree.\\n\\n Same old decorations. They had dragged them down from the attic again and taken them out of their tissue-paper cradles again and hung them up again, just two evenings ago. It was a funny thing about Christmas decorations. There weren\u0027t many things that remained intact year after year as a person grew up. Not many lines of continuity, not many physical objects that could easily serve both the states of childhood and adulthood. Your kid clothes were handed down or packed off to the Salvation Army; your Donald Duck watch sprung its mainspring; your Red Ryder cowboy boots wore out. The wallet you made in your first camp handicrafts class got replaced by a Lord Buxton, and you traded your red wagon and your bike for more adult toys - a car, a tennis racket, maybe one of those new TV hockey games. There were only a few things you could hang onto. A few books, maybe, or a lucky coin, or a stamp collection that had been preserved and improved upon.\\n\\n Add to that the Christmas tree ornaments in your parents\u0027 house.\\n\\n The same chipped angels year after year, and the same tinsel star on top; the tough surviving platoon of what had once been an entire battalion of glass balls (and we never forget the honored dead, he thought - this one died as a result of a baby\u0027s clutching hand, this one slipped as dad was putting it on and crashed to the floor, the red one with the Star of Bethlehem painted on it was simply and mysteriously broken one year when we took them down from the attic, and I cried); the tree stand itself. But sometimes, Johnny thought, absently massaging his temples, it seemed it would be better, more merciful, if you lost touch with even these last vestiges of childhood. You could never discover the books that had first turned you on in quite the same way. The lucky coin had not protected you from any of the ordinary whips and scorns and scrapes of an ordinary life. And when you looked at the ornaments you remembered that there had once been a mother in the place to direct the tree-trimming operation, always ready and willing to piss you off by saying \u0027a little higher\u0027 or \u0027a little lower\u0027 or \u0027I think you\u0027ve got too much tinsel on that left side, dear.\u0027 You looked at the ornaments and remembered that just the two of you had been around to put them up this year, just the two of you because your mother went crazy and then she died, but the fragile Christmas tree ornaments were still here, still hanging around to decorate another tree taken from the small back woodlot and didn\u0027t they say more people committed suicide around Christmas than at any other time of the year? By God, it was no wonder.\\n\\n What a power God has given you, Johnny.\\n\\n Sure, that\u0027s right, God\u0027s a real prince. He knocked me through the windshield of a cab and I broke my legs and spent five years or so in a coma and three people died. The girl I loved got married. She had the son who should have been mine by a lawyer who\u0027s breaking his ass to get to Washington so he can help run the big electric train set. If I\u0027m on my feet for more than a couple of hours at a time it feels like somebody took a long splinter and rammed it straight up my leg to my balls. God\u0027s a real sport. He\u0027s such a sport that he fixed up a funny comic-opera world where a bunch of glass Christmas tree globes could outlive you. Neat world, and a really first-class God in charge of it. He must have been on our side during Vietnam, because that\u0027s the way he\u0027s been running things ever since time began.\\n\\n He has a job for you, Johnny.\\n\\n Bailing some half-assed country cop out of a jam so he can get re-elected next year.\\n\\n Don\u0027t run from him, Johnny. Don\u0027t hide away in a cave.\\n\\n He rubbed his temples. Outside, the wind was rising. He hoped dad would be careful coming home from work.\\n\\n Johnny got up and pulled on a heavy sweatshirt. He went out into the shed, watching his breath frost the air ahead of him. To the left was a large pile of wood he had split in the autumn just past, all of it cut into neat Stove lengths. Next to it was a box of kindling, and be-side that was a stack of old newspapers. He squatted down and began to thumb through them. His hands went numb quickly but he kept going, and eventually he came to the one he was looking for. The Sunday paper from three weeks ago.\\n\\n He took it into the house, slapped it down on the kitchen table, and began to root through it. He found the article he was looking for in the features section and sat down to reread it.\\n\\n The article was accompanied by several photos, one of them showing an old woman locking a door, another showing a police car cruising a nearly deserted street, two others showing a couple of businesses that were nearly deserted. The headline read: THE HUNT FOR THE CASTLE ROCK STRANGLER GOES ON ... AND\\n\\n ON.\\n\\n Five years ago, according to the story, a young woman named Alma Frechette who worked at a local restaurant had been raped and strangled on her way home from work. A joint investigation of the crime had been conducted by the state attorney general\u0027s office and the Castle County sheriff\u0027s department. The result had been a total zero. A year later an elderly woman, also raped and strangled, had been discovered in her tiny third-floor apartment on Carbine Street in Castle Rock. A month later the killer had struck again; this time the victim had been a bright young junior high school girl.\\n\\n There had been a more intensive investigation. The investigative facilities of the FBI had been utilized, all to no result. The following November Sheriff Carl M. Kelso, who had been the county\u0027s chief law officer since approximately the days of the Civil War, had been voted out and George Bannerman had been voted in, largely on an aggressive campaign to catch the \u0027Castle Rock Strangler\u0027.\\n\\n Two years passed. The strangler had not been apprehended, but no further murders occurred, either. Then, last January, the body of seventeen-year-old Carol Dunbarger had been found by two small boys. The Dunbarger girl had been reported as a missing person by her parents. She had been in and out of trouble at Castle Rock High School where she had a record of chronic tardiness and truancy, she had been busted twice for shop-lifting, and had run away once before, getting as far as Boston. Both Bannerman and the state police assumed she had been thumbing a ride - and the killer had picked her up. A midwinter thaw had uncovered her body near Strimmer\u0027s Brook, where two small boys had found it. The state medical examiner said she had been dead about two months.\\n\\n Then, this November 2, there had been yet another murder. The victim was a well-liked Castle Rock grammar school teacher named Etta Ringgold. She was a lifetime member of the local Methodist church, holder of an M.B.S. in elementary education, and prominent in local charities. She had been fond of the works of Robert Browning, and her body had been found stuffed into a culvert that ran beneath an unpaved secondary road. The uproar over the murder of Miss Ringgold had rumbled over all of northern New England. Comparisons to Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, were made -comparisons that did nothing to pour oil on the troubled waters. William Loeb\u0027s Union-Leader in not-so distant Manchester, New Hampshire, had published a helpful editorial titled THE DO-NOTHING COPS IN OUR SISTER STATE.\\n\\n This Sunday supplement article, now nearly six weeks old and smelling pungently of shed and woodbox, quoted two local psychiatrists who had been perfectly happy to blue-sky the situation as long as their names weren\u0027t printed. One of them mentioned a particular sexual aberration - the urge to commit some violent act at the moment of orgasm. Nice, Johnny thought, grimacing. He strangled them to death as he came. His headache was getting worse all the time.\\n\\n The other shrink pointed out the fact that all five murders had been committed in late fall or early winter. And while the manic-depressive personality didn\u0027t con-form to any one set pattern, it was fairly common for such a person to have mood-swings closely paralleling the change of the seasons. He might have a \u0027low\u0027 lasting from mid-April until about the end of August and then begin to climb, \u0027peaking\u0027 at around the time of the murders.\\n\\n During the manic or \u0027up\u0027 state, the person in question was apt to be highly sexed, active, daring, and optimistic. \u0027He would be likely to believe the police unable to catch him,\u0027 the unnamed psychiatrist had finished. The article concluded by saying that, so far, the person in question had been right.\\n\\n Johnny put the paper down, glanced at the clock, and saw his father should be home almost anytime, unless the snow was holding him up. He took the old newspaper over to the wood stove and poked it into the firebox.\\n\\n Not my business. Goddam Sam Weizak anyway.\\n\\n Don\u0027t hide away in a cave, Johnny.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t hiding away in a cave, that wasn\u0027t it at all. It just so happened that he\u0027d had a fairly tough break. Losing a big chunk of your life, that qualified you for tough-break status, didn\u0027t it?\\n\\n And all the self-pity you can guzzle?\\n\\n \u0027Fuck you,\u0027 he muttered to himself. He went to the window and looked out. Nothing to see but snow falling in heavy, wind-driven lines. He hoped dad was being careful, but he also hoped his father would show up soon and put an end to this useless rat-run of introspection. He went over to the telephone again and stood there, undecided.\\n\\n Self-pity or not, he had lost a goodish chunk of his life. His prime, if you wanted to put it that way. He had worked hard to get back. Didn\u0027t he deserve some ordinary privacy? Didn\u0027t he have a right to what he had just been thinking of a few minutes ago - an ordinary life?\\n\\n There is no such thing, my man.\\n\\n Maybe not, but there was such a thing as an abnormal life. That thing at Cole\u0027s Farm. Feeling people\u0027s clothes and suddenly knowing their little dreads, small secrets, petty triumphs - that was abnormal. It wasn\u0027t a talent, it was a curse.\\n\\n Suppose he did meet this sheriff? There was no guarantee he could tell him a thing. And suppose he could? Just suppose he could hand him his killer on a silver platter? It would be the hospital press conference all over again, a three-ring circus raised to the grisly nth power.\\n\\n A little song began to run maddeningly through his aching head, little more than a jingle, really. A Sunday. school song from his early childhood: This little light of mine ...I\u0027m gonna let it shine ... this little light of mine ... I\u0027m gonna let it shine ... let it shine, shine, shine, let it shine...\\n\\n He picked up the phone and dialed Weizak\u0027s office number. Safe enough now, after five. Weizak would have gone home, and big-deal neurologists don\u0027t list their home phones. The phone rang six or seven times and Johnny was going to put it down when it was answered and Sam himself said, \u0027Hi? Hello?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sam?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027John Smith?\u0027 The pleasure in Sam\u0027s voice was Unmistakable - but was there also an undercurrent of unease in it.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, it\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you like this snow?\u0027 Weizak said, maybe a little heartily. \u0027Is it snowing where you are?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s snowing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just started here about an hour ago. They say John? Is it the sheriff? Is that why you sound so cold?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, he called me,\u0027 Johnny said, \u0027and I\u0027ve been sort of wondering what happened. Why you gave him my name?\\n\\n Why you didn\u0027t call me and say you had... and why you didn\u0027t call me first and ask if you could.\u0027\\n\\n Weizak sighed. \u0027Johnny, I could maybe give you a lie, but that would be no good. I didn\u0027t ask you first because I was afraid you would say no. And I didn\u0027t tell you I\u0027d done it afterward because the sheriff laughed at me. When someone laughs at one of my suggestions, I assume, nub, that the suggestion is not going to be taken.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny rubbed at one aching temple with his free hand and closed his eyes. \u0027But why, Sam? You know how I feel about that. You were the one who told me to keep my head down and let it blow over. You told me that yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the piece in the paper,\u0027 Sam said. \u0027I said to myself, Johnny lives down that way. And I said to myself, five dead women. Five.\u0027 His voice was slow, halting, and embarrassed. It made Johnny feel much worse to hear Sam sounding like this. He wished he hadn\u0027t called.\\n\\n \u0027Two of them teenage girls. A young mother. A teacher of young children who loved Browning. All of it so corny, nuh? So corny I suppose they would never make a movie or a TV show out of it. But nonetheless true. It was the teacher I thought about most. Stuffed into a culvert like a bag of garbage...\\n\\n \u0027You had no damn right to bring me into your guilt fantasies,\u0027 Johnny said thickly.\\n\\n \u0027No, perhaps not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No perhaps about it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Johnny, are you all right? You sound...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine! \u0027 Johnny shouted.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t sound fine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got a shitter of a headache, is that so surprising? I wish to Christ you\u0027d left this alone. When I told you about your mother you didn\u0027t call her. Because you said...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said some things are better lost than found. But that is not always true, Johnny. This man, whoever he is, has a terribly disturbed personality. He may kill himself. I am sure that when he stopped for two years the police thought he had. But a manicdepressive sometimes has long level periods - it is called a \"plateau of normality\" -and then goes back to the same mood-swings. He may have killed himself after murdering that teacher last month. But if he hasn\u0027t, what then? He may kill another one. Or two. Or four. Or...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stop it.\u0027\\n\\n Sam said, \u0027Why did Sheriff Bannerman call you? What made him change his mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I suppose the voters are after him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry I called him, Johnny, and that this has u~ set you so. But even more I am sorry that I did not call you and tell you what I had done. I was wrong. God knows you have a right to live your life quietly.\u0027\\n\\n Hearing his own thoughts echoed did not make him feel better. Instead he felt more miserable and guilty than ever.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s okay, Sam.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll not say anything to anyone again. I suppose that is like putting a new lock on the barn door after a horse theft, but it\u0027s all I can say. I was indiscreet. In a doctor, that\u0027s bad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Johnny said again. He felt helpless, and the slow embarrassment with which Sam spoke made it worse.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll see you soon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be up in Cleaves next month to start teaching. I\u0027ll drop by.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Again, my sincere apologies, John.\u0027\\n\\n Stop saying that!\\n\\n They said their good-byes and Johnny hung up, wishing he hadn\u0027t called at all. Maybe he hadn\u0027t wanted Sam to agree so readily that what he had done was wrong. Maybe what he had really wanted Sam to say was, Sure l called him. I wanted you to get off your ass and do something.\\n\\n He wandered across to the window and looked out into the blowing darkness. Stuffed into a culvert like a bag of garbage\\n\\n God, how his head ached.\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n Herb got home half an hour later, took one look at Johnny\u0027s white face and said, \u0027Headache?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not too bad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We want to watch the national news,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Glad I got home in time. Bunch of people from NBC were over in Castle Rock this afternoon, filming. That lady reporter you think is so pretty was there. Cassie Mackin.\u0027\\n\\n He blinked at the way Johnny turned on him. For a moment it seemed that Johnny\u0027s face was all eyes, staring out at him and full of a nearly inhuman pain.\\n\\n \u0027Castle Rock? Another murder?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah. They found a little girl on the town common this morning. Saddest damn thing you ever heard of. I guess she had a pass to go across the common to the library for some project she was working on. She got to the library but she never got back ... Johnny, you look terrible, boy.\\n\\n \u0027How old was she?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just nine,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027A man who\u0027d do a thing like that should be strung up by the balls. That\u0027s my view on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nine,\u0027 Johnny said, and sat down heavily. \u0027Stone the crows.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny, you sure you feel okay? You\u0027re white as paper.\\n\\n \u0027Fine. Turn on the news.\u0027\\n\\n Shortly, John Chancellor was in front of them, bearing his nightly satchel of political aspirations (Fred Harris\u0027s campaign was not catching much fire), government edicts (the cities of America would just have to learn common budgetary sense, according to President Ford), international incidents (a nationwide strike in France), the Dow Jones (up), and a \u0027heartwarming\u0027 piece about a boy with cerebral palsy who was raising a 4-H cow.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe they cut it,\u0027 Herb said.\\n\\n But after a commercial, Chancellor said: \u0027In western Maine, there\u0027s a townful of frightened, angry people tonight. The town is Castle Rock, and over the last five years there have been five nasty murders - five women ranging in age from seventy-one to fourteen have been raped and strangled. Today there was a sixth murder in Castle Rock, and the victim was a nine-year-old girl. Catherine Mackin is in Castle Rock with the story.\u0027\\n\\n And there she was, looking like a figment of make-believe carefully superimposed on a real setting. She was standing across from the Town Office Building. The first of that afternoon\u0027s snow which had developed into tonight\u0027s blizzard was powdering the shoulders of her coat and her blonde hair.\\n\\n \u0027A sense of quietly mounting hysteria lies over this small New England mill town this afternoon,\u0027 she began. \u0027The townspeople of Castle Rock have been nervous for a long time over the unknown person the local press calls \"the Castle Rock Strangler\" or sometimes \"the November Killer\". That nervousness has changed to terror - no one here thinks that word is too strong - following the discovery of Mary Kate Hendrasen\u0027s body on the town common, not far from the bandstand where the body of the November Killer\u0027s first victim, a waitress named Alma Frechette, was discovered.\u0027\\n\\n A long panning shot of the town common, looking bleak and dead in the falling snow. This was replaced with a school photograph of Mary Kate Hendrasen, grinning brashly through a heavy set of braces. Her hair was a fine white-blonde. Her dress was an electric blue. Most likely her best dress, Johnny thought sickly. Her mother put her into her best dress for her school photo.\\n\\n The report went on - now they were recapitulating the past murders - but Johnny was on the phone, first to directory assistance and then to the Castle Rock town offices. He dialed slowly, his head thudding.\\n\\n Herb came out of the living room and looked at him curiously. \u0027Who are you calling, son?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny shook his head and listened to the phone ring on the other end. It was picked up. \u0027Castle County sheriff\u0027s office.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d like to talk to Sheriff Bannerman, please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could I have your name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027John Smith, from Pownal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hold on, please.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny turned to look at the TV and saw Bannerman as he had been that afternoon, bundled up in a heavy parka with county sheriff patches on the shoulders. He looked uncomfortable and dogged as he fielded the reporters\u0027 questions. He was a broad-shouldered man with a big, sloping head capped with curly dark hair. The rimless glasses he wore looked strangely out of place, as spectacles always seem to look out of place on very big men.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re following up a number of leads,\u0027 Bannerman said.\\n\\n \u0027Hello? Mr. Smith?\u0027 Bannerman said.\\n\\n Again that queer sense of doubling. Bannerman was in two places at one time. Two times at one time, if you wanted to look at it that way. Johnny felt an instant of helpless vertigo. He felt the way, God help him, you felt on one of those cheap carnival rides, the Tilt-A-Whirl or the Crack-The-Whip.\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith? Are you there, man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I\u0027m here.\u0027 He swallowed. \u0027I\u0027ve changed my mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good boy! I\u0027m damned glad to hear it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I still may not be able to help you, you know.\\n\\n \u0027I know that. But ... no venture, no gain.\u0027 Bannerman cleared his throat. \u0027They\u0027d run me out of this town on a rail if they knew I was down to consulting a psychic.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s face was touched with a ghost of a grin. \u0027And a discredited psychic, at that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you know where Jon\u0027s in Bridgton is?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can find it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you meet me there at eight o\u0027clock?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I think so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you, Mr. Smith.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027\\n\\n He hung up. Herb was watching him closely. Behind him, the \u0027Nightly News\u0027 credits were rolling.\\n\\n \u0027He called you earlier, huh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, he did. Sam Weizak told him I might be able to help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think you can?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said, \u0027but my headache feels a little better.\u0027\\n\\n 6.\\n\\n He was fifteen minutes late getting to Jon\u0027s Restaurant in Bridgton; it seemed to be the only business establishment on Bridgton\u0027s main drag that was still open. The plows were falling behind the snow, and there were drifts across the road in several places. At the junction of Routes 3O2 and 117, the blinker light swayed back and forth in the screaming wind. A police cruiser with CASTLE COUNTY SHERIFF in gold leaf on the door was parked in front of Jon\u0027s. He parked behind it and went inside.\\n\\n Bannerman was sitting at a table in front of a cup of coffee and a bowl of chili. The TV had misled. He wasn\u0027t a big man; he was a huge man. Johnny walked over and introduced himself.\\n\\n Bannerman stood up and shook the offered hand. Looking at Johnny\u0027s white, strained face and the way his thin body seemed to float inside his Navy pea jacket, Bannerman\u0027s first thought was: This guy is sick - he\u0027s maybe not going to live too long. Only Johnny\u0027s eyes seemed to have any real life - they were a direct, piercing blue, and they fixed firmly on Bannerman\u0027s own with sharp, honest curiosity. And when their hands clasped, Bannerman felt a peculiar kind of surprise, a sensation he would later describe as a draining. It was a little like getting a shock from a bare electrical wire. Then it was gone.\\n\\n \u0027Glad you could come,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Coffee?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How about a bowl of chili? They make a great damn chili here. I\u0027m not supposed to eat it because of my ulcer, but I do anyway.\u0027 He saw the look of surprise on Johnny\u0027s face and smiled. \u0027I know, it doesn\u0027t seem right, a great big guy like me having an ulcer, does it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess anyone can get one.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re damn tooting,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027What changed your mind?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the news. The little girl. Are you sure it was the same guy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was the same guy. Same M.O. And the same sperm type.\\n\\n He watched Johnny\u0027s face as the waitress came over. \u0027Coffee?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Tea,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027And bring him a bowl of chili, Miss,\u0027 Bannerman said. When the waitress had gone he said, \u0027This doctor, he says that if you touch something, sometimes you get ideas about where it came from, who might have owned it, that sort of thing.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny smiled. \u0027Well,\u0027 he said, \u0027I just shook your hand and I know you\u0027ve got an Irish setter named Rusty. And I know he\u0027s old and going blind and you think it\u0027s time he was put to sleep, but you don\u0027t know how you\u0027d explain it to your girl.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman dropped his spoon back into his chili -plop. He stared at Johnny with his mouth open. \u0027By God,\u0027 he said. \u0027You got that from me? Just now?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny nodded.\\n\\n Bannerman shook his head and muttered, \u0027It\u0027s one thing to hear something like that and another to ... doesn\u0027t it tire you out?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny looked at Bannerman, surprised. It was a question he had never been asked before. \u0027Yes. Yes, it does.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you knew. I\u0027ll be damned.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But look, Sheriff.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027George. Just plain George.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027m Johnny, just plain Johnny. George, what I don\u0027t know about you would fill about five books. I don\u0027t know where you grew up or where you went to police school or who your friends are or where you live. I know you\u0027ve got a little girl, and her name\u0027s something like Cathy, but that\u0027s not quite it I. don\u0027t know what you; did last week or what beer you favor or what your favorite TV program is.\\n\\n \u0027My daughter\u0027s name is Katrina,\u0027 Bannerman said softly. \u0027She\u0027s nine, too. She was in Mary Kate\u0027s class.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What I\u0027m trying to say is that the ... the knowing is sometimes a pretty limited thing. Because of the dead zone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dead zone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like some of the signals don\u0027t conduct,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I can never get streets or addresses. Numbers are hard but they sometimes come.\u0027 The waitress returned with Johnny\u0027s tea and chili. He tasted the chili and nodded at Bannerman. \u0027You\u0027re right. It\u0027s good. Especially on a night like this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go to it,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Man, I love good chili. My ulcer hollers bloody hell about it. Fuck you, ulcer, I say. Down the hatch.\u0027\\n\\n They were quiet for a moment. Johnny worked on his chili and Bannerman watched him curiously. He sup-posed Smith could have found out he had a dog named Rusty. He even could have found out that Rusty was old and nearly blind. Take it a step farther: if he knew Katrina\u0027s name, he might have done that \u0027something like Cathy but that\u0027s not quite it\u0027 routine just to add the right touch of hesitant realism. But why? And none of that explained that queer, zapped feeling he\u0027d gotten in his head when Smith touched his hand. If it was a con, it was a damned good one.\\n\\n Outside, the wind gusted to a low shriek that seemed to rock the small building on its foundations. A flying veil of snow lashed the Pondicherry Bowling Lanes across the street.\\n\\n \u0027Listen to that,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Supposed to keep up all night. Don\u0027t tell me the winters\u0027re getting milder.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Have you got something?\u0027 Johnny asked. \u0027Something that belonged to the guy you\u0027re looking for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We think we might,\u0027 Bannerman said, and then shook his head. \u0027But it\u0027s pretty thin,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman laid it out for him. The grammar school and the library sat facing each other across the town common. It was standard operating procedure to send students across when they needed a book for a project or a report. The teacher gave them a pass and the librarian initialed it before sending them back. Near the center of the common, the land dipped slightly. On the west side of the dip was the town bandstand. In the dip itself were two dozen benches where people sat during band concerts and football rallies in the fall.\\n\\n \u0027We think he just sat himself down and waited for a kid to come along. He would have been out of sight from both sides of the common. But the footpath runs along the north side of the dip, close to those benches.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman shook his head slowly.\\n\\n \u0027What makes it worse is that the Frechette woman was killed right on the bandstand. I am going to face a shit-storm about that at town meeting in March - that is, if I\u0027m still around in March. Well, I can show them a memo I wrote to the town manager, requesting adult crossing guards on the common during school hours. Not that it was this killer that I was worried about, Christ, no. Never in my wildest dreams did I think he\u0027d go back to the same spot a second time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The town manager turned down the crossing guards?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not enough money,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Of course, he can spread the blame around to the town selectmen, and they\u0027ll try to spread it back on me, and the grass will grow on Mary Kate Hendrasen\u0027s grave and ...\u0027 He paused for a moment, or perhaps choked on what he was saying. Johnny gazed at his lowered head sympathetically.\\n\\n \u0027It might not have made any difference anyhow,\u0027 Bannerman went on in a dryer voice. \u0027Most of the crossing guards we use are women, and this fuck we\u0027re after doesn\u0027t seem to care how old or young they are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you think he waited on one of those benches?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman did. They had found an even dozen fresh cigarette butts near the end of one of the benches, and four more behind the bandstand itself, along with an empty box. Marlboros, unfortunately - the second or third most popular brand in the country. The cellophane on the box had been dusted for prints and had yielded none at all.\\n\\n \u0027None at all?\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027That\u0027s a little funny, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you say so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, you\u0027d guess the killer was wearing gloves even if he wasn\u0027t thinking about prints - it was cold out -, but you\u0027d think the guy that sold him the cigarettes ...\\n\\n Bannerman grinned. \u0027You\u0027ve got a head for this work,\u0027 he said, \u0027but you\u0027re not a smoker.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I used to smoke a few cigarettes when I was in college, but I lost the habit after my accident.\\n\\n \u0027A man keeps his cigarettes in his breast pocket. Take them out, get a cigarette, put the pack back. If you\u0027re wearing gloves and not leaving fresh prints every time you get a butt, what you\u0027re doing is polishing that cellophane wrapper? Get it? And you missed one other thing, Johnny. Need me to tell you?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny thought it over and then said, \u0027Maybe the pack of cigarettes came out of a carton. And those cartons are packed by machine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s it,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027You are good at this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about the tax stamp on the package?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maine,\u0027 Bannerman said.\\n\\n \u0027So if the killer and the smoker were the same man... Johnny said thoughtfully.\\n\\n Bannerman shrugged. \u0027Sure, there\u0027s the technical possibility that they weren\u0027t. But I\u0027ve tried to imagine who else would want to sit on a bench in the town common on a cold, cloudy winter morning long enough to smoke twelve or sixteen cigarettes, and I come up a blank.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny sipped his tea. \u0027None of the other kids that crossed saw anything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027I\u0027ve talked to every kid that had a library pass this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s a lot weirder than the fingerprint business. Doesn\u0027t it strike you that way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It strikes me as goddam scary. Look, the guy is sitting there, and what he\u0027s waiting for is one kid one girl - by herself. He can hear the kids as they come along. And each time he fades back behind the bandstand...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tracks,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027Not this morning. There was no snow-cover this morning. Just frozen ground. So here\u0027s this crazy shitbag that ought to have his own testicles carved off and served to him for dinner, here he is, skulking behind the bandstand. At about 8: 50 A.M., Peter Harrington and Melissa Loggins come along. School has been in session about twenty minutes at that time. When they\u0027re gone, he goes back to his bench. At 9: i5 he fades back behind the bandstand again. This time it\u0027s two little girls, Susan Flarhaty and Katrina Bannerman.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny set his mug down with a bang. Bannerman had taken off his spectacles and was polishing them savagely.\\n\\n \u0027Your daughter crossed this morning? Jesus!\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman put his glasses on again. His face was dark and dull with fury. And he\u0027s afraid, Johnny saw. Not afraid that the voters would turn him out, or that the Union-Leader would publish another editorial about nitwit cops in western Maine, but afraid because, if his daughter had happened to go to the library alone this morning\\n\\n \u0027My daughter,\u0027 Bannerman agreed softly. \u0027I think she passed within forty feet of that ... that animal. You know what that makes me feel like?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can guess,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think you can. It makes me feel like I almost stepped into an empty elevator shaft. Like I passed up the mushrooms at dinner and someone else died of toadstool poisoning. And it makes me feel dirty. It makes me feel filthy. I guess maybe it also explains why I finally called you. I\u0027d do anything right now to nail this guy. Anything at all.\u0027\\n\\n Outside, a giant orange plow loomed out of the snow like something from a horror movie. It parked and two men got out. They crossed the street to Jon\u0027s and sat at the counter. Johnny finished his tea. He no longer wanted the chili.\\n\\n \u0027This guy goes back to his bench,\u0027 Bannerman resumed, \u0027but not for long. Around 9:25 he hears the Harrington boy and the Loggins girl coming back from the library. So he goes back behind the bandstand again. It must have been around 9:25 because the librarian signed them out at 9:18. At 9:45 three boys from the fifth grade went past the bandstand on their way to the library. One of them thinks he might have seen \"some guy\" standing on the other side of the bandstand. That\u0027s our whole description. \"Some guy.\" We ought to put it out on the wire, what do you think? Be on the lookout for some guy.\\n\\n Bannerman uttered a short laugh like a bark.\\n\\n \u0027At 9:55 my daughter and her friend Susan go by on their way back to school. Then, about 10:05, Mary Kate Hendrasen came along ... by herself. Katrina and Sue met her going down the school steps as they were going up. They all said hi.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dear God,\u0027 Johnny muttered. He ran his hands through his hair.\\n\\n \u0027Last of all, 10:20 A.M. The three fifth-grade boys are coming back. One of them sees something on the bandstand. It\u0027s Mary Kate, with her leotard and her underpants yanked down, blood all over her legs, her face - -\u0027 her face -- -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Take it easy,\u0027 Johnny said, and put a hand on Banner-man\u0027s arm.\\n\\n \u0027No, I can\u0027t take it easy,\u0027 Bannerman said. He spoke almost apologetically. \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like that, not in eighteen years of police work. He raped that little girl and that would have been enough - enough to, you know, kill her - the medical examiner said the way he did it - he ruptured something and it - yeah, it probably would have, well - killed her - but then he had to go on and choke her. Nine years old and choked and left - left on the bandstand with her underpants pulled down.\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly Bannerman began to cry. The tears filled his eyes behind his glasses and then rolled down his face in two streams. At the counter the two guys from the Bridgton road crew were talking about the Superbowl. Bannerman took his glasses off again and mopped his face with his handkerchief. His shoulders shook and heaved. Johnny waited, stirring his chili aimlessly.\\n\\n After a little while, Bannerman put his handkerchief away. His eyes were red, and Johnny thought how oddly naked his face looked without his glasses.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, man,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s been a very long day.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027I knew I was going to do that, but I thought I could hold on until I got home to my wife.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I guess that was just too long to wait.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a sympathetic ear.\u0027 Bannerman slipped his glasses back on. \u0027No, you\u0027re more than that. You\u0027ve got something. I\u0027ll be damned if I know just what it is, but it\u0027s something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What else have you got to go on?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. I\u0027m taking most of the heat, but the state police haven\u0027t exactly distinguished themselves. Neither has the attorney general\u0027s special investigator, or our pet FBI man. The county M.E. has been able to type the sperm, but that\u0027s no good to us at this stage of the game. The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of hair or skin under the victim\u0027s fingernails. They all must have struggled, but we don\u0027t have as much as a centimeter of skin. The devil must be on this guy\u0027s side. He hasn\u0027t dropped a button or a shopping list or left a single damn track. We got a shrink from Augusta, also courtesy of the state A.G., and he tells us all these guys give themselves away sooner or later. Some comfort. What if it\u0027s later -say about twelve bodies from now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The cigarette pack is in Castle Rock?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny stood up. \u0027Well, let\u0027s take a ride.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My car?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny smiled a little as the wind rose, shrieking, outside. \u0027On a night like this, it pays to be with a policeman, he said.\\n\\n 7.\\n\\n The snowstorm was at its height and it took them an hour and a half to get over to Castle Rock in Bannerman\u0027s cruiser. It was twenty past ten when they came in through the foyer of the Town Office Building and stamped the snow off their boots.\\n\\n There were half a dozen reporters in the lobby, most of them sitting on a bench under a gruesome oil portrait of some town founding father, telling each other about previous night watches. They were up and surrounding Bannerman and Johnny in no time.\\n\\n \u0027Sheriff Bannerman, is it true there has been a break in the case?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have nothing for you at this time,\u0027 Bannerman said stolidly.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s been a rumor that you\u0027ve taken a man from Oxford into custody, Sheriff, is that true?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. If you folks will pardon us ...\\n\\n But their attention had turned to Johnny, and he felt a sinking sensation in his belly as he recognized at least two faces from the press conference at the hospital.\\n\\n \u0027Holy God!\u0027 one of them exclaimed. \u0027You\u0027re John Smith, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny felt a crazy urge to take the fifth like a gangster at a Senate committee hearing.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The psychic guy?\u0027 another asked.\\n\\n \u0027Look, let us pass!\u0027 Bannerman said, raising his voice. \u0027Haven\u0027t you guys got anything better to do than -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027According to Inside View, you\u0027re a fake,\u0027 a young man in a heavy topcoat said. \u0027Is that true?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All I can say about that is Inside View prints what they want,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Look, really -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re denying the Inside View story?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, I really can\u0027t say anything more.\u0027\\n\\n As they went through the frosted glass door and into the sheriff\u0027s office, the reporters were racing toward the two pay phones on the wall by the dog warden\u0027s office.\\n\\n \u0027Now the shit has truly hit the fan,\u0027 Bannerman said unhappily. \u0027I swear before God I never thought they\u0027d still be here on a night like this. I should have brought you in the back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, didn\u0027t you know?\u0027 Johnny asked bitterly. \u0027We love the publicity. All of us psychics are in it for the publicity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t believe that,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027At least not of you. Well, it\u0027s happened. Can\u0027t be helped now.\u0027\\n\\n But in his mind, Johnny could visualize the headlines:\\n\\n a little extra seasoning in a pot of stew that was already bubbling briskly. CASTLE ROCK SHERIFF DEPUTIZES LOCAL PSYCHIC IN STRANGLER CASE. \u0027NOVEMBER KILLER\u0027 TO BE INVESTIGATED BY SEER. HOAX ADMISSION STORY A FABRICATION, SMITH PROTESTS.\\n\\n There were two deputies in the outer office, one of them snoozing, the other drinking coffee and looking glumly through a pile of reports.\\n\\n \u0027His wife kick him out or something?\u0027 Bannerman asked sourly, nodding toward the sleeper.\\n\\n \u0027He just got back from Augusta,\u0027 the deputy said. He was little more than a kid himself, and there were dark circles of weariness under his eyes. He glanced over at Johnny curiously.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny Smith, Frank Dodd. Sleeping beauty over there is Roscoe Fisher.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny nodded hello.\\n\\n \u0027Roscoe says the A.G. wants the whole case,\u0027 Dodd told Bannerman. His look was angry and defiant and somehow pathetic. \u0027Some Christmas present, huh?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman put a hand on the back of Dodd\u0027s neck and shook him gently. \u0027You worry too much, Frank. Also, you\u0027re spending too much time on the case.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just keep thinking there must be something in these reports...\u0027 He shrugged and then flicked them with one finger. \u0027Something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go home and get some rest, Frank. And take sleeping beauty with you. All we need is for one of those photographers to get a picture of him. They\u0027d run it in the papers with a caption like \"In Castle Rock the Intensive Investigation Goes On,\" and we\u0027d all be out sweeping streets.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman led Johnny into his private office. The desk was awash in paperwork. On the windowsill was a triptych showing Bannerman, his wife, and his daughter Katrina. His degree hung neatly framed on the wall, and beside it, in another frame, the front page of the Castle Rock Call which had announced his election.\\n\\n \u0027Coffee?\u0027 Bannerman asked him, unlocking a file cabinet.\\n\\n \u0027No thanks. I\u0027ll stick to tea.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mrs. Sugarman guards her tea jealously,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Takes it home with her every day, sorry. I\u0027d offer you a tonic, but we\u0027d have to run the gauntlet out there again to get to the machine. Jesus Christ, I wish they\u0027d go home.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s okay.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman came back with a small clasp envelope. \u0027This is it,\u0027 he said. He hesitated for a moment, then handed the envelope over.\\n\\n Johnny held it but did not immediately open it. \u0027As long as you understand that nothing comes guaranteed. I can\u0027t promise. Sometimes I can and sometimes I can\u0027t.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman shrugged tiredly and repeated: \u0027No venture, no gain.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny undid the clasp and shook an empty Marlboro cigarette box out into his hand. Red and white box. He held it in his left hand and looked at the far wall. Gray wall. Industrial gray wall. Red and white box. Industrial gray box. He put the cigarette package in his other hand, then cupped it in both. He waited for something, anything to come. Nothing did. He held it longer, hoping against hope, ignoring the knowledge that when things come, they came at once.\\n\\n At last he handed the cigarette box back. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027No soap, huh?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n There was a perfunctory tap at the door and Roscoe Fisher stuck his head in. He looked a bit shamefaced. \u0027Frank and I are going home, George. I guess you caught me coopin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As long as I don\u0027t catch you doing it in your cruiser,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Say hi to Deenie for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You bet.\u0027 Fisher glanced at Johnny for a moment and then closed the door.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027It was worth the try, I guess. I\u0027ll run you back...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I want to go over to the common,\u0027 Johnny said abruptly.\\n\\n \u0027No, that\u0027s no good. It\u0027s under a foot of snow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can find the place, can\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I can. But what\u0027ll it gain?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. But let\u0027s go across.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Those reporters are going to follow us, Johnny. Just as sure as God made little fishes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said something about a back door.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, but it\u0027s a fire door. Getting in that way is okay, but if we use it to go out, the alarm goes off.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny whistled through his teeth. \u0027Let them follow along, then.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman looked at him thoughtfully, for several moments and then nodded. \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n 8.\\n\\n When they came out of the office, the reporters were up and surrounding them immediately. Johnny was reminded of a rundown kennel over in Durham where a strange old woman kept collies. The dogs would all runout at you when you went past with your fishing pole, yapping and snarling and generally scaring the hell out of you. They would nip but not actually bite.\\n\\n \u0027Do you know who did it, Johnny?\u0027 \u0027Have any ideas at all?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got any brainwaves, Mr. Smith?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sheriff, was calling in a psychic your idea?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do the state police and the A.G.\u0027s office know about this development, Sheriff Bannerman?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you think you can break the case, Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sheriff, have you deputized this guy?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman pushed his way slowly and solidly through them, zipping his coat. \u0027No comment, no comment.\u0027 Johnny said nothing at all.\\n\\n The reporters clustered in the foyer as Johnny and Bannerman went down the snowy steps. It wasn\u0027t until they bypassed the cruiser and began wading across the street that one of them realized they were going to the common. Several of them ran back for their topcoats. Those who had been dressed for outside when Banner-man and Johnny emerged from the office now floundered down the Town Office steps after them, calling like children.\\n\\n 9.\\n\\n Flashlights bobbing in the snowy dark. The wind howled, blowing snow past them this way and that in errant sheets.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not gonna be able to see a damn thing,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027You w ... holy shit!\u0027 He was almost knocked off his feet as a reporter in a bulky overcoat and a bizarre tam o\u0027shanter sprawled into him.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Sheriff,\u0027 he said sheepishly. \u0027Slippery. Forgot my galoshes.\u0027\\n\\n Up ahead a yellow length of nylon rope appeared out of the gloom. Attached to it was a wildly swinging sign reading POLICE INVESTIGATION.\\n\\n \u0027You forgot your brains, too,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027No- you keep back, all of you! Keep right back!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Town common\u0027s public property, Sheriff!\u0027 one of the reporters cried.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, and this is police business. You stay be-hind this rope here or you\u0027ll spend the night in my holding cell.\u0027\\n\\n With the beam of his flashlight he traced the course of the rope for them and then held it up so Johnny could pass beneath. They walked down the slope toward the snow-mounded shapes of the benches. Behind them the reporters gathered at the rope, pooling their few lights so that Johnny and George Bannerman walked in a dull sort of spotlight,\\n\\n \u0027Flying blind,\u0027 Bannerman said.\\n\\n \u0027Well, there\u0027s nothing to see, anyway,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Is there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not now. I told Frank he could take that rope down anytime. Now I\u0027m glad he didn\u0027t get around to it. You want to go over to the bandstand?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not yet. Show me where the cigarette butts were.\u0027 They went on a little farther and then Bannerman stopped. \u0027Here,\u0027 he said, and shone his light on a bench that was little more than a vague hump poking out of a drift.\\n\\n Johnny took off his gloves and put them in his coat pockets. Then he knelt and began to brush the snow away from the seat of the bench. Again Bannerman was struck by the haggard pallor of the man\u0027s face. On his knees before the bench he looked like a religious penitent, a man in desperate prayer.\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s hands went cold, then mostly numb. Melted now ran off his fingers. He got down to the splintered, weatherbeaten surface of the bench. He seemed to see it very clearly, almost with magnifying power. It had once been green, but now much of the paint had flaked and eroded away. Two rusted steel bolts held the seat to the backrest.\\n\\n He seized the bench in both hands, and sudden weirdness flooded him he had felt nothing so intense before and would feel something so intense only once ever again.\\n\\n He stared down at the bench, frowning, gripping it tightly in his hands. It -...\\n\\n (A summer bench)\\n\\n How many hundreds of different people had sat here at one time or another, listening to \u0027God Bless America\u0027, to \u0027Stars and Stripes Forever\u0027 (\u0027Be hind to your web-footed friends... for a duck may be somebody\u0027s moooother...\u0027), to the Castle Rock Cougars\u0027 fight song? Green summer leaves, smoky haze of fall like a memory of cornhusks and men with rakes in mellow dusk. The thud of the big snare drum. Mellow gold trumpets and trombones. School band uniforms ...\\n\\n (for a duck ... may be... somebody\u0027s mother...)\\n\\n Good summer people sitting here, listening. applauding, holding programs that had been designed and printed in the Castle Rock High School graphic arts shop.\\n\\n But this morning a killer had been sitting here. Johnny could feel him.\\n\\n Dark tree branches etched against a gray snow-sky like runes. He(I) am sitting here, smoking, waiting, feeling good, feeling like he(I) could jump right over the roof of the world and land lightly on two feet. Humming a song. Something by the Rolling Stones. Can\u0027t get that, but very dearly everything is... is what?\\n\\n All right. Everything is all right) everything is gray and waiting for snow, and Em...\\n\\n \u0027Slick,\u0027 Johnny muttered. \u0027I\u0027m slick, I\u0027m so slick.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman leaned forward, unable to catch the words over the howling wind. \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Slick,\u0027 Johnny repeated. He looked up at Bannerman and the Sheriff involuntarily took a step backward. Johnny\u0027s eyes were cool and somehow inhuman. His dark hair blew wildly around his white face, and overhead the winter wind screamed through the black sky. His hands seemed welded to the bench.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m so fucking slick,\u0027 he said clearly. A triumphant smile had formed on his lips. His eyes stared through Bannerman. Bannerman believed. No one could be acting this, or putting it on. And the most terrible part of it was... he was \u0027reminded of someone. The ....... the tone of voice ... Johnny Smith was gone; he seemed to have been replaced by a human blank. And lurking behind the planes of his ordinary features, almost near enough to touch. was another face. The face of the killer.\\n\\n The face of someone he knew.\\n\\n \u0027Never catch me because I\u0027m too slick for you.\u0027 A little laugh escaped him, confident, lightly taunting. \u0027I put it on every time, and if they scratch... or bite... they don\u0027t get a bit of me... because I\u0027m so SLICK !\u0027 His voice rose to a triumphant, crazy shriek that competed with the wind, and Bannerman fell back another step, his flesh crawling helplessly, his balls tight and cringing against his guts.\\n\\n Let it stop, he thought. Let it stop now. Please.\\n\\n Johnny bent his head over the bench. Melting snow dripped between his bare fingers.\\n\\n (Snow. Silent snow, secret snow -)\\n\\n (She put a clothespin on it so I\u0027d know how it felt. How it felt when you got a disease. A disease from one of those nasty-fuckers, they\u0027re all nasty. fuckers, and they have to be stopped, yes, stopped, stop them, stop, the stop, the STOP - OH MY GOD THE STOP SIGN -!)\\n\\n He was little again. Going to school through the silent, secret snow. And there was a man looming out of the shifting whiteness, a terrible man, a terrible black grinning man with eyes as shiny as quarters, and there was a red STOP sign clutched in one gloved hand... him! ... him! . . him!\\n\\n (OH MY GOD DON\u0027T ... DON\u0027T LET HIM GET ME ... MOMMA ... DON\u0027T LET HIM GET MEEEEE...)\\n\\n Johnny screamed and fell away from the bench, his hands suddenly pressed to his cheeks. Bannerman crouched beside him, badly frightened. Behind the rope the reporters stirred and murmured.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny! Snap out of it! Listen, Johnny...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Slick,\u0027 Johnny muttered. He looked up at Bannerman with hurt, frightened eyes. In his mind he still saw that black shape with the shiny-quarter eyes looming out of the snow. His crotch throbbed dully from the pain of the clothespin the killer\u0027s mother had made him wear. He hadn\u0027t been the killer then, oh no, not an animal, not a pusbag or a shitbag or whatever Bannerman had called him, he\u0027d only been a scared little boy with a clothespin on his...his...\\n\\n \u0027Help me get up,\u0027 he muttered.\\n\\n Bannerman helped him to his feet. \u0027The bandstand now,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027No, I think we ought to go back, Johnny.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny pushed past him blindly and began to flounder toward the bandstand, a big circular shadow up ahead. It bulked and loomed in the darkness, the death place. Bannerman ran and caught up to him.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny, who is it? Do you know who...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You never found any scraps of tissue under their finger. nails because he was wearing a raincoat,\u0027 Johnny said, He panted the words out. \u0027A raincoat with a hood. A slick vinyl raincoat. You go back over the reports. You go back over the reports and you\u0027ll see. It was raining or snowing every time. They clawed at him, all right. They fought him. Sure they did. But their fingers just slipped and slid over it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who, Johnny? Who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027m going to find out.\u0027\\n\\n He stumbled over the lowest of the six steps leading up to the bandstand, fumbled for his balance, and would have lost it if Bannerman had not gripped his arm. Then they were up on the stage. The snow was thin here, a bare dusting, kept off by the conical roof. Bannerman trained his flashlight beam on the floor and Johnny dropped to his hands and knees and began to crawl slowly across it. His hands were bright red. Bannerman thought they must be like chunks of raw meat by now.\\n\\n Johnny stopped suddenly and stiffened like a dog on point. \u0027Here,\u0027 he muttered. \u0027He did it right here.\u0027\\n\\n Images and textures and sensations flooded in. The copper taste of excitement, the possibility of being seen adding to it. The girl was squirming, trying to scream. He had covered her mouth with one gloved hand. Awful excitement. Never catch me, I\u0027m the Invisible Man, is it dirty enough for you now, momma?\\n\\n Johnny began to moan, shaking his head back and forth.\\n\\n Sound of clothes ripping. Warmth. Something flowing. Blood? Semen? Urine?\\n\\n He began to shudder all over. His hair hung in his face. His face. His smiling, open face caught inside the circular border of the raincoat\u0027s hood as his (my) hands close around the neck at the moment of orgasm and squeeze... and squeeze... and squeeze.\\n\\n The strength left his arms as the images began to fade. He slipped forward, now lying on the stage full-length, sobbing. When Bannerman touched his shoulder he cried out and tried to scramble away, his face crazy with fear. Then, little by little, it loosened. He put his head back against the waist-high bandstand railing and closed his eyes. Shudders raced through his body like whippets. His pants and coat were sugared with snow.\\n\\n \u0027I know who it is,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n 10.\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later Johnny sat in Bannerman\u0027s inner office again, stripped to his shorts and sitting as close as he could to a portable electric heater. He still looked cold and miserable, but he had stopped shaking.\\n\\n \u0027Sure you don\u0027t want some coffee?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny shook his head. \u0027I can\u0027t abide the stuff.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny...\u0027 Bannerman sat down. \u0027Do you really know something?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know who killed them. You would have gotten him eventually. You were just too close to it. You\u0027ve even seen him in his raincoat, that shiny all-over raincoat. Because he crosses the kids in the morning. He has a stop sign on a stick and he crosses the kids in the morning.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman looked at him, thunderstruck. \u0027Are you talking about Frank? Frank Dodd? You\u0027re nuts!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Frank Dodd killed them,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Frank Dodd killed them all.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman looked as though he didn\u0027t know whether to laugh at Johnny or deal him a good swift kick. \u0027That\u0027s the craziest goddam thing I\u0027ve ever heard,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027Frank Dodd\u0027s a fine officer and a fine man. He\u0027s crossing over next November to run for municipal chief of police, and he\u0027ll do it with my blessing.\u0027 Now his expression was one of amusement mixed with tired contempt. \u0027Frank\u0027s twenty-five. That means he would have had to have started this crazy shit when he was just nineteen. He lives at home very quietly with his mother, who isn\u0027t very well hypertension, thyroid, and a semidiabetic condition. Johnny, you put your foot in the bucket. Frank Dodd is no murderer. I\u0027d stake my life on that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The murders stopped for two years,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Where was Frank Dodd then? Was he in town?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman turned toward him, and now the tired amusement had left his face and he only looked hard. Hard and angry. \u0027I don\u0027t want to hear any more about this. You were right the first time - you\u0027re nothing but a fake. Well, you got your press coverage, but that doesn\u0027t mean I have to listen to you malign a good officer, a man\\n\\n I...\\n\\n \u0027A man you think of as your son,\u0027 Johnny said quietly. Bannerman\u0027s lips thinned, and a lot of the color that had risen in his cheeks during their time outside now faded out of his face. He looked like a man who has been punched low. Then it passed and his face was expressionless.\\n\\n \u0027Get out of here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Get one of your reporter friends to give you a ride home. You can hold a press conference on your way. But I swear to God, I swear to holy God that if you mention Frank Dodd\u0027s name, I\u0027ll come for you and I\u0027ll break your back. Understood?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure, my buddies from the press!\u0027 Johnny shouted at him suddenly. \u0027That\u0027s right! Didn\u0027t you see me answering all their questions? Posing for their pictures and making sure they got my good side?. Making sure they spelled my name right?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman looked startled, then hard again. \u0027Lower your voice.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027ll be goddamned if I will!\u0027 Johnny said, and his voice rose even higher in pitch and volume. \u0027I think you forgot who called who! I\u0027ll refresh your recollection for you. It was you, calling me. That\u0027s how eager I was to get over here!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean you.....\\n\\n Johnny walked over to Bannerman, pointing his index finger like a pistol. He was several inches shorter and probably eighty pounds lighter, but Bannerman backed up a step - as he had done on the common. Johnny\u0027s cheeks had flushed a dull red. His lips were drawn back slightly from his teeth.\\n\\n \u0027No, you\u0027re right, you calling me doesn\u0027t mean shit in a tin bucket,\u0027 he said. \u0027But you don\u0027t want it to be Dodd, do you? It can be somebody else, then we\u0027ll at least look into it, but it can\u0027t be good old Frank Dodd. Because Frank\u0027s upstanding, Frank takes care of his mother, Frank looks up to good old Sheriff George Bannerman, oh, Frank\u0027s bloody Christ down from the cross except when he\u0027s raping and strangling old ladies and little girls, and it could have been your daughter, Bannerman, don\u0027t you understand it could have been your own\\n\\n Bannerman hit him. At the last moment he pulled the punch, but it was still hard enough to knock Johnny backward; he stumbled over the leg of a chair and then sprawled on the floor. Blood trickled from his cheek where Bannerman\u0027s Police Academy ring had grazed him.\\n\\n \u0027You had that coming,\u0027 Bannerman said, but there was no real conviction in his voice. It occurred to him that for the first time in his life he had hit a cripple - or the next thing to a cripple.\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s head felt light and full of bells. His voice seemed to belong to someone else, a radio announcer or a B-movie actor. \u0027You ought to get down on your knees and thank God that he really didn\u0027t leave any clues, because you would have overlooked them, feeling like you do about Dodd. And then you could have held yourself responsible in Mary Kate Hendrasen\u0027s death, as an accessory.\\n\\n \u0027That is nothing but a damnable lie,\u0027 Bannerman said slowly and clearly. \u0027I\u0027d arrest my own brother if he was the guy doing this. Get up off the floor. I\u0027m sorry I hit you.\\n\\n He helped Johnny to his feet and looked at the scrape on his cheek.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll get the first-aid kit and put some iodine on that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget it,\u0027 Johnny said. The anger had left his voice. \u0027I guess I kind of sprang it on you, didn\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m telling you, it can\u0027t be Frank. You\u0027re not a publicity hound, okay. I was wrong about that. Heat of the moment, okay? But your vibes or your astral plane or whatever it is sure gave you a bum steer this time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then check,\u0027 Johnny said. He caught Bannerman\u0027s eyes with his own and held them. \u0027Check it out. Show me I got it wrong.\u0027 He swallowed. \u0027Check the times and dates against Frank\u0027s work schedule. Can you do that?\u0027\\n\\n Grudgingly, Bannerman said, \u0027The time cards in the back closet there go back fourteen or fifteen years. I guess I could check it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mister ...\u0027 He paused. \u0027Johnny, if you knew Frank, you\u0027d laugh at yourself. I mean it. It\u0027s not just me, you ask anybody...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If I\u0027m wrong, I\u0027ll be glad to admit it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is crazy,\u0027 Bannerman muttered, but he went to the storage closet where the old time cards were kept and opened the door.\\n\\n 11.\\n\\n Two hours passed. It was now nearly one o\u0027clock in the morning. Johnny had called his father and told him he would find a place to sleep in Castle Rock; the storm had leveled off at a single furious pitch, and driving back would be next to impossible.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s going on over there?\u0027 Herb asked. \u0027Can you tell me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I better not over the phone, Dad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, Johnny. Don\u0027t exhaust yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n But he was exhausted. He was more tired than he could remember being since those early days in physical therapy with Eileen Magown. A nice woman, he thought randomly. A nice friendly woman, at least until I told her that her house was burning down. After that she had become distant and awkward. She had thanked him, sure, but - had she ever touched him after that? Actually touched him? Johnny didn\u0027t think so. And it would be the same with Bannerman when this thing was over. Too bad. Like Eileen, he was a fine man. But people get very nervous around people who can just touch things and know all about them.\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t prove a thing,\u0027 Bannerman was saying now. There was a sulky, little-boy rebelliousness in his voice that made Johnny want to grab him and shake him until he rattled. But he was too tired.\\n\\n They were looking down at a rough chart Johnny had made on the back of a circular for used state police interceptors. Stacked untidily by Bannerman\u0027s desk were seven or eight cartons of old time cards, and sitting in the top half of Bannerman\u0027s in/out basket were Frank Dodd\u0027s cards, going back to 1971, when he had joined the sheriff\u0027s department. The chart looked like this:\\n\\n THE MURDERS - FRANK DODD\\n\\n Alma Frechette (waitress) Then working at Main Street\\n\\n 3:00PM, 11/12/70 Gulf Station\\n\\n Pauline Toothaker Off-duty\\n\\n 10:00AM, 11/17/71\\n\\n Cheryl Moody U.H.S. student) Off-duty\\n\\n 2:00 PM, 12/16/71\\n\\n Carol Dunbarger (H.S. student) Two-week vacation period\\n\\n 11/?/74\\n\\n Etta Ringgold (teacher) Regular duty tours\\n\\n 10/29(?)/75\\n\\n Mary Kate Hendrasen Off-duty\\n\\n 10:10 AM, 12/17/75\\n\\n All times are \u0027estimated time of death\u0027 figures supplied by State Medical Examiner\\n\\n \u0027No, it doesn\u0027t prove anything,\u0027 Johnny agreed, rubbing his temples. \u0027But it doesn\u0027t exactly rule him out, either.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman tapped the chart. \u0027When Miss Ringgold was killed, he was on duty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, if she really was killed on the twenty-ninth of October. But it might have been the twenty-eighth, or the twenty-seventh. And even if he was on duty, who suspects a cop?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman was looking at the little chart very carefully.\\n\\n \u0027What about the gap?\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027The two-year gap?\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman thumbed the time cards. \u0027Frank was right here on duty all during 1973 and 1974. You saw that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So maybe the urge didn\u0027t come on him that year. At least, so far as we know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So far as we know, we don\u0027t know anything,\u0027 Banner-man contradicted quickly.\\n\\n \u0027But what about 1972? Late 1972 and early 1973? There are no time cards for that period. Was he on vacation?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Frank and a guy named Tom Harrison took a semester course in Rural Law Enforcement at a branch of the University of Colorado in Pueblo. It\u0027s the only place in the country where they offer a deal like that. It\u0027s an eight-week course. Frank and Tom were out there from October 15 until just about Christmas. The state pays part, the county pays part, and the U.S. government pays part under the Law Enforcement Act of 1971.I picked Harrison - he\u0027s chief of police over in Gates Falls now - and Frank. Frank almost didn\u0027t go, because he was worried about his mother being alone. To tell you the truth, I think she tried to persuade him to stay home. I talked him into it. He wants to be a career officer, and something like the Rural Law Enforcement course looks damn good on your record. I remember that when he and Tom got back in December, Frank had a low-grade virus and he looked terrible. He\u0027d lost twenty pounds. Claimed no one out there in cow country could cook like his mom.\\n\\n Bannerman fell silent. Something in what he had just said seemed to disturb him.\\n\\n \u0027He took a week\u0027s sick leave around the holidays and then he was okay,\u0027 Bannerman resumed, almost defensively. \u0027He was back by the fifteenth of January at the latest. Check the time cards for yourself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t have to. Any more than I have to tell you what your next step is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Bannerman said. He looked at his hands. \u0027I told you that you had a head for this stuff. Maybe I was righter than I knew. Or wanted to be.\u0027\\n\\n He picked up the telephone and pulled out a thick directory with a plain blue cover from the bottom drawer of his desk. Paging through it without looking up, he told Johnny, \u0027This is courtesy of that same Law Enforcement Act. Every sheriff\u0027s office in every county of the United States.\u0027 He found the number he wanted and made his call.\\n\\n Johnny shifted in his seat.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 Bannerman said. \u0027Am I talking to the Pueblo sheriff\u0027s office? ... All right. My name is George Banner-man, I\u0027m the county sheriff of Castle County, in western Maine... yes, that\u0027s what I said. State of Maine. Who am I talking to, please? ... All right, Officer Taylor, this is the situation. We\u0027ve had a series of murders out here, rape-stranglings, six of them in the past five years. All of them have taken place in the late fall or early winter. We have a ...\u0027 He looked up at Johnny for a moment, his eyes hurt and helpless. Then he looked down at the phone again. \u0027We have a suspect who was in Pueblo from October 15 of 1972 until ... uh, December 17, I think. What I\u0027d like to know is if you have an unsolved homicide on your books during that period, victim female, no particular age, raped, cause of death, strangulation. Further, I would like to know the perpetrator\u0027s sperm type if you have had such a crime and a sperm sample was obtained. What? ... Yes, okay. Thanks ... I\u0027ll be right here, waiting. Good-bye, Officer Taylor.\u0027\\n\\n He hung up. \u0027He\u0027s going to verify my bona fides, then check it through, then call me back. You want a cup of no, you don\u0027t drink it, do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027ll settle for a glass of water.\u0027\\n\\n He went over to the big glass cooler and drew a paper cupful of water. Outside the storm howled and pounded.\\n\\n Behind him, Bannerman said awkwardly: \u0027Yeah, okay. You were right. He\u0027s the son I\u0027d\u0027ve liked to have had. My wife had Katrina by cesarian. She can never have another one, the doctor said it would kill her. She had the Band-Aid operation and I had a vasectomy. Just to be sure.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny went to the window and looked out on darkness, his cup of water in his hand. There was nothing to see but snow, but if he turned around, Bannerman would break off - you didn\u0027t have to be psychic to know that.\\n\\n \u0027Frank\u0027s dad worked on the B\u0026M line and died in an accident when Frank was five or so. He was drunk, tried to make a coupling in a state where he probably would have pissed down his own leg and never known it. He got crushed between two flatcars. Frank\u0027s had to be the man of the house ever since. Roscoe says he had a girl in high school, but Mrs. Dodd put paid to that in a hurry.\u0027\\n\\n I bet she did, Johnny thought. A woman who would do that thing... that clothespin thing... to her own son... that sort of woman would stop at nothing. She\u0027 must be almost as crazy as he is.\\n\\n \u0027He came to me when he was sixteen and asked if there was such a thing as a part-time policeman. Said it was the only thing he\u0027d ever really wanted to do or be since he was a kid. I took a shine to him right off. Hired him to work around the place and paid him out of my own pocket. Paid him what I could, you know, he never complained about the wages. He was the Sort of kid who would have worked for free. He put in an application for full-time work the month before he graduated from high school, but at that time we didn\u0027t have any vacancies. So he went to work at Donny Haggar\u0027s Gulf and took a night course in police work at the university down in Gorham. I guess Mrs. Dodd tried to put paid to that, too - felt she was alone too much of the time, or something - but that time Frank stood up to her ... with my encouragement. We took him on in July of 1971 and he\u0027s been with the department ever since. Now you tell me this and I think of Katrina being out yesterday morning, walking right past whoever did it ... and it\u0027s like some dirty kind of incest, almost. Frank\u0027s been at our house, he\u0027s eaten our food, babysat Katie once or twice... and you tell me...\\n\\n Johnny turned around. Bannerman had taken off his glasses and was wiping his eyes again.\\n\\n \u0027If you really can see such things, I pity you. You\u0027re a freak of God, no different from a two-headed cow I once saw in the carnival. I\u0027m sorry. That\u0027s a shit thing to say, I know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Bible says God loves all his creatures,\u0027 Johnny said. His voice was a bit unsteady.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah?\u0027 Bannerman nodded and rubbed the red places on the sides of his nose where his glasses sat. \u0027Got a funny way of showing it, doesn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n 12.\\n\\n About twenty minutes later the telephone rang and Bannerman answered it smartly. Talked briefly. Listened.\\n\\n Johnny watched his face get old. He hung up and looked at Johnny for a long time without speaking.\\n\\n \u0027November 12, 1972,\u0027 he said. \u0027A college girl. They found her in a field out by the turnpike. Ann Simons, her name was. Raped and strangled. Twenty-three years old. No semen type obtained. It\u0027s still not proof, Johnny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think, in your own mind, you need any more proof,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027And if you confront him with what you have, I think he\u0027ll break down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if he doesn\u0027t?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny remembered the vision on the handstand. It whirled back at him like a crazy, lethal boomerang. The tearing sensation. The pain that was pleasant, the pain that recalled the pain of the clothespin, the pain that reconfirmed everything.\\n\\n \u0027Get him to drop his pants,\u0027 Johnny said. Bannerman looked at him.\\n\\n 13.\\n\\n The reporters were still out in the lobby. In truth, they probably wouldn\u0027t have moved even had they not suspected a break in the case - or at least a bizarre new development. The roads out of town were impassable.\\n\\n Bannerman and Johnny went out the supply closet window.\\n\\n \u0027Are you sure this is the way to do it?\u0027 Johnny asked, and the storm tried to rip the words out of his mouth. His legs hurt.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Bannerman said simply, \u0027but I think you should be in on it. Maybe I think he should have the chance to look you in the face, Johnny. Come on. The Dodds are only two blocks from here.\u0027\\n\\n They set off, hooded and booted, a pair of shadows in the driving snow. Beneath his coat Bannerman was wearing his service pistol. His handcuffs were clipped to his belt. Before they had gone a block through the deep snow Johnny was limping badly, but he kept his mouth grimly shut about it.\\n\\n But Bannerman noticed. They stopped in the doorway of the Castle Rock Western Auto.\\n\\n \u0027Son, what\u0027s the matter with you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 Johnny said. His head was starting to ache again, too.\\n\\n \u0027It sure is something. You act like you\u0027re walking on two broken legs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They had to operate on my legs after I came out of the coma. The muscles had atrophied. Started to melt is how Dr. Brown put it. The joints were decayed. They fixed it up the best they could with synthetics...\\n\\n \u0027Like the Six Million Dollar Man, huh?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny thought of the neat piles of hospital hills back home, sitting in the top drawer of the dining room hutch.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, something like that. When I\u0027m on them too long, they stiffen up. That\u0027s all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You want to go back?\u0027\\n\\n You bet I do. Go back and not have\u0027 to think about this hellacious business anymore\u0027. Wish I\u0027d never come. Not my problem. This is the guy who compared me to a two-headed cow.\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027m okay,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n They stepped out of the doorway and the wind grabbed them and tried to bowl them along the empty street. They struggled through the harsh, snow-choked glare of arc-sodium streetlights, bent into the wind. They turned onto a side street and five houses down Bannerman stopped in front of a small and neat New England salt-box. Like the other houses on the street, it was dark and battened down.\\n\\n \u0027This is the house,\u0027 Bannerman said, his voice oddly colorless. They worked their way through the snowdrift that the wind had thrown against the porch and mounted the steps.\\n\\n 14.\\n\\n Mrs. Henrietta Dodd was a big woman who was carrying a dead weight of flesh on her frame. Johnny had never seen a woman who looked any sicker. Her skin was a yellowish-gray. Her hands were nearly reptilian with an eczemalike rash. And there was something in her eyes, narrowed to glittering slits in their puffy sockets, that reminded him unpleasantly of the way his mother\u0027s eyes had sometimes looked when Vera Smith was transported into one of her religious frenzies.\\n\\n She had opened the door to them after Bannerman had rapped steadily for nearly five minutes. Johnny stood beside him on his aching legs, thinking that this night would never end. It would just go on and on until the snow bad piled up enough to avalanche down and bury them all.\\n\\n \u0027What do you want in the middle of the night, George Bannerman?\u0027 she asked suspiciously. Like many fat women, her voice was a high, buzzy reed instrument - it sounded a bit like a fly or a bee caught in a bottle.\\n\\n \u0027Have to talk to Frank, Henrietta.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then talk to him in the morning,\u0027 Henrietta Dodd said, and started to close the door in their faces.\\n\\n Bannerman stopped the door\u0027s swing with a gloved hand. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, Henrietta. Has to be now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m not going to wake him up!\u0027 she cried, not moving from the doorway. \u0027He sleeps like the dead anyway! Some nights I ring my bell for him, the palpitations are terrible sometimes, and does he come? No, he sleeps right through it and he could wake up some morning to find me dead of a heart attack in my bed instead of getting him his goddam runny poached egg! Because you work him too hard!\u0027\\n\\n She grinned in a sour kind of triumph; the dirty secret exposed and hats over the windmill.\\n\\n \u0027All day, all night, swing shift, chasing after drunks in the middle of the night and any one of them could have a - gun under the seat, going out to the ginmills and honky-tonks, oh, they\u0027re a rough trade out there but a lot you mind! I guess I know what goes on in those places, those cheap slutty women that\u0027d be happy to give a nice boy like my Frank an incurable disease for the price of a quarter beer!\u0027\\n\\n Her voice, that reed instrument, swooped and buzzed. Johnny\u0027s head pumped and throbbed in counterpoint. He wished she would shut up. It was a hallucination, he knew, just the tiredness and stress of this awful night catching up, but it began to seem more and more to him that this was his mother standing here, that at any moment she would turn from Bannerman to him and begin to huckster him about the wonderful talent God had given him.\\n\\n \u0027Mrs. Dodd ... Henrietta ...\u0027 Bannerman began patiently.\\n\\n Then she did turn to Johnny, and regarded him with her smart-stupid little pig\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Special deputy,\u0027 Bannerman said promptly. \u0027Henrietta, I\u0027ll take the responsibility for waking Frank up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oooh, the responsibility!\u0027 she cooed with monstrous, buzzing sarcasm, and Johnny finally realized she was afraid. The fear was coming off her in pulsing, noisome waves - that was what was making his headache worse. Couldn\u0027t Bannerman feel it? \u0027The ree-spon-si-bil-i-tee! Isn\u0027t that big of you, my God yes! Well, I won\u0027t have my boy waked up in the middle of the night, George Bannerman, so you and your special deputy can just go peddle your goddam papers!\u0027\\n\\n She tried to shut the door again and this time Banner-man shoved it all the way open. His voice showed tight anger and beneath that a terrible tension. \u0027Open up, Henrietta, I mean it, now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t do this!\u0027 she cried. \u0027This isn\u0027t no police state! I\u0027ll have your job! Let\u0027s see your warrant!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, that\u0027s right, but I\u0027m going to talk to Frank,\u0027 Bannerman said, and pushed past her.\\n\\n Johnny, barely aware of what he was doing, followed. Henrietta Dodd made a grab for him. Johnny caught her Wrist - and a terrible pain flared in his head, dwarfing the sullen thud of the headache. And the woman felt it, too. The two of them stared at each other for a moment that seemed to last forever, an awful, perfect understanding. For that moment they seemed welded together. Then she fell back, clutching at her ogre\u0027s bosom.\\n\\n \u0027My heart . .. my heart .. .\u0027 She scrabbled at her robe pocket and pulled out a phial of pills. Her face had gone to the color of raw dough. She got the cap off the phial and spilled tiny pills all over the floor getting one into her palm. She slipped it under her tongue. Johnny stood staring at her in mute horror. His head felt like a swelling bladder full of hot blood.\\n\\n \u0027You knew?\u0027 he whispered.\\n\\n Her fat, wrinkled mouth opened and closed, opened and closed. No sound came out. It was the mouth of a beached fish.\\n\\n \u0027All of this time you knew?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a devil!\u0027 she screamed at him. \u0027You\u0027re a monster ... devil ... oh my heart ... oh, I\u0027m dying ... think I\u0027m dying... call the doctor... George Bannerman don\u0027t you go up there and wake my baby!\u0027\\n\\n Johnny let go of her, and unconsciously rubbing his hand back and forth on his coat as if to free it of a stain, he stumbled up the stairs after Bannerman. The wind outside sobbed around the eaves like a lost child. Halfway up he glanced back. Henrietta Dodd sat in a wicker chair, a sprawled mountain of meat, gasping and holding a huge breast in each hand. His head still felt as if it were swelling and he thought dreamily: Pretty soon it\u0027ll just pop and that\u0027ll be the end. Thank God.\\n\\n An old and threadbare runner covered the narrow hall floor. The wallpaper was watermarked. Bannerman was pounding on a closed door. It was at least ten degrees colder up here.\\n\\n \u0027Frank? Frank! It\u0027s George Bannerman! Wake up, Frank!\u0027\\n\\n There was no response. Bannerman turned the knob and shoved the door open. His hand had fallen to the butt of his gun, but he had not drawn it. It could have been a fatal mistake, but Frank Dodd\u0027s room was empty.\\n\\n The two of them stood in the doorway for a moment, looking in. It was a child\u0027s room. The wallpaper - also watermarked - was covered with dancing clowns and rocking horses. There was a child-sized chair with a Raggedy Andy sitting in it, looking back at them with its shiny blank eyes. In one corner was a toybox. In the other was a narrow maple bed with the covers thrown back. Hooked over one of the bedposts and looking out of place was Frank Dodd\u0027s holstered gun.\\n\\n \u0027My God,\u0027 Bannerman said softly. \u0027What is this?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Help,\u0027 Mrs. Dodd\u0027s voice floated up. \u0027Help me\\n\\n \u0027She knew,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027She knew from the very beginning, from the Frechette woman. He told her. And she covered up for him.\u0027\\n\\n Bannerman backed slowly out of the room and opened another door. His eyes were dazed and hurt. It was a guest bedroom, unoccupied. He opened the closet, which was empty except for a neat tray of D-Con rat-killer on the floor. Another door. This bedroom was unfinished and cold enough to show Bannerman\u0027s breath. He looked around. There was another door, this one at the head of the stairs. He went to it, and Johnny followed. This door was locked.\\n\\n \u0027Frank? Are you in there?\u0027 He rattled the knob. \u0027Open it, Frank!\u0027\\n\\n There was no answer. Bannerman raised his foot and kicked out, connecting with the door just below the knob. There was a flat cracking sound that seemed to echo in Johnny\u0027s head like a steel platter dropped on a tile floor.\\n\\n \u0027Oh God,\u0027 Bannerman said in a flat, choked voice. \u0027Frank.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny could see over his shoulder, could see too much. Frank Dodd was propped on the lowered seat of the toilet. He was naked except for a shiny black raincoat, which he had looped over his shoulders; the raincoat\u0027s black hood (executioner\u0027s hood, Johnny thought dimly) dangled down on the top of the toilet tank like some grotesque, deflated black pod. He had somehow managed to cut his own throat - Johnny would not have thought that possible. There was a package of Wilkinson Sword Blades on the edge of the washbasin. A single blade lay on the floor, glittering wickedly. Drops of blood had beaded on its edge. The blood from his severed jugular vein and carotid artery had splashed everywhere. There were pools of it caught in the folds of the raincoat which dragged on the floor. It was on the shower curtain, which had a pattern of paddling ducks with umbrellas held over their heads. It was on the ceiling.\\n\\n Around Frank Dodd\u0027s neck on a string was a sign crayoned in lipstick. It read: I CONFESS.\\n\\n The pain in Johnny\u0027s head began to climb to a sizzling, insupportable peak. He groped out with a hand and found the doorjamb.\\n\\n Knew, he thought incoherently. Knew somehow when he\u0027 saw me. Knew it was all over. Came home. Did this.\\n\\n Black rings overlaying his sight, spreading like evil ripples.\\n\\n What a talent God has given you, Johnny.\\n\\n (I CONFESS)\\n\\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n From far away.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny, are you all...\u0027\\n\\n Fading. Everything fading away. That was good. Would have been better if he had never come out of the coma at all. Better for all concerned. Well, he had had his chance.\\n\\n \u0027 Johnny -\u0027\\n\\n Frank Dodd had come up here and somehow he had slit his throat from the ear to the proverbial ear while the storm howled outside like all the dark things of the earth let loose. Gone a gusher, as his father had said that winter twelve years or so ago, when the pipes in the basement had frozen and burst. Gone a gusher. Sure as hell had. All the way up to the ceiling.\\n\\n He believed that he might have screamed then, but afterward was never sure. It might only have been in his own head that he screamed. But he had wanted to scream;\\n\\n to scream out all the horror and pity and agony in his heart.\\n\\n Then he was falling forward into darkness, and grateful to go. Johnny blacked out.\\n\\n 15.\\n\\n From the New York Time\u0027s, December 19, 1975:\\n\\n MAINE PSYCHIC DIRECTS SHERIFF TO KILLER DEPUTY\u0027S HOME AFTER VISITING SCENE OF THE CRIME\\n\\n (Special to the Times) John Smith of Pownal may not actually be psychic, but one would have difficulty persuading Sheriff George F. Bannerman of Castle County, Maine, to believe that. Desperate after a sixth assault-murder in the small western Maine town of Castle Rock, Sheriff Bannerman called Mr. Smith on the phone and asked him to come over to Castle Rock and lend a hand, if possible. Mr. Smith, who received national attention earlier this year when he recovered from a deep coma after fifty-five months of unconsciousness, had been condemned by the weekly tabloid Inside View as a hoaxer, but at a press conference yesterday Sheriff Bannerman would only say, \u0027We don\u0027t put a whole lot of stock up here in Maine in what those New York reporters think.\u0027\\n\\n According to Sheriff Bannerman, Mr. Smith crawled on his hands and knees around the scene of the sixth murder, which occurred on the Castle Rock town common. He came up with a mild case of frostbite and the murderer\u0027s name - Sheriff\u0027s Deputy Franklin Dodd, who had been on the Castle County Sheriff\u0027s payroll five years, as long as Bannerman himself.\\n\\n Earlier this year Mr. Smith stirred controversy in his native state when he had a psychic flash that his physical therapist\u0027s house had caught fire. The flash turned out to be nothing but the truth. At a press conference following, a reporter challenged him to...\\n\\n From Newsweek, page 41, week of December 24, 1975:.\\n\\n THE NEW HURKOS\\n\\n It may be that the first genuine psychic since Peter Hurkos has been uncovered in this country Hurkos was the German-born seer who has been able to tell questioners all about their private lives by touching their hands, silverware, or items from their handbags.\\n\\n John Smith is a shy and unassuming young man from the south-central Maine town of Pownal. Earlier this year he returned to consciousness after a period of more than four years in a deep coma following a car accident (see photo). According to the consulting neurologist in the case, Dr. Samuel Weizak, Smith made a \u0027perfectly astounding recovery\u0027. Today he is recovering from a mild case of frostbite and a four-hour blackout following the bizarre resolution of a long-unsolved multiple murder case in the town of...\\n\\n December 27, 1975\\n\\n Dear Sarah,\\n\\n Dad and I both enjoyed your le\u0027tter, which arrived just this afternoon. I\u0027m really fine, so you can stop worrying, okay? But I thank you for your concern. The\u0027 \u0027frostbite\u0027 was greatly exaggerated in the press. Just a couple of patches on the\u0027 tips of three\u0027 fingers of my left hand. The\u0027 blackout was really nothing much more\u0027 than a fainting spell \u0027brought on by emotional overload\u0027, Weizak says. Yes, he came down himself and insisted on driving me to the hospital in Portland. Just watching him in action is nearly worth the price of admission. He bullied them into giving him a consultation room and an EEG machine and a technician to run it. He says he can find no new brain damage or signs of progressive brain damage. He wants to do a whole series of tests, some of them sound utterly inquisitorial - \u0027Renounce, heretic, or we\u0027ll give you another pneumo-brainscan!\u0027 (Ha-ha, and are you still sniffin\u0027 that wicked cocaine\u0027, darlin\u0027?) Anyway, I turned down the kind offer to be pumped and prodded some more. Dad is rather pissed at me about turning the tests down, keeps trying to draw a parallel between my refusal to have them and my mother\u0027s refusal to take her hypertension medicine. It\u0027s very hard to make him see\u0027 that, if Weizak did find something, the odds would be\u0027 nine-to-one against him being able to do anything about it.\\n\\n Yes, I saw the Newsweek article. That picture of me is from the press conference, only cropped. Don\u0027t look like anyone you\u0027d like to meet in a dark alley, do I? Ha-ha! Holy Gee (as your buddy Anne Strafford is so fond of saying), but I wish they hadn\u0027t run that story. The packages, cards, and letters have started coming again. l don\u0027t open any of them anymore unless I recognize the return address, just mark them \u0027Return to Sender\u0027. They are too pitiful, too full of hope and hate and belief and unbelief, and somehow they all remind me of the way my Mom was.\\n\\n Well, I don\u0027t mean to sound so gloomy, it ain\u0027t all that bad. But I don\u0027t want to be a practicing psychic, I don\u0027t want to go on tour or appear on TV (some yahoo from NBC got our phone number, who knows how, and wanted to know if I\u0027d consider \u0027doing the Carson show\u0027. Great idea, huh? Don Rickles could insult some people, some\u0027 starlet could show her jugs, and I could make a few predictions. All brought to you by General Foods.). I don\u0027t want to do any of that S~H~I~T. What l am really looking forward to is getting back to Cleaves Mills and sinking into the utter obscurity of the H.S. English teacher. And save the psychic flashes for football pep rallies.\\n\\n Guess that\u0027s all for this time. Hope you and Walt and Denny had yourself a merry little\u0027 Christmas and are looking forward eagerly (from what you said I\u0027m sure\u0027 Walt is, at the very least) to the Brave Bicentennial Election Year now stretching before us. Glad to hear your spouse has been picked to run for the state senate seat there, but cross your fingers, Sarey - \u002776 doesn\u0027t exactly look like\u0027 a banner year for elephant-lovers. Send your thanks for that one\u0027 across to San Clemente.\\n\\n My dad sends best and wants me to tell you thanks for the picture of Denny, who really impressed him. l send my best, also. Thanks for writing, and for your misplaced concern (misplaced, but very welcome). I\u0027m fine\u0027, and looking forward to getting back in harness.\\n\\n Love\u0027 and good wishes, Johnny\\n\\n P.S. For the\u0027 last time kiddo get off that cocaine\u0027.\\n\\n J.\\n\\n December 29, 1975\\n\\n Dear Johnny,\\n\\n I think this is the\u0027 hardest, bitterest letter I\u0027ve had to write in my sixteen years of school administration - not only because you\u0027re a good friend but because\u0027 you\u0027re a damned good teacher. There is no way to gild the lily on this, so guess I won\u0027t even try.\\n\\n There was a special meeting of the school board last evening (at the behest of two members I won\u0027t name, but they were on the board when you were\u0027 teaching here\u0027 and I think you can probably guess the names), and they voted 5-2 to ask that your contract be withdrawn. The\u0027 reason: you\u0027re too controversial to be effective as a teacher. I came very close\u0027 to tendering my own resignation; I was that disgusted. If it wasn\u0027t for Maureen and the kids, I think I would have. This abortion isn\u0027t even on a par with tossing Rabbit, Run or Catcher in the Rye out of the\u0027 classroom. This is worse\u0027. It stinks.\\n\\n I told them that, but I might as well have been talking in Esperanto or igpay atm lay. All they can see is that your picture was in Newsweek and the New York Times and that the Castle\u0027 Rock story was on the national network news broadcasts. Too controversial! Five\u0027 old men in trusses, the kind of men who are more interested in hair length than in textbooks, more\u0027 involved in finding out who might smoke pot on the\u0027 faculty than in finding out how to get some\u0027 twentieth-century equipment for the Sci Wing.\\n\\n l have written a strong letter of protest to the\u0027 board-at-large, and with a little arm-twisting I believe I can get Irving Finegold to cosign it with me\u0027. But I\u0027d also be\u0027 less than truthful if I told you there was a hope in he\u0027ll of getting those five old men to change their minds.\\n\\n My honest advice\u0027 to you is to get yourself a lawyer, Johnny. You signed that blueback in good faith, and I believe you can squeeze them for every last cent of your salary, whether you ever step into a Cleaves Mills class-room or not. And call me when you feel like\u0027 talking.\\n\\n With all my heart, I\u0027m sorry.\\n\\n Your friend, Dave\u0027 Pelsen\\n\\n 16.\\n\\n Johnny stood beside the mailbox with Dave\u0027s letter in his hand, looking down at it unbelievingly. It was the last day of \u0027975, clear and bitingly cold. His breath came out of his nostrils in fine white\u0027 jets of smoke.\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027Oh man, oh skit.\u0027\\n\\n Numbly, still not assimilating it totally, he\u0027 leaned down to see what else\u0027 the mailman had brought him. As usual, the box was crammed full It had just been luck that Dave\u0027s letter had been sticking out the end.\\n\\n There was a white, fluttering slip of paper telling him to call at the\u0027 post office\u0027 for the\u0027 packages, the\u0027 inevitable package\u0027s. My husband deserted me in 1969, here\u0027 is a pair of his socks, tell me\u0027 where he is so I can get child-support out of the\u0027 bastard. My baby choked to death last year, here\u0027 is his rattle, please write and tell me if he is happy with the angels. l didn\u0027t have\u0027 him baptized because\u0027 his father did not approve\u0027 and now my heart is breaking. The endless litany.\\n\\n What a talent God has given you, Johnny.\\n\\n The reason: You\u0027re\u0027 too controversial to be\u0027 effective\u0027 as a teacher.\\n\\n In a sudden vicious spasm he began to rake letters and manila envelopes out of the box, dropping some in the snow. The inevitable headache began to form around his temples like two dark clouds that would slowly draw together, enveloping him in pain. Sudden tears began to slip down his cheeks, and in the deep, stiff cold, they froze to glittering tracks almost immediately.\\n\\n He bent and began to pick up the letters he had dropped; he saw one, doubled and trebled through the prisms of his tears, addressed in heavy dark pencil to\\n\\n JOHN SMITH SIKIK SEER.\\n\\n Sikik seer, that\u0027s me. His hands began to tremble wildly and he dropped everything, including Dave\u0027s letter. It fluttered down like a leaf and landed print side up among the other letters, all the other letters. Through his helpless tears he could see the letterhead, and the motto below the torch:\\n\\n TO TEACH, TO LEARN, TO KNOW, TO SERVE.\\n\\n \u0027Serve my ass, you cheap bastards,\u0027 Johnny said. He fell on his knees and began to gather up the letters, sweeping them together with his mittens. His fingers ached dully, a reminder of the frostbite, a reminder of Frank Dodd riding a dead toilet seat into eternity, blood in his all-American blond hair. I CONFESS.\\n\\n He swept the letters up and heard himself muttering over and over, like a defective record: \u0027Killing me, you people are killing me, let me alone, can\u0027t you see you\u0027re killing me?\u0027\\n\\n He made himself stop. This was no way to behave. Life would go on. One way or another, life would most certainly go on.\\n\\n Johnny started back to the house, wondering what he could do now. Perhaps something would come along. At any rate, he had fulfilled his mother\u0027s prophecy. If God had had a mission for him, then he had done it. No matter now that it had been a kamikaze mission, He had done it.\\n\\n He was quits. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-17.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
