{"id":93650,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"1.\\n\\n Herb and Vera Smith went back to Pownal and took up the embroidery of their days. Herb finished a house in Durham that December. Their savings did indeed melt away, as Sarah had foreseen, and they applied to the state for Extraordinary Disaster Assistance. That aged Herb almost as much as the accident itself had done. EDA was only a fancy way of saying \u0027welfare\u0027 or \u0027charity\u0027 in his mind. He had spent a lifetime working hard and honestly - with his hands and had thought he would never see the day when he would have to take a state dollar. But here that day was.\\n\\n Vera subscribed to three new magazines which came through the mail at irregular intervals. All three were badly printed and might have been illustrated by talented children. God\u0027s Saucers, The Coming Transfiguration, and God\u0027s Psychic Miracles. The Upper Room, which still came monthly, now sometimes lay unopened for as long as three weeks at a stretch, but she read these others to tatters. She found a great many things in them that seemed to bear upon Johnny\u0027s accident, and she read these nuggets to her tired husband at supper in a high, piercing voice that trembled with exaltation. Herb found himself telling her more and more frequently to be quiet, and on occasion shouting at her to shut up that drivel and let him alone. When he did that, she would give him long-suffering, compassionate, and hurt glances - then slink upstairs to continue her studies. She began to correspond with these magazines, and to exchange letters with the contributors and with other pen-friends who had had similar experiences in their lives.\\n\\n Most of her correspondents were good-hearted people like Vera herself, people who wanted to help and to ease the nearly insupportable burden of her pain. They sent prayers and prayer stones, they sent charms, they sent promises to include Johnny in their nightly devotions. Yet there were others who were nothing but con-men and women, and Herb was alarmed by his wife\u0027s increasing inability to recognize these. There was an offer to send her a sliver of the One True Cross of Our Lord for just $99.98. An offer to send a vial of water drawn from the spring at Lourdes, which would almost certainly work a miracle when rubbed into Johnny\u0027s forehead. That one was $1.10 plus postage. Cheaper (and more attractive to Vera) was a continuously playing cassette tape of the Twenty-third Psalm and the Lord\u0027s Prayer as spoken by southern evangelist Billy Humbair�� Played at Johnny\u0027s bedside over a period of weeks it would almost certainly effect a marvelous recovery, according to the pamphlet.\\n\\n As an added blessing (For A Short Time Only) an autographed picture of Billy Humbarr himself would be included.\\n\\n Herb was forced to step in more and more frequently as her passion for these pseudoreligious geegaws grew. Sometimes he surreptitiously tore up her checks and simply readjusted the checkbook balance upward. But when the offer specified cash and nothing but, he simply had to put his foot down - and Vera began to draw away from him, to view him with distrust as a sinner and an unbeliever.\\n\\n Sarah Bracknell kept school during her days. Her afternoons and evenings were not much different than they had been following the breakup with Dan; she was in a kind of limbo, waiting for something to happen. In Paris, the peace talks were stalled. Nixon had ordered the bombing of Hanoi continued in spite of rising domestic and foreign protests. At a press conference he produced pictures proving conclusively that American planes were surely not bombing North Vietnamese hospitals, but he went everywhere by Army helicopter. The investigation into the brutal rape-murder of a Castle Rock waitress was stalled following the release of a wandering sign painter who had once spent three years in the Augusta State Mental Hospital - against everyone\u0027s expectations, the sign painter\u0027s alibi had turned out to hold water. Janis Joplin was screaming the blues. Paris decreed (for the second year in a row) that hemlines would go down, but they didn\u0027t. Sarah was aware of all these things in a vague way, like voices from another room where some incomprehensible party went on and on.\\n\\n The first snow fell - just a dusting - then a second dusting, and ten days before Christmas there was a storm that closed area schools for the day and she sat home, looking out at the snow as it filled Flagg Street. Her brief thing with Johnny - she could not even properly call it an affair - was part of another season now, and she could feel him beginning to slip away from her. It was a panicky feeling, as if a part of her was drowning. Drowning in days.\\n\\n She read a good deal about head injuries, comas, and brain damage. None of it was very encouraging. She found out there was a girl in a small Maryland town who had been in a coma for six years; there had been a young man from Liverpool, England, who had been struck by a grappling hook while working on the docks and had remained in a coma for fourteen years before expiring. Little by little this brawny young dock-walloper had severed his connections with the world, wasting away, losing his hair, optic nerves degenerating into oatmeal behind his closed eyes, body gradually drawing up into a fetal position as his ligaments shortened. He had reversed time, had become a fetus again, swimming in the placental waters of coma as his brain degenerated. An autopsy following his death had shown that the folds and convolutions of his cerebrum had smoothed out, leaving the frontal and prefrontal lobes almost utterly smooth and blank.\\n\\n Oh, Johnny, it just isn\u0027t fair, she thought, watching the snow fall outside, filling the world up with blank whiteness, burying fallen summer and red-gold autumn. It isn\u0027t fair, they should let you go to whatever there is to go to.\\n\\n There was a letter from Herb Smith every ten days to two weeks - Vera had her pen-friends, and he had his. He wrote in a large, sprawling hand, using an old-fashioned fountain pen. \u0027We are both fine and well. Waiting to see what will happen next as you must be. Yes, I have been doing some reading and I know what you are too kind and thoughtful to\u0027 say in your letter, Sarah. It looks bad. But of course we hope. I don\u0027t believe in God the way Vera does, but I do believe in him after my fashion, and wonder why he didn\u0027t take John outright if he was going to. Is there a reason? No one knows, I guess. We only hope.\u0027\\n\\n In another letter:\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m having to do most of the Xmas shopping this year as Vera has decided Xmas presents are a sinful custom. This is what I mean about her getting worse all the time. She\u0027s always thought it was a holy day instead of a holiday - if you see what I mean - and if she saw me calling it Xmas instead of Christmas I guess she\u0027d \"shoot me for a hoss-thief.\" She was always saying how we should remember it is the birthday of Jesus Christ and not Santa Claus, but she never minded the shopping before. In fact, she used to like it. Now ragging against it is all she talks about, seems like. She gets a lot of these funny ideas from the people she writes back and forth to. Golly I do wish she\u0027d stop and get back to normal. But otherwise we are both fine and well. Herb.\u0027.\\n\\n And a Christmas card that she had wept over a little:\\n\\n \u0027Best to you from both of us this holiday season, and if you\u0027d like to come down and spend Xmas with a couple of \"old fogies\", the spare bedroom is made up. Vera and I are both fine and well. Hope the New Year is better for all of us, and am sure it will be. Herb and Vera.\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t go down to Pownal over the Christmas vacation, partly because of Vera\u0027s continued withdrawal into her own world - her progress into that world could be read pretty accurately between the lines of Herb\u0027s letters - and partly because their mutual tie now seemed so strange and distant to her. The still figure in the Bangor hospital bed had once been seen in close-up, but now she always seemed to be looking at him through the wrong end of memory\u0027s telescope; like the balloon man, he was far and wee. So it seemed best to keep her distance.\\n\\n Perhaps Herb sensed it as well. His letters became less frequent as 1970 became 1971. In one of them he came as close as he could to saying it was time for her to go on with her life, and closed by saying that he doubted a girl as pretty as she was lacked for dates.\\n\\n But she hadn\u0027t had any dates, hadn\u0027t wanted them. Gene Sedecki, the math teacher who had once treated her to an evening that had seemed at least a thousand years long, had begun asking her out indecently soon after Johnny\u0027s accident, and he was a hard man to discourage, but she believed that he was finally beginning to get the point. It should have happened sooner.\\n\\n Occasionally other men would ask her, and one of them, a law student named Walter Hazlett, attracted her quite a bit. She met him at Anne Strafford\u0027s New Year\u0027s Eve party. She had meant only to make an appearance, but she had stayed quite a while, talking primarily to Hazlett. Saying no had been surprisingly hard, but she had, because she understood the source of attraction too well - Walt Hazlett was a tall man with an unruly shock of brown hair and a slanted, half-cynical smile, and he reminded her strongly of Johnny. That was no basis on which to get interested in a man.\\n\\n Early in February she was asked out by the mechanic who worked on her car at the Cleaves Mills Chevron. Again she almost said yes, and then backed away. The man\u0027s name was Arnie Tremont. He was tall, olive-skinned, and handsome in a smiling, predatory way. He reminded her a bit of James Brolin, the second banana on that Dr. Welby program, and even more of a certain Delta Tau Delta named Dan.\\n\\n Better to wait. Wait and see if something was going to happen.\\n\\n But nothing did.\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n In that summer of 1971, Greg Stillson, sixteen years older and wiser than the Bible salesman who had kicked a dog to death in a deserted Iowa dooryard, sat in the back room of his newly incorporated insurance and real estate business in Ridgeway, New Hampshire. He hadn\u0027t aged much in the years between. There was a net of wrinkles around his eyes now, and his hair was longer (but still quite conservative). He was still a big man, and his swivel chair creaked when he moved.\\n\\n He sat smoking a Pall Mall cigarette and looking at the man sprawled comfortably in the chair opposite. Greg was looking at this man the way a zoologist might look at an interesting new specimen.\\n\\n \u0027See anything green?\u0027 Sonny Elliman asked. Elliman topped six feet, five inches. He wore an ancient, grease-stiffened jeans jacket with the arms and buttons cut off. There was no shirt beneath. A Nazi iron cross, black dressed in white chrome, hung on his bare chest. The buckle of the belt running just below his considerable beer-belly was a great ivory skull. From beneath the pegged cuffs of his jeans poked the scuffed, square toes of a pair of Desert Driver boots. His hair was shoulder-length, tangled, and shining with an accumulation of greasy sweat and engine oil. From one earlobe there dangled a swastika earring, also black dressed in white chrome. He spun a coal-scuttle helmet on the tip of one blunt finger. Stitched on the back of his jacket was a leering red devil with a forked tongue. Above the devil was The Devil\u0027s Dozen. Below it: Sonny Elliman, Prez.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Greg Stillson said. \u0027I don\u0027t see anything green, but I do see someone who looks suspiciously like a walking asshole.\u0027\\n\\n Elliman stiffened a little, then relaxed and laughed. In spite of the dirt, the almost palpable body odor, and Nazi regalia, his eyes, a dark green, were not without intelligence and even a sense of humor.\\n\\n \u0027Rank me to the dogs and back, man,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s been done before. You got the power now.\\n\\n \u0027You recognize that, do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure. I left my guys back in the Hamptons, came here alone. Be it on my own head, man.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027But if we should ever catch you in a similar position, you want to hope your kidneys are wearing combat boots.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll chance it,\u0027 Greg said. He measured Elliman. They were both big men. He reckoned Elliman had forty pounds on him, but a lot of it was beer muscle. \u0027I could take you, Sonny.\u0027\\n\\n Elliman\u0027s face crinkled in amiable good humor again. \u0027Maybe. Maybe not. But that\u0027s not the way we play it, man. All that good American John Wayne stuff.\u0027 He leaned forward, as if to impart a great secret. \u0027Me personally, now, whenever I get me a piece of mom\u0027s apple pie, I make it my business to shit on it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Foul mouth, Sonny,\u0027 Greg said mildly.\\n\\n \u0027What do you want with me?\u0027 Sonny asked. \u0027Why don\u0027t you get down to it? You\u0027ll miss your Jaycee\u0027s meeting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Greg said, still serene. \u0027The Jaycees meet Tuesday nights. We\u0027ve got all the time in the world.\u0027\\n\\n Elliman made a disgusted blowing sound.\\n\\n \u0027Now what I thought,\u0027 Greg went on, \u0027is that you\u0027d want something from me.\u0027 He opened his desk drawer and from it took three plastic Baggies of marijuana. Mixed in with the weed were a number of gel capsules. \u0027Found this in your sleeping bag,\u0027 Greg said. \u0027Nasty, nasty, nasty, Sonny. Bad boy. Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars. Go directly to New Hampshire State Prison.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t have any search warrant,\u0027 Elliman said. \u0027Even a kiddy lawyer could get me off, and you know it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know any such thing,\u0027 Greg Stillson said. He leaned back in his swivel chair and cocked his loafers, bought across the state line at L.L. Bean\u0027s in Maine, up on his desk. \u0027I\u0027m a big man in this town, Sonny. I came into New Hampshire more or less on my uppers a few years back, and now I\u0027ve got a nice operation here. I\u0027ve helped the town council solve a couple of problems, including just what to do about all these kids the chief of police catches doing dope ... oh, I don\u0027t mean bad-hats like you, Sonny, drifters like you we know what to do with when we catch them with a little treasure trove like that one right there on my desk ... I mean the nice local kids. Nobody really wants to do anything to them at all, you know? I figured that out for them. Put them to work on community projects instead of sending them to jail, I said. It worked out real good. Now we\u0027ve got the biggest head in the town area coaching Little League and doing a real good job at it.\u0027\\n\\n Elliman was looking bored. Greg suddenly brought his feet down with a crash, grabbed a vase with a UNH logo on the side, and threw it past Sonny Elliman\u0027s nose. It missed him by less than an inch, flew end over end across the room, and shattered against the file cabinets in the corner. For the first time Elliman looked startled. And for just a moment the face of this older, wiser Greg Still-son was the face of the younger man, the dog-bludgeoner.\\n\\n \u0027You want to listen when I talk,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Because what we\u0027re discussing here is your career over the next ten years or so. Now if you don\u0027t have any interest in making a career out of stamping LIVE FREE OR DIE on license plates, you want to listen up, Sonny. You want to pretend this is the first day of school again, Sonny. You want to get it all right the first time. Sonny.\u0027\\n\\n Elliman looked at the smashed fragments of vase, then back at Stillson. His former uneasy calm was being replaced by a feeling of real interest. He hadn\u0027t been really interested in anything for quite a while now. He had made the run for beer because he was bored. He had come by himself because he was bored. And when this big guy had pulled him over, using a flashing blue light on the dashboard of his station wagon, Sonny Elliman had assumed that what he had to deal with was just another small-town Deputy Dawg, protecting his territory and rousting the big bad biker on the modified Harley-Davidson. But this guy was something else. He was\\n\\n He\u0027s crazy! Sonny realized, with dawning delight at the discovery. He\u0027s got two public service awards on his wall, and pictures of him talking to the Rotarians and the Lions, and he\u0027s vice president of this dipshit town\u0027s Jaycees, and next year he\u0027ll be president, and he\u0027s just as crazy as a fucking bedbug!\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027You got my attention.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have had what you might call a checkered career,\u0027 Greg told him. \u0027I\u0027ve been up, but I\u0027ve also been down. I\u0027ve had a few scrapes with the law. What I\u0027m trying to say, Sonny, is that I don\u0027t have any set feelings about you. Not like the other locals. They read in the Union-Leader about what you and your bikie friends are doing over in the Hamptons this summer and they\u0027d like to castrate you with a rusty Gillette razor blade.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the Devil\u0027s Dozen,\u0027 Sonny said. \u0027We came down on a run from upstate New York to get some beach-time, man. We\u0027re on vacation. We\u0027re not into trashing a bunch of honky-tonk bars. There\u0027s a bunch of Hell\u0027s Angels tearing ass, and a chapter of the Black Riders from New Jersey, but you know who it is mostly? A bunch of college kids.\u0027 Sonny\u0027s lip curled. \u0027But the papers don\u0027t like to report that, do they? They\u0027d rather lay the rap on us than on Susie and Jim.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re so much more colorful,\u0027 Greg said mildly. \u0027And William Loeb over at the Union-Leader doesn\u0027t like bike clubs.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That bald-headed creep,\u0027 Sonny muttered.\\n\\n Greg opened his desk drawer and pulled out a flat pint of Leader\u0027s bourbon. \u0027I\u0027ll drink to that,\u0027 he said. He cracked the seal and drank half the pint at a draught. He blew out a great breath, his eyes watering, and held the pint across the desk. \u0027You?\u0027\\n\\n Sonny polished the pint off. Warm fire bellowed up from his stomach to his throat.\\n\\n \u0027Light me up, man,\u0027 he gasped.\\n\\n Greg threw back his head and laughed. \u0027We\u0027ll get along, Sonny. I have a feeling we\u0027ll get along.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you want?\u0027 Sonny asked again, holding the empty pint.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing ... not now. But I have a feeling...\u0027 Greg\u0027s eyes became far away, almost puzzled. \u0027I told you I\u0027m a big man in Ridgeway. I\u0027m going to run for mayor next time the office comes up, and I\u0027ll win. But that\u0027s Just the beginning?\u0027 Sonny prompted.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a start, anyway.\u0027 That puzzled expression was still there. \u0027I get things done. People know it. I\u0027m good at what I do. I feel like ... there\u0027s a lot ahead of me. Sky\u0027s the limit. But I\u0027m not ... quite ....... what I mean. You know?\u0027\\n\\n Sonny only shrugged.\\n\\n The puzzled expression faded. \u0027But there\u0027s a story, Sonny. A story about a mouse who took a thorn out of a lion\u0027s paw. He did it to repay the lion for not eating him a few years before. You know that story?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I might have heard it when I was a kid,\u0027\\n\\n Greg nodded. \u0027Well, it\u0027s a few years before\u0027 . . whatever it is, Sonny.\u0027 He shoved the plastic Baggies across the desk. \u0027I\u0027m not going to eat you. I could if I wanted to, you know. A kiddie lawyer couldn\u0027t get you off. In this town, with the riots going on in Hampton less than twenty miles away, Clarence Fucking Darrow couldn\u0027t get you off in Ridgeway. These good people would love to see you go up.\\n\\n Elliman didn\u0027t reply, but he suspected Greg was right. There was nothing heavy in his dope stash - two Brown Bombers was the heaviest - but the collective parents of good old Susie and Jim would be glad to see him breaking rocks in Portsmouth, with his hair cut off his head.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not going to eat you,\u0027 Greg repeated. \u0027I hope you\u0027ll remember that in a few years if I get a thorn in my paw ... or maybe if I have a job opportunity for you. Keep it in mind?\u0027\\n\\n Gratitude was not in Sonny Elliman\u0027s limited catalogue of human feelings, but interest and curiosity were. He felt both ways about this man Stillson. That craziness in his eyes hinted at many things, but boredom was not one of them.\\n\\n \u0027Who knows where we\u0027ll all be in a few years?\u0027 he murmured. \u0027We could all be dead, man.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just keep me in mind. That\u0027s all I\u0027m asking.\u0027\\n\\n Sonny looked at the broken shards of vase. \u0027I\u0027ll keep you in mind,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n 1971 passed. The New Hampshire beach riots blew over, and the grumblings of the beachfront entrepreneurs were muted by the increased balances in their bankbooks. An obscure fellow named George McGovern declared for the presidency comically early. Anyone who followed politics knew that the nominee from the Democratic party in 1972 was going to be Edmund Muskie, and there were those who felt he might just wrestle the Troll of San Clemente off his feet and pin him to the mat.\\n\\n In early June, just before school let out for the summer, Sarah met the young law student again. She was in Day\u0027s appliance store, shopping for a toaster, and he had been looking for a gift for his parents\u0027 wedding anniversary. He asked her if she\u0027d like to go to the movies with him -the new Clint Eastwood, Dirty Harry, was in town. Sarah went. And the two of them had a good time. Walter Hazlett had grown a beard, and he no longer reminded her so much of Johnny. In fact, it had become increasingly difficult for her to remember just what Johnny did look like. His face only came dear in her dreams, dreams where he stood in front of the Wheel of Fortune, watching it spin, his face cold and his blue eyes darkened to that perplexing, and a little fearsome, dark violet shade, watching the Wheel as if it were his own private game preserve.\\n\\n She and Walt began to see a lot of each other. He was easy to get along with. He made no demands - or, if he did, they were of such a gradually increasing nature as to be unnoticeable. In October he asked her if he could buy her a small diamond. Sarah asked him if she could have the weekend to think it over. That Saturday night she had gone to the Eastern Maine Medical Center, had gotten a special red-bordered pass at the desk, and had gone up to intensive care. She sat beside Johnny\u0027s bed for an hour. Outside, the fall wind howled in the dark, promising cold, promising snow, promising a season of death. It lacked sixteen days of a year since the fair, the Wheel, and the head-on collision near the Bog.\\n\\n She sat and listened to the wind and looked at Johnny. The bandages were gone. The scar began on his forehead an inch above his right eyebrow and twisted up under the hairline. His hair there had gone white - making her think of that fictional detective in the 87th Precinct stories -Cotton Hawes, his name was. To Sarah\u0027s eyes there seemed to have been no degeneration in him, except for the inevitable weight loss. He was simply a young man she barely knew, fast asleep.\\n\\n She bent over him and kissed his mouth softly, as if the old fairy tale could be reversed and her kiss could wake him. But Johnny only slept.\\n\\n She left, went back to her apartment in Veazie, lay down on her bed and cried as the wind walked the dark world outside, throwing its catch of yellow and red leaves before it. On Monday she told Walt that if he really did want to buy her a diamond - a small one, mind - she would be happy and proud to wear it.\\n\\n That was Sarah Bracknell\u0027s 1971.\\n\\n In early 1972, Edmund Muskie burst into tears during an impassioned speech outside the offices of the man Sonny Elliman had referred to as \u0027that bald-headed creep\u0027. George McGovern upset the primary\u0027, and Loeb announced gleefully in his paper that the people of New Hampshire didn\u0027t like crybabies. In July, McGovern was nominated. In that same month Sarah Bracknell became Sarah Hazlett. She and Walt were married in the First Methodist Churth of Bangor.\\n\\n Less than two miles away, Johnny Smith slept on. And the thought of him came to Sarah, suddenly and horribly, as Walt kissed her in front of the dearly beloved there assembled for the nuptials - Johnny, she thought, and saw him as she had when the lights went on, half Jekyll and half snarling Hyde. She stiffened in Walt\u0027s arms for a moment, and then it was gone. Memory, vision, whatever it had been, it was gone.\\n\\n After long thought and discussion with Walt, she had invited Johnny\u0027s folks to the wedding. Herb had come alone. At the reception, she asked him if Vera was all right.\\n\\n He glanced around, saw they were alone for the moment, and rapidly downed the remainder of his Scotch and soda. He had aged five years in the last eighteen months, she thought. His hair was thinning. The lines on his face were deeper. He was wearing glasses in the careful and self-conscious way of people who have just started wearing them, and behind the mild corrective lenses his eyes were wary and hurt.\\n\\n \"No. she really isn\u0027t, Sarah. The truth is, she\u0027s up in Vermont. On a farm. Waiting for the end of the world.\u0027\\n\\n What?\u0027\\n\\n Herb told her that six months ago Vera had begun to correspond with a group of about ten people who called themselves The American Society of the Last Times. They were led by Mr. and Mrs. Harry L. Stonkers from Racine, Wisconsin. Mr. and Mrs. Stonkers claimed to have been picked up by a flying saucer while they were on a camping trip. They had been taken away to heaven, which was not out in the constellation Orion but on an earth-type planet that circled Arcturus. There they had communed with the society of angels and had seen Paradise. The Stonkerses had been informed that the Last Times were at hand. They were given the power of telepathy and had been sent back to Earth to gather a few fruitful together - for the first shuttle to heaven, as it were. And so the ten of them had gotten together, bought a farm north of St. Johnsbury, and had been settled in there for about seven weeks, waiting for the saucer to come and pick them up.\\n\\n \u0027It sounds...\u0027 Sarah began, and then closed her mouth. \u0027I know how it sounds,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027It sounds crazy. The place cost them nine thousand dollars. It\u0027s nothing but a crashed-in farmhouse with two acres of scrubland. Vera\u0027s share was seven hundred dollars - all she could put up. There was no way I could stop her ... short of committal.\u0027 He paused, then smiled. \u0027But this is nothing to talk about at your wedding party, Sarah. You and your fellow are going to have all the best. I know you will.\u0027\\n\\n Sarah smiled back as best she could. \u0027Thank you, Herb. Will you... I mean, do you think she\u0027ll...\\n\\n \u0027Come back? Oh yes. If the world doesn\u0027t end by winter, I think she\u0027ll be back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I only wish you the best,\u0027 she said, and embraced\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n The farm in Vermont had no furnace, and when the saucer had still not arrived by late October, Vera came home. The saucer had not come, she said, because they were not yet perfect - they had not burned away the nonessential and sinful dross of their lives. But she was uplifted and spiritually exalted. She had had a sign in a dream. She was perhaps not meant to go to heaven in a saucer. She felt more and more strongly that she would be needed to guide her boy, show him the proper way, when he came out of his trance.\\n\\n Herb took her in, loved her as best he could - and life went on. Johnny had been in his coma for two years.\\n\\n 6.\\n\\n Nixon was reinaugurated. The American boys started coming home from Vietnam. Walter Hazlett took his bar exam and was invited to take it again at a later date. Sarah Hazlett kept school while he crammed for his tests. The students who had been silly, gawky freshmen the year she started teaching were now juniors. Flat-chested girls had become bosomy. Shrimps who hadn\u0027t been able to find their way around the building were now playing varsity basketball.\\n\\n The second Arab-Israeli war came and went. The oil boycott came and went. Bruisingly high gasoline prices came and did not go. Vera Smith became convinced that Christ would return from below the earth at the South Pole. This intelligence was based on a new pamphlet (seventeen pages, price $4.50) entitled God\u0027s Tropical Underground. The startling hypothesis of the pamphleteer was that heaven was actually below our very feet, and that the easiest point of ingress was the South Pole. One of the sections of the pamphlet was \u0027Psychic Experiences of the South Pole Explorers\u0027.\\n\\n Herb pointed out to her that less than a year before she had been convinced that heaven was somewhere out There, most probably circling Arcturus. \u0027I\u0027d surely be more apt to believe that than this crazy South Pole stuff,\u0027 he told her. \u0027Mter all, the Bible says heaven\u0027s in the sky. That tropical place below the ground is supposed to be...\\n\\n \u0027Stop it I\u0027 she said sharply, lips pressed into thin white lines. \u0027No need to mock what you don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t mocking, Vera,\u0027 he said quietly.\\n\\n \u0027God knows why the unbeliever mocks and the heathen rages,\u0027 she said. That blank light was in her eyes. They were sitting at the kitchen table, Herb with an old plumbing J.bolt in front of him, Vera with a stack of old National Geographics which she had been gleaning for South Pole pictures and stories. Outside, restless clouds fled west to east and the leaves showered off the trees. It was early October again, and October always seemed to be her worst month. It was the month when that blank light came more frequently to her eyes and stayed longer. And it was always in October that his thoughts turned treacherously to leaving them both. His possibly certifiable wife and his sleeping son, who was probably already dead by any practical definition. Just now he had been turning the J-bolt over in his hands and looking out the window at that restless sky and thinking, I could pack up. Just throw my things into the back of the pickup and go. Florida, maybe. Nebraska. California. A good carpenter can make good money any damn place. Just get up and go.\\n\\n But he knew he wouldn\u0027t. It was just that October was his month to think about running away, as it seemed to be Vera\u0027s month to discover some new pipeline to Jesus and the eventual salvation of the only child she had been able to nurture in her substandard womb.\\n\\n Now he reached across the table and took her hand, which was thin and terribly bony - an old woman\u0027s hand. She looked up, surprised. \u0027I love you very much, Vera,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n She smiled back, and for a glimmering moment she was a great deal like the girl he had courted and won, the girl who had goosed him with a hairbrush on their wedding night. It was a gentle smile, her eyes briefly dear and warm and loving in return. Outside, the sun came out again, sending great shutter-shadows fleeing across their back field.\\n\\n \u0027I know you do, Herbert. And I love you.\u0027\\n\\n He put his other hand over hers and clasped it.\\n\\n \u0027Vera,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Her eyes were so clear ... suddenly she was with him, totally with him, and it made him realize how dread-fully far apart they had grown over the last three years.\\n\\n \u0027Vera, if he never does wake up ... God forbid, but if he doesn\u0027t ... we\u0027ll still have each other, won\u0027t we? I mean...\\n\\n She jerked her hand away. His two hands, which had been holding it lightly, dapped on nothing.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you ever say that. Don\u0027t you ever say that Johnny isn\u0027t going to wake up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All I meant was that we...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course he\u0027s going to wake up,\u0027 she said, looking out the window to the field, where the shadows still crossed and crossed. \u0027It\u0027s God\u0027s plan for him. Oh yes. Don\u0027t you think I know? I know, believe me. God has great things in store for my Johnny. I have heard him in my heart.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Vera,\u0027 he said. \u0027Okay.\u0027\\n\\n Her fingers groped for the National Geographics, found them, and began to turn the pages again.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she said in a childish, petulant voice.\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said quietly.\\n\\n She looked at her magazines. Herb propped his chin in his palms and looked out at the sunshine and shadow and thought how soon winter came after golden, treacherous October. He wished Johnny would die. He had loved the boy from the very first. He had seen the wonder on his tiny face when Herb had brought a tiny tree frog to the boy\u0027s carriage and had put the small living thing in the boy\u0027s hands. He had taught Johnny how to fish and skate and shoot. He had sat up with him all night during his terrible bout with the flu in 1951, when the boy\u0027s temperature had crested at a giddy one hundred and five degrees. He had hidden tears in his hand when Johnny graduated salutatorian of his high school class and had made his speech from memory without a slip. So many memories of him - teaching him to drive, standing on the bow of the Bolero with him when they went to Nova Scotia on vacation one year, Johnny eight years old, laughing and excited by the screwlike motion of the boat, helping him with his homework, helping him with his treehouse, helping him get the hang of his Silva compass when he had been in the Scouts. All the memories were jumbled together in no chronological order at all -Johnny was the single unifying thread, Johnny eagerly discovering the world that had maimed him so badly in the end. And now he wished Johnny would die, oh how he wished it, that he would die, that his heart would stop beating, that the final low traces on the EEG would go flat, that he would just flicker out like a guttering candle in a pool of wax: that he would die and release them.\\n\\n 7.\\n\\n The seller of lightning rods arrived at Cathy\u0027s Roadhouse in Somersworth, New Hampshire, in the early afternoon of a blazing summer\u0027s day less than a week after the Fourth of July in that year of 1973,\u0027 and somewhere not so far away there were, perhaps, storms only waiting to be born in the warm elevator shafts of summer\u0027s thermal updrafts.\\n\\n He was a man with a big thirst, and he stopped at Cathy\u0027s to slake it with a couple of beers, not to make a sale. But from force of long habit, he glanced up at the roof of the low, ranch-style building, and the unbroken line he saw standing against the blistering gunmetal sky caused him to reach back in for the scuffed suede bag that was his sample case.\\n\\n Inside, Cathy\u0027s was dark and cool and silent except for the muted rumble of the color TV on the wall. A few regulars were there, and behind the bar was the owner, keeping an eye on \u0027As The World .Turns\u0027 along with his patrons.\\n\\n The seller of lightning rods lowered himself onto a bar stool and put his sample case on the stool to his left. The owner came over. \u0027Hi, friend. What\u0027ll it be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A Bud,\u0027 the lightning rod salesman said. \u0027And draw another for yourself, if you\u0027re of a mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m always of a mind,\u0027 the owner said. He returned with two beers, took the salesman\u0027s dollar, and left three dimes on the bar. \u0027Bruce Carrick,\u0027 he said, and offered his hand.\\n\\n The seller of lightning rods shook it. \u0027Dohay is the name,\u0027 he said, \u0027Andrew Dohay.\u0027 He drained off half his beer.\\n\\n \u0027Pleased to meet you,\u0027 Carrick said. He wandered off to serve a young woman with a hard face another Tequila Sunrise and eventually wandered back to Dohay. \u0027From out of town?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am,\u0027 Dohay admitted. \u0027Salesman.\u0027 He glanced around. \u0027Is it always this quiet?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It jumps on the weekends and I do a fair trade through the week. Private parties is where we make our dough - if we make it. I ain\u0027t starving, but neither am I driving a Cadillac.\u0027 He pointed a pistol finger at Dohay\u0027s glass. \u0027Freshen that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And another for yourself, Mr. Carrick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bruce.\u0027 He laughed. \u0027You must want to sell me some-thing.\u0027\\n\\n When Carrick returned with the beers the seller of lightning rods said: \u0027I came in to lay the dust, not to sell anything. But now that you mention it...\u0027 He hauled his sample case up onto the bar with a practiced jerk. Things jingled inside it.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, here it comes,\u0027 Carrick said, and laughed.\\n\\n Two of the afternoon regulars, an old fellow with a wart on his right eyelid and a younger man in gray fatigues, wandered over to see what Dohay was selling. The hard-faced woman went on watching \u0027As The World Turns\u0027.\\n\\n Dohay took out three rods, a long one with a brass ball at the tip, a shorter one, and one with porcelain conductors.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell...\u0027 Carrick said.\\n\\n \u0027Lightning rods,\u0027 the old campaigner said, and cackled. \u0027He wants to save this ginmill from God\u0027s wrath, Brucie. You better listen to what he says.\u0027\\n\\n He laughed again, the man in the gray fatigues joined him, Carrick\u0027s face darkened, and the lightning rod salesman knew that whatever chance he had had of making a sale had just flown away. He was a good salesman, good enough to recognize that this queer combination of personalities and circumstances sometimes got together and queered any chance of a deal even before he had a chance to swing into his pitch. He took it philosophically and went into his spiel anyway, mostly from force of habit:\\n\\n \u0027As I was getting out of my car, I just happened to notice that this fine establishment wasn\u0027t equipped with lightning conductors - and that it\u0027s constructed of wood. Now for a very small price - and easy credit terms if you should want them - I can guarantee that...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That lightning\u0027ll strike this place at four this afternoon,\u0027 the man in the gray fatigues said with a grin. The old campaigner cackled.\\n\\n \u0027Mister, no offense,\u0027 Carrick said, \u0027but you see that?\u0027 He pointed to a golden nail on a small wooden plaque beside the TV near the glistening array of bottles. Spiked on the nail was a drift of papers. \u0027All of those things are bills. They got to be paid by the fifteenth of the month. They get written in red ink. Now you see how many people are in here drinking right now? I got to be careful. I got to...\\n\\n \u0027Just my point,\u0027 Dohay broke in smoothly. \u0027You have to be careful. And the purchase of three or four lightning rods is a careful purchase. You\u0027ve got a going concern here. You wouldn\u0027t want it wiped out by one stroke of lightning on a summer\u0027s day, would you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He wouldn\u0027t mind,\u0027 the old campaigner said. \u0027He\u0027d just collect the insurance and go down to Florida. Woon\u0027tchoo, Brucie?\u0027\\n\\n Carrick looked at the old man with distaste.\\n\\n \u0027Well, then, let\u0027s talk about insurance,\u0027 the lightning rod salesman interposed. The man in the gray fatigues had lost interest and had wandered away. \u0027Your fire insurance premiums will go down...\u0027\\n\\n The insurance is all lumped together,\u0027 Carrick said flatly. \u0027Look, I just can\u0027t afford the outlay. Sorry. Now if you was to talk to me again next year...\\n\\n \u0027Well, perhaps I will,\u0027 the lightning rod salesman said, giving up. \u0027Perhaps I will.\u0027 No one thought they could be struck by lightning until they were struck; it was a constant fact of this business. You couldn\u0027t make a fellow like this Carrick see that it was the cheapest form of fire insurance he could buy. But Dohay was a philosopher. After all, he had told the truth when he said he came in to lay the dust.\\n\\n To prove it, and to prove there were no hard feelings, he ordered another beer. But this time he did not match it with one for Carrick.\\n\\n The old campaigner slid onto the stool beside him.\\n\\n \u0027About ten years ago there was a fella got hit by lightning out on the golf course,\u0027 he said. \u0027Killed him just as dead as shit. Now, there\u0027s a man could have used a lightning rod right up on his head, am I right?\u0027 He cackled, sending out a lot of stale beer-breath into Dohay\u0027s face. Dohay smiled dutifully. \u0027All the coins in his pockets were fused together. That\u0027s what I heard. Lightning\u0027s a funny thing. Sure is. Now, I remember one time...\\n\\n A funny thing, Dohay thought, letting the old man\u0027s words flow harmlessly over him, nodding in the right places out of instinct. A funny thing, all right, because it doesn\u0027t care who or what it hits. Or when.\\n\\n He finished his beer and went out, carrying his satchelful of insurance against the wrath of God - maybe the only kind ever invented - with him. The heat struck him like a hammerblow, but still he paused for a moment in the mostly deserted parking lot, looking up at the unbroken line of roof-ridge. $19.95, $29.95 tops, and the man couldn\u0027t afford the outlay. He\u0027d save seventy bucks on his combined insurance the first year, but he couldn\u0027t afford the outlay - and you couldn\u0027t tell him different with those clowns standing around yukking it up.\\n\\n Maybe some day he would be sorry.\\n\\n The seller of lightning rods got into his Buick, cranked up the air conditioning, and drove away west toward Concord and Berlin, his sample case on the seat beside him, running ahead of whatever storms might be whistling up the wind behind.\\n\\n 8.\\n\\n In early 1974 Walt Hazlett passed his bar exams. He and Sarah threw a party for all of his friends, her friends, and their mutual friends - more than forty people in all. The beer flowed like water, and after it was over Walt said they could count themselves damn lucky not to have been evicted. When the last of the guests were seen out (at three in the morning), Walt had come back from the door to find Sarah in the bedroom, naked except for her shoes and the diamond chip earrings he had gone into hock to give her for her birthday. They had made love not once but twice before falling into sodden slumber from which they awoke at nearly noon, with paralyzing hangovers. About six weeks later Sarah discovered that she was pregnant. Neither of them ever doubted that conception had occurred on the night of the big party.\\n\\n In Washington, Richard Nixon was being pressed slowly into a corner, wrapped in a snarl of magnetic tapes. In Georgia, a peanut farmer, ex-Navy man and current governor named James Earl Carter had begun talking with a number of close friends about running for the job Mr. Nixon would soon be vacating.\\n\\n In Room 619 of the Eastern Maine Medical Center, Johnny Smith still slept. He had begun to pull into a fetal shape.\\n\\n Dr. Strawns, the doctor who had talked to Herb and Vera and Sarah in the conference room on the day following the accident, had died of burns in late 1973. His house had caught fire on the day. after Christmas. The Bangor fire department had determined that the fire had been caused by a faulty set of Christmas tree ornaments. Two new doctors, Weizak and Brown, interested themselves in Johnny\u0027s case.\\n\\n Four days before Nixon resigned, Herb Smith fell into the foundation of a house he was building in Gray, landed on a wheelbarrow, and broke his leg. The bone was a long time healing, and it never really felt good again. He limped, and on wet days he began to use a cane. Vera prayed for him, and insisted that he wrap a cloth that had been personally blessed by the Reverend Freddy Coltsmore of Bessemer, Alabama, around the leg each night when he went to bed. The price of the Blessed Coltsmore Cloth (as Herb called it) was $35. It did no good that he was aware of.\\n\\n In the middle of October, shortly after Gerald Ford had pardoned the ex-president, Vera became sure that the world was going to end again. Herb realized what she was about barely in time; she had made arrangements to give what little cash and savings they had recouped since Johnny\u0027s accident to the Last Times Society of America. She had tried to put the house up for sale, and had made an arrangement with the Goodwill, which was going to send a van out in two days\u0027 time to pick up all the furniture. Herb found out when the realtor called him to ask if a prospective buyer could come and look at the house that afternoon.\\n\\n For the first time he had genuinely lost his temper with Vera.\\n\\n \u0027What in Christ\u0027s name did you think you were doing?\u0027 he roared, after dragging the last of the incredible story out of her. They were in the living room. He had just finished calling Goodwill to tell them to forget the van. Outside, rain fell in monotonous gray sheets.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t blaspheme the name of the Savior, Herbert.\\n\\n \u0027Shut up! Shut up! I\u0027m tired of listening to you rave about that crap!\u0027\\n\\n She drew in a startled gasp.\\n\\n He limped over to her, his cane thumping the floor in counterpoint. She flinched back a little in her chair and then looked up at him with that sweet martyr\u0027s expression that made him want, God forgive him, to bust her one across the head with his own damn walking stick.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re not so far gone that you don\u0027t know what you\u0027re doing,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t have that excuse. You snuck around behind my back, Vera.You...\\n\\n \u0027I did not! That\u0027s a lie! I did no such...\\n\\n \u0027You did!\u0027 he bellowed. \u0027Well, you listen to me, Vera. This is where I\u0027m drawing the line. You pray all you want. Praying\u0027s free. Write all the letters you want, a stamp still only costs thirteen cents. If you want to take a bath in all the cheap, shitty lies those Jesusiumpers tell, if you want to go on with the delusions and the make-believe, you go on. But I\u0027m not a part of it. Remember that. Do you understand me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you understand me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think I\u0027m crazy!\u0027 she shouted at him, and her face crumpled and squeezed together in a terrible way. She burst into the braying, ugly tears of utter defeat and disillusion.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said more quietly. \u0027Not yet. But maybe it\u0027s time for a little plain talk, Vera, and the truth is, I think you will be if you don\u0027t pull out of this and start facing reality.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll see,\u0027 she said through her team. \u0027You\u0027ll see. God knows the truth but waits.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just as long as you understand that he\u0027s not going to have our furniture while he\u0027s waiting,\u0027 Herb said grimly. \u0027As long as we see eye to eye on that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Last Times!\u0027 she told him. \u0027The hour of the Apocalypse is at hand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah? That and fifteen cents will buy you a cup of coffee, Vera.\u0027\\n\\n Outside the rain fell in steady sheets. That was the year Herb turned fifty-two, Vera fifty one, and Sarah Hazlett twenty-seven.\\n\\n Johnny had been in his coma for four years.\\n\\n 9.\\n\\n The baby came on Halloween night. Sarah\u0027s labor lasted nine hours. She was given mild whiffs of gas when she needed them, and at some point in her extremity it occurred to her that she was in the same hospital as Johnny, and she called his name over and over again. Afterward she barely remembered this, and certainly never told Walt. She thought she might have dreamed it.\\n\\n The baby was a boy. They named him Dennis Edward Hazlett. He and his mother went home three days later, and Sarah was teaching again after the Thanksgiving holiday. Walt had landed what looked like a fine job with a Bangor firm of lawyers, and if all went well they planned for Sarah to quit teaching in June of 1975. She wasn\u0027t all that sure she wanted to. She had grown to like it.\\n\\n 10.\\n\\n On the first day of 1975, two small boys, Charlie Norton and Norm Lawson, both of Otisfield, Maine, were in the Nortons\u0027 back yard, having a snowball fight. Charlie was eight, Norm was nine. The day was overcast and drippy.\\n\\n Sensing that the end of the snowball fight was nearing - it was almost time for lunch - Norm charged Charlie, throwing a barrage of snowballs. Ducking and laughing, Charlie was at first forced back, and then turned tail and ran, jumping the low stone wall that divided the Norton back yard from the woods. He ran down the path that led toward Strimmer\u0027s Brook. As he went, Norm caught him a damn good one on the back of the hood.\\n\\n Then Charlie disappeared from sight.\\n\\n Norm jumped the wall and stood there for a moment, looking into the snowy woods and listening to the drip of melt-water from the birches, pines, and spruces.\\n\\n \u0027Come on back, chicken!\u0027 Norm called, and made a series of high gobbling sounds.\\n\\n Charlie didn\u0027t rise to the bait. There was no sign of him now, but the path descended steeply as it went down toward the brook. Norm gobbled again and shifted irresolutely from one foot to the other. These were Charlie\u0027s woods, not his. Charlie\u0027s territory. Norm loved a good snowball fight when he was winning, but he didn\u0027t really want to go down there if Charlie was lying in ambush for him with half a dozen good hard slushballs all ready to go.\\n\\n Nonetheless he had taken half a dozen steps down the path when a high, breathless scream rose from below.\\n\\n Norm Lawson went as cold as the snow his green gum-rubber boots were planted in. The two snowballs he had been holding dropped from his hands and plopped to the ground. The scream rose again, so thin it was barely audible.\\n\\n Jeepers-creepers, he went and fell in the brook, Norm thought, and that broke the paralysis of his fear. He ran down the path, slipping and sliding, falling right on his can once. His heartbeat roared in his ears. Part of his mind saw him fishing Charlie from the brook just before he went down for the third time and getting written up in Boys\u0027 Life as a hero.\\n\\n Three-quarters of the way down the slope the path dog-legged, and when he got around the corner he saw that Charlie Norton hadn\u0027t fallen in Strimmer\u0027s Brook after all. He was standing at the place where the path levelled out, and he was staring at something in the melting snow. His hood had fallen back and his face was nearly as white as the snow itself. As Norm approached, he uttered that horrible gasping out-of-breath scream again.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Norm asked, approaching. \u0027Charlie, what\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n Charlie turned to him, his eyes huge, his mouth gaping. He tried to speak but nothing came out of his mouth but two inarticulate grunts and a silver cord of saliva. He pointed instead.\\n\\n Norm came closer and looked. Suddenly all the strength went out of his legs and he sat down hard. The world swam around him.\\n\\n Protruding from the melting snow were two legs clad in blue jeans. There was a loafer on one foot, but the other was bare, white, and defenseless. One arm stuck out of the snow, and the hand at the end of it seemed to plead for a rescue that had never come. The rest of the body was still mercifully hidden.\\n\\n Charlie and Norm had discovered the body of seventeen-year old Carol Dunbarger, the fourth victim of the Castle Rock Strangler.\\n\\n It had been almost two years since he had last killed, and the people of Castle Rock (Strimmer\u0027s Brook formed the southern borderline between the towns of Castle Rock and Otisfield) had begun to relax, thinking the nightmare was finally over.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-6.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
