{"id":93655,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"1. The doctor put Vera Smith on a blood-pressure drug called Hydrodiural. It didn\u0027t lower her blood pressure much (\u0027not a dime\u0027s worth,\u0027 she was fond of writing in her letters), but it did make her feel sick and weak. She had to sit down and rest after vacuuming the floor. Climbing a flight of stairs made her stop at the top and pant like a doggy on a hot August afternoon. If Johnny hadn\u0027t told her it was for the best, she would have thrown the pills out the window right then. The doctor tried her on another drug, and that made her heart race so alarmingly that she did stop taking it. \u0027This is a trial-and-error procedure,\u0027 the doctor said. \u0027We\u0027ll get you fixed up eventually, Vera. Don\u0027t worry. \u0027I don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027My faith is in the Lord God.\u0027 \u0027Yes, of course it is. Just as it should be, too.\u0027 By the end of June, the doctor had settled on a combination of Hydrodiural and another drug called Aldomet fat, yellow, expensive pills, nasty things. When she started taking the two drugs together, it seemed like she had to make water every fifteen minutes. She had headaches. She had heart palpitations. The doctor said her blood pressure was down into the normal range again, but she didn\u0027t believe him. What good were doctors, anyway? Look what they were doing to her Johnny, cutting him up like butcher\u0027s meat, three operations already, he looked like a monster with stitches all over his arms and legs and neck, and he still couldn\u0027t get around without one of those walkers, like old Mrs. Sylvester had to use. If her blood pressure was down, why did she feel so crummy all the time? \u0027You\u0027ve got to give your body time enough to get used to the medication,\u0027 Johnny said. It was the first Saturday in July, and his parents were up for the weekend. Johnny had just come back from hydrotherapy, and he looked pale and haggard. In each hand he held a small lead ball, and he was raising them and then lowering them into his lap as ,they talked, flexing his elbows, building up his biceps and triceps. The healing scars which ran like slashmarks across his elbows and forearms expanded and contracted. \u0027Put your faith in God, Johnny,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027There\u0027s no need of all this foolishness. Put your faith in God and he\u0027ll help you.\u0027 \u0027Vera...\u0027 Herb began. \u0027Don\u0027t you Vera me. This is foolishness! Doesn\u0027t the Bible say, ask and it shall be given, knock and it shall be opened unto you? There\u0027s no need for me to take that evil medicine and no need for my boy to let those doctors go on torturing him. It\u0027s wrong, it\u0027s not helping, and it\u0027s sinful!\u0027 Johnny put the balls of lead shot on the bed. The muscles in his arms were trembling. He felt sick to his stomach and exhausted and suddenly furious at his mother. \u0027The Lord helps those who help themselves,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t want the Christian God at all, Mom. You want a magic genie that\u0027s going to come out of a bottle and give you three wishes.\u0027 \u0027Johnny!\u0027 \u0027Well, it\u0027s true.\u0027 \u0027Those doctors put that idea in your head! All of these crazy ideas I\u0027 Her lips were trembling; her eyes wide but tearless. \u0027God brought you out of that coma to do his will, John. These others, they\u0027re just... \u0027Just trying to get me back on my feet so I won\u0027t have to do God\u0027s will from a wheelchair the rest of my life.\u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s not have an argument,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Families shouldn\u0027t argue.\u0027 And hurricanes shouldn\u0027t blow, but they do every year, and nothing he could say was going to stop this. It had been coming. \u0027If you put your trust in God, Johnny...\u0027 Vera began, taking no notice of Herb at all. \u0027I don\u0027t trust anything anymore.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry to hear you say that,\u0027 she said. Her voice was stiff and distant. \u0027Satan\u0027s agents are everywhere. They\u0027ll try to turn you from your destiny. Looks like they are getting along with it real well.\u0027 \u0027You have to make some kind of... of eternal thing out of it, don\u0027t you? I\u0027ll tell you what it was, it was a stupid accident. a couple of kids were dragging and I just happened to get turned into dog meat. You know what I want, Mom? I want to get out of here. That\u0027s all I want. And I want you to go on taking your medicine and and try to get your feet back on the ground. That\u0027s all I want.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m leaving.\u0027 She stood up. Her face was pale and drawn. \u0027I\u0027ll pray for you, Johnny.\u0027 He looked at her helpless, frustrated, and unhappy. His anger was gone. He had taken it out on her. \u0027Keep taking your medicine! \u0027he said. \u0027I pray that you\u0027ll see the light.\u0027 She left the room, her face set and as grim as stone. Johnny looked helplessly at his father. \u0027John, I wish you hadn\u0027t done that,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027I\u0027m tired. It doesn\u0027t do a thing for my judgment. Or my temper.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Herb said. He seemed about to say more and didn\u0027t. \u0027Is she still planning to go out to California for that flying saucer symposium or whatever it is?\u0027 \u0027Yes. But she may change her mind. You never know from one day to the next, and it\u0027s still a month away.\u0027 \u0027You ought to do something.\u0027 \u0027Yeah? What? Put her away? Commit her?\u0027 Johnny shook his head. \u0027I don\u0027t know. But maybe it\u0027s time you thought about that seriously instead of just acting like it\u0027s out of the question. She\u0027s sick. You have to see that.\u0027 Herb said loudly: \u0027She was all right before you... Johnny winced, as if slapped. Look, I\u0027m sorry. John, I didn\u0027t mean that.\u0027 \u0027Okay, Dad.\u0027 \u0027No, I really didn\u0027t.\u0027 Herb\u0027s face was a picture of misery. \u0027Look, I ought to go after her. She\u0027s probably leafleting the hallways by now.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 \u0027Johnny, just try to forget this and concentrate on getting well. She does love you, and so do I. Don\u0027t be hard on us.\u0027 \u0027No. It\u0027s all right, dad.\u0027 Herb kissed Johnny\u0027s cheek. \u0027I have to go after her.\u0027 \u0027All right.\u0027 Herb left. When they were gone, Johnny got up and tottered the three steps between his chair and the bed. Not much. But something. A start, He wished more than his father knew that he hadn\u0027t blown up at his mother like that. He wished it because an odd sort of certainty was growing in him that his mother was not going to live much longer. 2. Vera stopped taking her medication. Herb talked to her, then cajoled, finally demanded. It did no good. She showed him the letters of her \u0027correspondents in Jesus\u0027, most of them scrawled and full of misspellings, all of them supporting her stand and promising to pray for her. One of them was from a lady in Rhode Island who had also been at the farm in Vermont, waiting for the end of the world (along with her pet Pomeranian, Otis). \u0027GOD is the best medicine,\u0027 this lady wrote, \u0027ask GOD and YOU WILL BE HEALED, not DRS who OSURP the POWER of GOD, it is DRS who have caused all the CANCER in this evil world with there DEVIL\u0027S MEDDLING, anyone who has had SURGERY for instance, even MINOR like TONSILS OUT, sooner or later they will end up with CANCER, this is a proven fact, so ask GOD, pray GOD, merge YOUR WILL with HIS WILL and YOU WILL BE HEALED!!\u0027 Herb talked to Johnny on the phone, and the next day Johnny called his mother and apologized for being so short with her. He asked her to please start taking the medicine again - for him. Vera accepted his apology, but refused to go back to the medication. If God needed her treading the earth, then he would see she continued to tread it. If God wanted to call her home, he would do that even if she took a barrel of pills a day. It was a seamless argument, and Johnny\u0027s only possible rebuttal was the one that Catholics and Protestants alike have rejected for eighteen hundred years: that God works His will through the mind of man as well as through the spirit of man. \u0027Momma,\u0027 he said, \u0027haven\u0027t you thought that God\u0027s will was for some doctor to invent that drug so you could live longer? Can\u0027t you even consider that idea?\u0027 Long distance was no medium for theological argument. She hung up. The next day Marie Michaud came into Johnny\u0027s room, put her head on his bed, and wept. \u0027Here, here,\u0027 Johnny said, startled and alarmed. \u0027What\u0027s this? What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 \u0027My boy,\u0027 she said, still crying. \u0027My Mark. They operated on him and it was just like you said. He\u0027s fine. He\u0027s going to see out of his bad eye again. Thank God.\u0027 She hugged Johnny and he hugged her back as best he could. With her warm tears on his own cheek, he thought that whatever had happened to him wasn\u0027t all bad. Maybe some things should be told, or seen, or found again. It wasn\u0027t even so farfetched to think that God was working through him, although his own concept of God was fuzzy and ill-defined. He held Marie and told her how glad he was. He told her to remember that he wasn\u0027t the one who had operated on Mark, and that he barely remembered what it was that he had told her. She left shortly after that, drying her eyes as she went, leaving Johnny alone to think. 3. Early in August, Dave Pelsen came to see Johnny. The Cleaves Mills High assistant principal was a small, neat man who wore thick glasses and Hush Puppies and a series of loud sports jackets. Of all the people who came to see Johnny during that almost endless summer of 1975, Dave had changed the least. The gray was speckled a little more fully through his hair, but that was all. \u0027So how are you doing? Really?\u0027 Dave asked, when they had finished the amenities. \u0027Not so bad,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I can walk alone now if I don\u0027t overdo it. I can swim six laps in the pool. I get headaches sometimes, real killers, but the doctors say I can expect that to go on for some time. Maybe the rest of my life.\u0027 \u0027Mind a personal question?\u0027 \u0027If you\u0027re going to ask me if I can still get it up,\u0027 Johnny said with a grin, \u0027that\u0027s affirmative.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s good to know, but what I wanted to know about is the money. Can you pay for this?\u0027 Johnny shook his head. \u0027I\u0027ve been in the hospital for going on five years. No one but a Rockefeller could pay for that. My father and mother got me into some sort of state-funded program. Total Disaster, or something like that.\u0027 Dave nodded. \u0027The Extraordinary Disaster program. I figured that. But how did they keep you out of the state hospital, Johnny? That place is the pits.\u0027 \u0027Dr. Weizak and Dr. Brown saw to that. And they\u0027re largely responsible for my having been able to come back as far as I have. I was a ... a guinea pig, Dr. Weizak says. How long can we keep this comatose man from turning into a total vegetable? The physical therapy unit was working on me the last two years I was in coma. I had megavitamin shots ... my ass still looks like a case of smallpox. Not that they expected any return on the project from me personally. I was assumed to be a terminal case almost from the time I came in. Weizak says that what he and Brown did with me is aggressive life support\". He thinks it\u0027s the beginning of a response to all the criticism about sustaining life after hope of recovery is gone. Anyway, they couldn\u0027t continue to use me if I\u0027d gone over to the state hospital, so they kept me here. Eventually, they would have finished with me and then I would have gone to the state hospital.\u0027 \u0027Where the most sophisticated care you would have gotten would have been a turn every six hours to prevent bedsores,\u0027 Dave said. \u0027And if you\u0027d waked up in 1980, you would have been a basket case.\u0027 \u0027I think I would have been a basket case no matter what,\u0027 Johnny said. He shook his head slowly. \u0027I think if someone proposes one more operation on me, I\u0027ll go nuts. And I\u0027m still going to have a limp and I\u0027ll never be able to turn my head all the way to the left.\u0027 \u0027When are they letting you out?\u0027 \u0027In three weeks, God willing.\u0027 \u0027Then what?\u0027 Johnny shrugged. \u0027I\u0027m going down home, I guess. To Pownal. My mother\u0027s going to be in California for a while on a ... a religious thing. Dad and I can use the time to get reacquainted. I got a letter from one of the big literary agents in New York... well, not him, exactly, but one of his assistants. They think there might be a book in what happened to me. I thought I\u0027d try to do two or three chapters and an outline, maybe this guy or his assistants can sell it. The money would come in pretty damn handy, no kidding there.\u0027 \u0027Has there been any other media interest?\u0027 \u0027Well, the guy from the Bangor Daily News who did that original story... \u0027Bright? He\u0027s good.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027d like to come down to Pownal after I blow this joint and do a feature story. I like the guy; but right now I\u0027m holding him off. There\u0027s no money in it for me, and right now, frankly, that\u0027s what I\u0027m looking for. I\u0027d go on \"To Tell the Truth\" if I thought I could make two hundred bucks out of it. My folks\u0027 savings are gone. They sold their car and bought a clunker. Dad took a second mortgage on the house when he should have been thinking about retiring and selling it and living on the proceeds.\u0027 \u0027Have you thought about coming back into teaching?\u0027 Johnny glanced up. \u0027Is that an offer?\u0027 \u0027It ain\u0027t chopped liver.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m grateful,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027But I\u0027m just not going to be ready in September, Dave.\u0027 \u0027I wasn\u0027t thinking about September. You must remember Sarah\u0027s friend, Anne Strafford?\u0027 Johnny nodded. \u0027Well, she\u0027s Anne Beatty now, and she\u0027s going to have a baby in December. So we need an English teacher second semester. Light schedule. Four classes, one senior study hall, two free periods.\u0027 \u0027Are you making a firm offer, Dave?\u0027 \u0027Firm.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s pretty damn good of you,\u0027 Johnny said hoarsely. \u0027Hell with that,- Dave said easily. \u0027You were a pretty damn good teacher.\u0027 \u0027Can I have a couple of weeks to think it over?\u0027 \u0027Until the first of October, if you want,\u0027 Dave said. \u0027You\u0027d still be able to work on your book, I think. If it looks like there might be a possibility there.\u0027 Johnny nodded. \u0027And you might not want to stay down there in Pownal too long,\u0027 Dave said. \u0027You might find it ... uncomfortable.\u0027 Words rose to Johnny\u0027s lips and he had to choke them off. Not for long, Dave. You see, my mother\u0027s in the process of blowing her brains out right now. She\u0027s just not using a gun. She\u0027s going to have a stroke. She\u0027ll be dead before Christmas unless my father and I can persuade her to start taking her medicine again, and I don\u0027t think we can. And I\u0027m a part of it - how much of a part I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think I want to know. Instead he replied, \u0027News travels, huh?\u0027 Dave shrugged. \u0027I understand through Sarah that your mother has had problems adjusting. She\u0027ll come around, Johnny. In the meantime, think about it.\u0027 \u0027I will. In fact, I\u0027ll give you a tentative yes right now. It would be good to teach again. To get back to normal.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re my man,\u0027 Dave said. After he left, Johnny lay down on his bed and looked out the window. He was very tired. Get back to normal Somehow he didn\u0027t think that was ever really going to happen. He felt one of his headaches coming on. 4. The fact that Johnny Smith had come out of his coma with something extra finally did get into the paper, and it made page one under David Bright\u0027s byline. It happened less than a week before Johnny left the hospital. He was in physical therapy, lying on his back on a floorpad. Resting on his belly was a twelve-pound medicine ball. His physical therapist, Eileen Magown, was standing above him and counting off situps. He was supposed to do ten of them, and he was currently struggling over number eight. Sweat was streaming down his face, and the healing scars on his neck stood out bright red, Eileen was a small, homely woman with a whipcord body, a nimbus of gorgeous, frizzy red hair, and deep green eyes flecked with hazel. Johnny sometimes called her - with a mixture of irritation and amusement - the world\u0027s smallest Marine D.I. She had ordered and cajoled and demanded him back from a bed-fast patient who could barely hold a glass of water to a man who could walk without a cane, do three chinups at a time, and do a complete turn around the hospital pool in fifty-three seconds - not Olympic time, but not bad. She was unmarried and lived in a big house on Center Street in Old-town with her four cats. She was slate-hard and she wouldn\u0027t take no for an answer. Johnny collapsed backward. \u0027Nope,\u0027 he panted. \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t think so, Eileen.\u0027 \u0027Up. boy!\u0027 she cried in high and sadistic good humor. \u0027Up! Up! Just three more and you can have a Coke!\u0027 \u0027Give me my ten-pound ball and I\u0027ll give you two more.\u0027 \u0027That ten-pound ball is going into the Guinness Book of Records as the world\u0027s biggest suppository if you don\u0027t give me three more. Up!\u0027 \u0027Urrrrrrgrah!\u0027 Johnny cried, jerking through number eight. He flopped back down, then jerked up again. \u0027Great! \u0027Eileen cried. \u0027One more, one more!\u0027 \u0027OOOOARRRRRRRRUNCH!\u0027 Johnny screamed, and sat up for the tenth time. He collapsed to the mat, letting the medicine ball roil away. \u0027I ruptured myself, are you happy. all my guts just came loose, they\u0027re floating around inside me, I\u0027ll sue you, you goddam harpy.\u0027 \u0027Jeez, what a baby,\u0027 Eileen said, offering him her hand. \u0027This is nothing compared to what I\u0027ve got on for next time.\u0027 \"Forget it,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027All I I\u0027m gonna do next time is swim in the...\u0027 He looked at her, an expression of surprise spreading over his face. His grip tightened on her hand until it was almost painful. \u0027Johnny? What\u0027s wrong? Is it a charley horse?\u0027 \u0027Oh gosh,\u0027 Johnny said mildly. \u0027Johnny?\u0027 He was still gripping her hand, looking into her face with\u0027 a faraway, dreamy contemplation that made her feel nervous. She had heard things about Johnny Smith, rumors that she had disregarded with her own brand of hard-headed pragmatism. There was a story that he had predicted Marie Michaud\u0027s boy was going to be all right, even before the doctors were one hundred percent sure they wanted to try the risky operation. Another rumor had something to do with Dr. Weizak; it was said Johnny had told him his mother was not dead but living someplace on the West Coast under another name. As far as Eileen Magown was concerned, the stories were so much eyewash. on a par with the confession magazines and sweet-savage love stories so many nurses read on station. But the way he was looking at her now made her feel afraid. It was as if he was looking inside her. \u0027Johnny, are you okay?\u0027 They were alone in the physical therapy room. The big double doors with the frosted glass panels which gave on the pool area were closed. \u0027Gosh sakes,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027You better ... yes, there\u0027s still time. Just about.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 He snapped out of it then. He let go of her hand but he had gripped it tightly enough to leave white indentations along the back. \u0027Call the fire department,\u0027 he said. \u0027You forgot to turn off the burner. The curtains are catching on fire.\u0027 \u0027What...?\u0027 \u0027The burner caught the dish towel and the dish towel caught the curtains,\u0027 Johnny said impatiently. \u0027Hurry up and call them. Do you want your house to burn down?\u0027 \u0027Johnny, you can\u0027t know... \u0027Never mind what you can\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said, grabbing her elbow. He got her moving and they walked across to the doors. Johnny was limping badly on his left leg, as he always did when he was tired. They crossed the room that housed the swimming pool, their heels clacking hollowly on the tiles, then went out into the first floor hallway and down to the nurses\u0027 station. Inside, two nurses were drinking coffee and a third was on the phone, telling someone on the other end how she had redone her apartment. \u0027Are you going to call or should I?\u0027 Johnny asked. Eileen\u0027s mind was in a whirl. Her morning routine was as set as a single person\u0027s is apt to be. She had gotten up and boiled herself a single egg while she ate a whole grapefruit, unsweetened, and a bowl of All-Bran. After breakfast she had dressed and driven to the hospital. Had she turned off the burner? Of course she had. She couldn\u0027t specifically remember doing it, but it was habit. She must have. \u0027Johnny, really, I don\u0027t know where you got the idea...\u0027 \u0027Okay, I will.\u0027 They were in the nurses\u0027 station now, a glassed in booth furnished with three straight-backed chairs and a hot plate. The little room was dominated by the callboard -rows of small lights that flashed red when a patient pushed his call button. Three of them were flashing now. The two nurses went on drinking their coffee and talking about some doctor who had turned up drunk at Benjamin\u0027s. The third was apparently talking with her beautician. \u0027Pardon me, I have to make a call,\u0027 Johnny said. The nurse covered the phone with her hand. \u0027There\u0027s a pay phone in the lob...\u0027 \u0027Thanks,\u0027 Johnny said, and took the phone out of her hand. He pushed for one of the open lines and dialed 0. He got a busy signal. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with this thing?\u0027 \u0027Hey!\u0027 The nurse who had been talking to her beautician cried. \u0027What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing? Give me that!\u0027 Johnny remembered that he was in a hospital with its own switchboard and dialed 9 for an outside line. Then he redialed the 0. The deposed nurse, her cheeks flaming with anger, grabbed for the phone. Johnny pushed her away. She whirled, saw Eileen, and took a step toward her. \u0027Eileen, what\u0027s with this crazy guy?\u0027 she asked stridently. The other two nurses had put down their coffee cups and were staring gape-mouthed at Johnny. Eileen shrugged uncomfortably. \u0027I don\u0027t know, he just \u0027Operator.\u0027 \u0027Operator, I want to report a fire in Oldtown,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Can you give me the correct number to call, please?\u0027 \u0027Hey,\u0027 one of the nurses said. \u0027Whose house is on fire?\u0027 Eileen shifted her feet nervously. \u0027He says mine is.\u0027 The nurse who had been talking about her apartment to her beautician did a double take. \u0027Oh my God, it\u0027s that guy,\u0027 she said. Johnny pointed at the callboard, where five or six lights were flashing now. \u0027Why don\u0027t you go see what those people want?\u0027 The operator had connected him with the Oldtown Fire Department. \u0027My name is John Smith and I need to report a fire. It\u0027s at...\u0027 He looked at Eileen. \u0027What\u0027s your address?\u0027 For a moment Johnny didn\u0027t think she was going to tell him. Her mouth worked, but nothing came out. The two coffee drinkers had now forsaken their cups and withdrawn to the station\u0027s far corner. They were whispering together like little girls in a grammar school john. Their eyes were wide. \u0027Sir?\u0027 the voice on the other end asked. \u0027Come on,\u0027 Johnny said, \u0027do you want your cats to fry?\u0027 \u0027624 Center Street,\u0027 Eileen said reluctantly. \u0027Johnny, you\u0027ve wigged out.\u0027 Johnny repeated the address into the phone. \u0027It\u0027s in the kitchen.\u0027 \u0027Your name, sir?\u0027 \u0027John Smith. I\u0027m calling from the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor.\u0027 \u0027May I ask how you came by your information?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027d be on the phone the rest of the day. My information is correct. Now go put it out.\u0027 He banged the phone down. .... and he said Sam Weizak\u0027s mother was still...\u0027 She broke off and looked at Johnny. For a moment he felt all of them looking at him, their eyes lying on his skin like tiny, hot weights, and he knew what would come of this and it made his stomach turn. \u0027Eileen,\u0027 he said. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Do you have a friend next door?\u0027 \u0027Yes... Burt and Janice are next door...\u0027 \u0027Either of them home?\u0027 \u0027I guess Janice probably would be, sure. \u0027Why don\u0027t you give her a call?\u0027 Eileen nodded, suddenly understanding what he was getting at. She took the phone from his hand and dialed an 827 exchange number. The nurses stood by watching avidly, as if they had stepped into a really exciting TV program by accident. \u0027Hello? Jan? It\u0027s Eileen. Are you in your kitchen? ... Would you take a look out your window and tell me if everything looks, well, all right over at my place? ... Well, a friend of mine says ... I\u0027ll tell you after you go look, okay?\u0027 Eileen was blushing. \u0027Yes, I\u0027ll wait.\u0027 She looked at Johnny and repeated, \u0027You\u0027ve wigged out, Johnny.\u0027 There was a pause that seemed to go on and on. Then Eileen began listening again. She listened for a long time and then said in a strange, subdued voice totally unlike her usual one: \u0027No, that\u0027s all right, Jan. They\u0027ve been called. No ... I can\u0027t explain right now but I\u0027ll tell you later.\u0027 She looked at Johnny. \u0027Yes, it is funny how I could have known ... but I can explain. At least I think I can. Good-bye.\u0027 She hung up the telephone. They all looked at her, the nurses with avid curiosity, Johnny with only dull certainty. \u0027Jan says there\u0027s smoke pouring out of my kitchen window,\u0027 Eileen said, and all three nurses sighed in unison. Their eyes, wide and somehow accusing, turned to Johnny again. Jury\u0027s eyes, he thought dismally. \u0027I ought to go home,\u0027 Eileen said. The aggressive, cajoling, positive physical therapist was gone, replaced by a small woman who was worried about her cats and her house and her things��.. I don\u0027t know how to thank you, Johnny ... I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t believe you, but...\u0027 She began to weep. One of the nurses moved toward her, but Johnny was there first. He put an arm around her and led her out into the hall. \u0027You really can,\u0027 Eileen whispered. \u0027What they said...\u0027 \u0027You go on,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027m sure it\u0027s going to be fine. There\u0027s going to be some minor smoke and water damage, and that\u0027s all. That movie poster from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, I think you\u0027re going to lose that, but that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027Yes, okay. Thank you. Johnny. God bless you.\u0027 She kissed him on the cheek and then began to trot down the hall. She looked back once, and the expression on her face was very much like superstitious dread. The nurses were lined up against the glass of the nurses\u0027 station, staring at him. Suddenly they reminded him of crows on a telephone line, crows staring down at something bright and shiny, something to be pecked at and pulled apart. \u0027Go on and answer your calls,\u0027 he said crossly, and they. flinched back at the sound of his voice. He began to limp up the hall toward the elevator, leaving them to start the gossip on its way. He was tired. His legs hurt. His hip joints felt as if they had broken glass in them. He wanted to go to bed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-11.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone.
