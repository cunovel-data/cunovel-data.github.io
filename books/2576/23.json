{"id":93667,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"1.\\n\\n Herb Smith took Charlene MacKenzie as his second wife on the afternoon of January 2, 1977, just as planned. The ceremony took place in the Congregational Church at Southwest Bend. The bride\u0027s father, an eighty-year-old gentleman who was almost blind, gave her away. Johnny stood up with his dad and produced the ring flawlessly at the proper moment. It was a lovely occasion.\\n\\n Sarah Hazlett attended with her husband and their son, who was leaving his babyhood behind now. Sarah was pregnant and radiant, a picture of happiness and fulfilment. Looking at her, Johnny was surprised by a stab of bitter jealousy like an unexpected attack of gas. After a few moments it went away, and Johnny went over and spoke to them at the reception following the wedding.\\n\\n It was the first time he had met Sarah\u0027s husband. He was a tall, good-looking man with a pencil-line moustache and prematurely graying hair. His canvass for the Maine state senate had been successful, and he held forth on what the national elections had really meant, and the difficulties of working with an independent governor, while Denny pulled at the leg of his trousers and demanded more drink, Daddy, more drink, more-drink!\\n\\n Sarah said little, but Johnny felt her brilliant eyes on him - an uncomfortable sensation, but somehow not unpleasant. A little sad, maybe.\\n\\n The liquor at the reception flowed freely, and Johnny went two drinks beyond his usual two drink stopping point - the shock of seeing Sarah again, maybe, this time with her family, or maybe only the realization, written on Charlene\u0027s radiant face, that Vera Smith really was gone, and for all time. So when he approached Hector MacKenzie, father of the bride, some fifteen minutes after the Hazletts had left, he had a pleasant buzz on.\\n\\n The old man was sitting in the corner by the demolished remains of the wedding cake, his arthritis-gnarled hands folded over his cane. He was wearing dark glasses. One bow had been mended with black electrician\u0027s tape. Beside him there stood two empty bottles of beer and another that was half-full. He peered closely at Johnny.\\n\\n \u0027Herb\u0027s boy, ain\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\\n\\n A longer scrutiny. Then Hector MacKenzie said, \u0027Boy, you don\u0027t look well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Too many late nights, I guess.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look like you need a tonic. Something to build you up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were in World War I, weren\u0027t you?\u0027 Johnny asked. A number of medals, including a Croix de Guerre, were pinned to the old man\u0027s blue serge suit coat.\\n\\n \u0027Indeed I was,\u0027 MacKenzie said, brightening. \u0027Served under Black Jack Pershing. AEF, 1917 and 18. We went through the mud and the crud. The wind blew and the shit flew. Belleau Wood, my boy. Belleau Wood. It\u0027s just a name in the history books now. But I was there. I saw men die there. The wind blew and the shit flew and up from the trenches came the whole damn crew.\\n\\n \u0027And Charlene said that your boy ... her brother.,.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Buddy. Yep. Would have been your stepuncle, boy. Did we love that boy? I guess we did, His name was Joe, but everyone called him Buddy almost from the day he was born. Charlie\u0027s mother started to die the day the telegram came.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Killed in the war, wasn\u0027t he?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, he was,\u0027 the old man said slowly. \u0027St. Lo, 1944. Not that far from Belleau Wood, not the way we measure things over here, anyway. They ended Buddy\u0027s life with a bullet. The Nazis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m working on an essay,\u0027 Johnny said, feeling a certain drunken cunning at having brought the conversation around to his real object at last, \u0027I\u0027m hoping to sell it to the Atlantic or maybe Harper\u0027s.,.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Writer, are you?\u0027 The dark glasses glinted up at Johnny with renewed interest.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m trying,\u0027 Johnny said. Already he was beginning to regret his glibness. Yes, I\u0027m a writer, I write in my notebooks, after the dark of night has fallen. \u0027Anyway, the essay\u0027s going to be about Hitler,\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hitler? What about Hitler?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well ... suppose ... just suppose you could hop into a time machine and go back to the year 1932. In Germany. And suppose you came across Hitler. Would you kill him or let him live?\u0027\\n\\n The old man\u0027s blank black glasses tilted slowly up to Johnny\u0027s face, And now Johnny didn\u0027t feel drunk or glib or clever at all. Everything seemed to depend on what this old man had to say.\\n\\n \u0027Is it a joke, boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. No joke.\u0027\\n\\n One of Hector MacKenzie\u0027s hands left the head of his cane. It went to the pocket of his suit pants and fumbled there for what seemed an eternity. At last it came out again. It was holding a bone-handled pocket knife that had been rubbed as smooth and mellow as old ivory over the course of years. The other hand came into play, folding the knife\u0027s one blade out with all the incredible delicacy of arthritis. It glimmered with bland wickedness under the light of the Congregational parish hall: a knife that had traveled to France in 1917 with a boy, a boy who had been part of a boy-army ready and willing to stop the dirty hun from bayoneting babies and raping nuns, ready to show the Frenchies a thing or two in the bargain; and the boys had been machine-gunned, the boys had gotten dysentery and the killer flu, the boys had inhaled mustard gas and phosgene gas, the boys had come out of Belleau Wood looking like haunted scarecrows who had seen the face of Lord Satan himself. And it had all turned out to be for nothing; it turned out that it all had to be done over again, Somewhere music was playing. People were laughing. People were dancing. A flashbar popped warm light. Somewhere far away. Johnny stared at the naked blade, transfixed, hypnotized by the play of the light over its honed edge.\\n\\n \u0027See this?\u0027 MacKenzie asked softly.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Johnny breathed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d seat this in his black, lying, murderer\u0027s heart,\u0027 MacKenzie said. \u0027I\u0027d put her in as far as she\u0027d go ... and then I\u0027d twist her.\u0027 He twisted the knife slowly in his hand, first clock, then counterclock. He smiled, showing baby-smooth gums and one leaning yellow tooth.\\n\\n \u0027But first,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027d coat the blade with rat poison.\u0027\\n\\n 2.\\n\\n \u0027Kill Hitler?\u0027 Roger Chatsworth said, his breath coming out in little puffs. The two of them were snowshoeing in the woods behind the Durham house. The woods were very silent. It was early March, but this day was as smoothly and coldly silent as deep January.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Interesting question,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027Pointless, but interesting. No. I wouldn\u0027t. I think I\u0027d join the party instead. Try to change things from within. It might have been possible to purge him or frame him, always granting the foreknowledge of what was going to happen.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny thought of the sawedoff pool cues. He thought of the brilliant green eyes of Sonny Elliman.\\n\\n \u0027It might also be possible to get yourself killed!\u0027 he said. \u0027Those guys were doing more than singing beer-hall songs back in 1933.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s true enough.\u0027 He cocked an eyebrow at Johnny. \u0027What would you do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I really don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n Roger dismissed the subject. \u0027How did your dad and his wife enjoy their honeymoon?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny grinned. They had gone to Miami Beach, hotel-workers\u0027 strike and all. \u0027Charlene said she felt right at home, making her own bed. My dad says he feels like a freak, sporting a sunburn in March. But I think they both enjoyed it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And they\u0027ve sold the houses?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, both on the same day. Got almost what they wanted, too. Now if it wasn\u0027t for the goddam medical bills still hanging over my head, it\u0027d be plain sailing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Johnny...\\n\\n \u0027Hmmm?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. Let\u0027s go back. I\u0027ve got some Chivas Regal, if you\u0027ve got a taste.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I believe I do,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n They were reading Jude the Obscure now, and Johnny had been surprised at how quickly and naturally Chuck had taken to it (after some moaning and groaning over the first forty pages or so). He confessed he had been reading ahead at night on his own, and he intended to try something else by Hardy when he finished. For the first time in his life he was reading for pleasure. And like a boy who has just been initiated into the pleasures of sex by an older woman, he was wallowing in it.\\n\\n Now the book lay open but facedown in his lap. They were by the pool again, but it was still drained and both he and Johnny were wearing light jackets. Overhead, mild white clouds scudded across the sky, trying desultorily to coalesce enough to make rain. The feel of the air was mysterious and sweet; spring was somewhere near. It was April 16.\\n\\n \u0027Is this one of those trick questions?\u0027 Chuck asked.\\n\\n \u0027Nope.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, would they catch me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pardon?\u0027 That was a question none of the others had asked.\\n\\n \u0027If I killed him. Would they catch me? Hang me from a lamppost? Make me do the funky chicken six inches off the ground?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well; I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said slowly. \u0027Yes, I suppose they would catch you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t get to escape in my time machine to a gloriously changed world, huh? Back to good old 1977?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it wouldn\u0027t matter. I\u0027d kill him anyway.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 Chuck smiled a little. \u0027I\u0027d rig myself up with one of those hollow teeth filled with quick-acting poison or a razor blade in my shirt collar or something like that. So if I did get caught they couldn\u0027t do anything too gross to me. But I\u0027d do it. If I didn\u0027t, I\u0027d be afraid all those millions of people he ended up killing would haunt me to my grave.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To your grave,\u0027 Johnny said a little sickly.\\n\\n \u0027Are you okay, Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny made himself return Chuck\u0027s smile. \u0027Fine. I guess my heart just missed a beat or something.\u0027\\n\\n Chuck went on with Jude under the milky cloudy sky.\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n May.\\n\\n The smell of cut grass was back for yet another return engagement - also those long-running favorites, honey. suckle, dust, and roses. In New England spring really only comes for one priceless week and then the deejays drag out the Beach Boys golden oldies, the buzz of the cruising Honda is heard throughout the land, and summer comes down with a hot thud.\\n\\n On one of the last evenings of that priceless spring week, Johnny sat in the guest house, looking out into the night. The spring dark was soft and deep. Chuck was off at the senior prom with his current girl friend, a more intellectual type than the last half-dozen. She reads, Chuck had confided to Johnny, one man of the world to another.\\n\\n Ngo was gone. He had gotten his citizenship papers in late March, had applied for a job as head groundskeeper at a North Carolina resort hotel in April had gone down for an interview three weeks ago, and had been hired on the spot. Before he left, he had come to see Johnny.\\n\\n \u0027You worry too much about tigers that are not there, I think,\u0027 he said. \u0027The tiger has stripes that will fade into the background so he will not be seen. This makes the worried man see tigers everywhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s a tiger,\u0027 Johnny had answered.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Ngo agreed. \u0027Somewhere. In the meantime, you grow thin.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny got up, went to the fridge, and poured himself a Pepsi. He went outside with it to the little deck. He sat down and sipped his drink and thought how lucky everyone was that time travel was a complete impossibility. The moon came up, an orange eye above the pines, and beat a bloody path across the swimming pool. The first frogs croaked and thumped. After a little while Johnny went inside and poured a hefty dollop of Ron Rico into his Pepsi. He went back outside and sat down again, drinking and watching as the moon rose higher in the sky, changing slowly from orange to mystic, silent silver. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-23.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
