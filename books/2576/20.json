{"id":93664,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"1.\\n\\n On a day not long after Chuck\u0027s first breakthrough, Johnny Smith stood in the bathroom of the guest house, running his Norelco over his cheeks. Looking at himself closeup in a mirror always gave him a weird feeling these days, as if he were looking at an older brother instead of himself. Deep horizontal lines had grooved themselves across his forehead. Two more bracketed his mouth. Strangest of all, there was that streak of white, and the rest of his hair was beginning to go gray. It seemed to have started almost overnight.\\n\\n He snapped off the razor and went out into the combination kitchen-living room. Lap of luxury, he thought, and smiled a little. Smiling was starting to feel natural again. He turned on the TV, got a Pepsi out of the fridge, and settled down to watch the news. Roger Chatsworth was due back later in the evening, and tomorrow Johnny would have the distinct pleasure of telling him that his son was beginning to make real progress.\\n\\n Johnny had been up to see his own father every two weeks or so. He was pleased with Johnny\u0027s new job and listened with keen interest as Johnny told him about the Chatsworths, the house in the pleasant college town of Durham, and Chuck\u0027s problems. Johnny, in turn, listened as his father told him about the gratis work he was doing at Charlene MacKenzie\u0027s house in neighboring New Gloucester.\\n\\n \u0027Her husband was a helluva doctor but not much of a handyman,\u0027 Herb said. Charlene and Vera had been friends before Vera\u0027s deepening involvement in the stranger offshoots of fundamentalism. That had separated them. Her husband, a GP, had died of a heart attack in 1973. \u0027Place was practically falling down around that woman\u0027s ears,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Least I could do. I go up on Saturdays and she gives me a dinner before I come back home. I have to tell the truth, Johnny, she cooks better than you do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Looks better, too,\u0027 Johnny said blandly.\\n\\n \u0027Sure, she\u0027s a fine-looking woman, but it\u0027s nothing like that, Johnny. Your mother not even in her grave a year...\\n\\n But Johnny suspected that maybe it was something like that, and secretly couldn\u0027t have been more pleased. He didn\u0027t fancy the idea of his father growing old alone.\\n\\n On the television, Walter Cronkite was serving up the evening\u0027s political news. Now, with the primary season over and the conventions only weeks away, it appeared that Jimmy Carter had the Democratic nomination sewed up. It was Ford who was in a scrap for his political life with Ronald Reagan, the ex-governor of California and ex-host of \u0027GE Theater\u0027. It was close enough to have the reporters counting individual delegates, and in one of her infrequent letters Sarah Hazlett had written: \u0027Walt\u0027s got his fingers (and toes!) crossed that Ford gets in. As a candidate for state senate up here, he\u0027s already thinking about coattails. And he says that, in Maine at least, Reagan hasn\u0027t any.\u0027\\n\\n While he was shortorder cooking in Kittery, Johnny had gotten into the habit of going down to Dover or Portsmouth or any number of smaller towns in New Hampshire a couple of times a week. All of the candidates for president were in and out, and it was a unique opportunity to see those who were running closeup and without the nearly regal trappings bf authority that might later surround any one of them. It became something of a hobby, although of necessity a short-lived one; when New Hampshire\u0027s first-in-the-nation primary was over, the candidates would move on to Florida without a glance back. And of course a few of their number would bury their political ambitions somewhere between Portsmouth and Keene. Never a political creature before -except during the Vietnam era - Johnny became an avid politician-watcher in the healing aftermath of the Castle Rock business - and his own particular talent, affliction, whatever it was, played a part in that, too.\\n\\n He shook hands with Morris Udall and Henry Jackson. Fred Harris clapped him on the back. Ronald Reagan gave him a quick and practiced politico\u0027s double-pump and said, \u0027Get out to the polls and help us if you can.\u0027 Johnny had nodded agreeably enough, seeing no point in disabusing Mr. Reagan of his notion that he was a bona fide New Hampshire voter.\\n\\n He had chatted with Sarge Shriver just inside the main entrance to the monstrous Newington Mall for nearly fifteen minutes. Shriver, his hair freshly cut and smelling of after-shave and perhaps desperation, was accompanied by a single aide with his pockets stuffed full of leaflets, and a Secret Service man who kept scratching furtively at his acne. Shriver had seemed inordinately pleased to be recognized. A minute or two before Johnny said goodbye, a candidate in search of some local office had approached Shriver and asked him to sign his nominating papers. Shriver had smiled gently.\\n\\n Johnny had sensed things about all of them, but little of a specific nature. It was as if they had made the act of touching such a ritual that their true selves were buried beneath a layer of tough, clear lucite. Although he saw most of them - with the exception of President Ford -Johnny had felt only once that sudden, electrifying snap of knowledge that he associated with Eileen Magown -and, in an entirely different way, with Frank Dodd.\\n\\n It was a quarter of seven in the morning. Johnny had driven down to Manchester in his old Plymouth. He had worked from ten the evening before until six this morning. He was tired, but the quiet winter dawn had been too good to sleep through. And he liked Manchester, Manchester with its narrow streets and timeworn brick buildings, the gothic textile mills strung along the river like mid-Victorian beads. He had not been consciously politician-hunting that morning; he thought he would cruise the streets for a while, until they began to get crowded, until the cold and silent spell of February was broken, then go back to Kittery and catch some sacktime.\\n\\n He turned a corner and there had been three nondescript sedans pulled up in front of a shoe factory in a no-parking zone. Standing by the gate in the cyclone fencing was Jimmy Carter, shaking hands with the men and women going on shift. They were carrying lunch buckets or paper sacks, breathing out white clouds, bundled into heavy coats, their faces still asleep. Carter had a word for each of them. His grin, then not so publicized as it became later, was tireless and fresh. His nose was red with the cold.\\n\\n Johnny parked half a block down and walked toward the factory gate, his shoes crunching and squeaking on the packed snow. The Secret Service agent with Carter sized him up quickly and then dismissed him or seemed to.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll vote for anyone who\u0027s interested in cutting taxes,\u0027 a man in an old ski parka was saying. The parka had a constellation of what looked like battery-acid burns in one sleeve. \u0027The goddam taxes are killing me, I kid you not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, we\u0027re gonna see about that,\u0027 Carter said. \u0027Lookin over the tax situation is gonna be one of our first priori-ties when I get into the White House.\u0027 There was a serene self-confidence in his voice that struck Johnny and made him a little uneasy.\\n\\n Carter\u0027s eyes, bright and almost amazingly blue, shifted to Johnny. \u0027Hi there,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Hello, Mr. Carter,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I don\u0027t work here. I was driving by and saw you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well I\u0027m glad you stopped. I\u0027m running for President.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know.\u0027\\n\\n Carter put his hand out. Johnny shook it.\\n\\n Carter began: \u0027I hope you\u0027ll...\u0027 And broke off.\\n\\n The flash came, a sudden, powerful zap that was like sticking his finger in an electric socket. Carter\u0027s eyes sharpened. He and Johnny looked at each other for what seemed a very long time.\\n\\n The Secret Service guy didn\u0027t like it. He moved toward Carter, and suddenly he was unbuttoning his coat. Some-where behind them, a million miles behind them, the shoe factory\u0027s seven o\u0027clock whistle blew its single note into the crisp blue morning.\\n\\n Johnny let go of Carter\u0027s hand, but still the two of them looked at each other.\\n\\n \u0027What the hell was that?\u0027 Carter asked, very softly.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve probably got someplace to go, don\u0027t you?\u0027 the Secret Service guy said suddenly. He put a hand on Johnny\u0027s shoulder. It was a very big hand. \u0027Sure you do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 Carter said.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re going to be president,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n The agent\u0027s hand was still on Johnny\u0027s shoulder, more lightly now but still there, and he was getting something from him, too. The Secret Service guy\\n\\n didn\u0027t like his eyes. He thought they were\\n\\n (assassin\u0027s eyes, psycho\u0027s eyes)\\n\\n cold and strange, and if this guy put so much as one hand in his coat pocket. if he even looked as if he might be going in that direction, he was going to put him on the sidewalk. Behind the Secret Service guy\u0027s second-to-second evaluation of the situation there ran a simple, maddening litany of thought:\\n\\n (laurel maryland laurel maryland laurel maryland laurel)\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Carter said.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s going to be closer than anyone thinks ... closer than you think, but you\u0027ll win. He\u0027ll beat himself. Poland. Poland will beat him.\u0027\\n\\n Carter only looked at him. half-smiling.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got a daughter. She\u0027s going to go to a public school in Washington. She\u0027s going to go to...\u0027 But it was in the dead zone. \u0027I think ... it\u0027s a school named after a freed slave.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fellow, I want you to move on,\u0027 the agent said.\\n\\n Carter looked at him and the agent subsided.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s been a pleasure meeting you,\u0027 Carter said. \u0027A little disconcerting, but a pleasure.\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly, Johnny was himself again. It had passed. He was aware that his ears were cold and that he had to go to the bathroom. \u0027Have a good morning,\u0027 he said lamely.\\n\\n \u0027Yes. You too, now.\u0027\\n\\n He had gone back to his car, aware of the Secret Service guy\u0027s eyes still on him. He drove away, bemused. Shortly after, Carter had put away the competition in New Hampshire and went on to Florida.\\n\\n 2.\\n\\n Walter Cronkite finished with the politicians and went on to the civil war in Lebanon. Johnny got up and freshened his glass of Pepsi. He tipped the glass at the TV. Your good health, Walt. To the three Ds - death, destruction, and destiny. Where would we be without them.\\n\\n There was a light tap at the door. \u0027Come in,\u0027 Johnny called, expecting Chuck, probably with an invitation to the drive-in over in Somersworth. But it wasn\u0027t Chuck. It was Chuck\u0027s father.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, Johnny,\u0027 he said. He was wearing wash4aded jeans and an old cotton sports shirt, the tails out. \u0027May I come in?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure. I thought you weren\u0027t due back until late.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, Shelley gave me a call.\u0027 Shelley was his wife. Roger came in and shut the door. \u0027Chuck came to see her. Burst into tears, just like a little kid. He told her you were doing it, Johnny. He said he thought he was going to be all right.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny put his glass down. \u0027We\u0027ve got a ways to go,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Chuck met me at the airport. I haven\u0027t seen him looking like he did since he was ... what? Ten? Eleven? When I gave him the .22 he\u0027d been waiting for for five years. He read me a story out of the newspaper. The improvement is ... almost eerie. I came over to thank you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank Chuck,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027He\u0027s an adaptable boy.\\n\\n A lot of what\u0027s happening to him is positive reinforcement. He\u0027s psyched himself into believing he can do it and now he\u0027s tripping on it. That\u0027s the best way I can put it.\u0027\\n\\n Roger sat down. \u0027He says you\u0027re teaching him to switch-hit.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny smiled. \u0027Yeah, I guess so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is he going to be able to take the SATs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. And I\u0027d hate to see him gamble and lose. The SATs are a heavy pressure situation. If he gets in that lecture hall with an answer sheet in front of him and an IBM pencil in his hand and then freezes up, it\u0027s going to be a real setback for him. Have you thought about a good prep school for a year? A place like Pittsfield Academy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve kicked the idea around, but frankly I always thought of it as just postponing the inevitable.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s one of the things that\u0027s been giving Chuck trouble. This feeling that he\u0027s in a make-or-break situation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve never pressured Chuck.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not on purpose, I know that. So does he. On the other hand, you\u0027re a rich, successful man who graduated from college sum ma cum laude. I think Chuck feels a little bit like he\u0027s batting after Hank Aaron.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s nothing I can do about that, Johnny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think a year at a prep school, away from home, after his senior year might put things in perspective for him. And he wants to go to work in one of your mills next summer. If he were my kid and if they were my mills, I\u0027d let him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Chuck wants to do that? How come he never told me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because he didn\u0027t want you to think he was ass-kissing,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n \u0027He told you that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. He wants to do it because he thinks the practical experience will be helpful to him later on. The kid wants to follow in your footsteps, Mr. Chatsworth. You\u0027ve left some big ones behind you. That\u0027s what a lot of the reading block has been about. He\u0027s having buck fever.\u0027\\n\\n In a sense, he had lied. Chuck had hinted around these things, and even mentioned some of them obliquely, but he had not been as frank as Johnny had led Roger Chats-worth to believe. Not verbally, at least. But Johnny had touched him from time to time, and he had gotten signals that way. He had looked through the pictures Chuck kept in his wallet and knew how Chuck felt about his dad. There were things he could never tell this pleasant but rather distant man sitting across from him. Chuck idolized the ground his father walked on. Beneath his easy-come easy-go exterior (an exterior that was very similar to Roger\u0027s), the boy was eaten up by the secret conviction that he could never measure up. His father had built a ten percent interest in a failing woolen mill into a New England textile empire. He believed that the issue of his father\u0027s love hung on his own ability to move similar mountains. To play sports. To get into a good college. To read.\\n\\n \u0027How sure are you about all of this?\u0027 Roger asked.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m pretty sure. But I\u0027d appreciate it if you never mentioned to Chuck that we talked this way. They\u0027re his secrets I\u0027m telling.\u0027 And that\u0027s truer than you\u0027ll ever know.\\n\\n \u0027All right. And Chuck and his mother and I will talk over the prep school idea. In the meantime, this is yours. He took out a plain white business envelope from his back pocket and passed it to Johnny.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Open it and see.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny opened it. Inside the envelope was a cashier\u0027s check for five hundred dollars.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, hey... ! I can\u0027t take this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can, and you will. I promised you a bonus if you could perform, and I keep my promises. There\u0027ll be an-other when you leave.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really, Mr. Chatsworth, I just...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh. I\u0027ll tell you something, Johnny.\u0027 He leaned forward. He was smiling a peculiar little smile, and Johnny suddenly felt he could see beneath the pleasant exterior to the man who had made all of this happen - the house, the grounds, the pool, the mills. And, of course, his son\u0027s reading phobia, which could probably be classified a hysterical neurosis.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s been my experience that ninety-five percent of the people who walk the earth are simply inert, Johnny. One percent are saints, and one percent are assholes. The other three percent are the people who do what they say they can do. I\u0027m in that three percent, and so are you. You earned that money. I\u0027ve got people in the mills that take home eleven thousand dollars a year for doing little more than playing with their dicks. But I\u0027m not bitching. I\u0027m a man of the world, and all that means is I under-stand what powers the world. The fuel mix is one part high-octane to nine parts pure bull-shit. You\u0027re no bullshitter. So you put that money in your wallet and next time try to value yourself a little higher.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I can put it to good use, I won\u0027t lie to you about that.\\n\\n \u0027Doctor bills?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny looked up at Roger Chatsworth, his eyes narrowed.\\n\\n \u0027I know all about you,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027Did you think I wouldn\u0027t check back on the guy I hired to tutor my son?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know about...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re supposed to be a psychic of some kind. You helped to solve a murder case in Maine. At least, that\u0027s what the papers say. You had a teaching job lined up for last January, but they dropped you like a hot potato when your name got in the papers.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You knew? For how long?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I knew before you moved in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And you still hired me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wanted a tutor, didn\u0027t I? You looked like you might be able to pull it off. I think I showed excellent judgment in engaging your services.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, thanks,\u0027 Johnny said. His voice was hoarse.\\n\\n \u0027I told you you didn\u0027t have to say that.\u0027\\n\\n As they talked, Walter Cronkite had finished up with the real news of the day and had gone on to the man bites dog stories that sometimes turn up near the end of a newscast. He was saying, ... . voters in western New Hampshire have an independent running in the third district this year.\\n\\n \u0027Well, the cash will come in handy,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027That\u0027s . - -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh. I want to hear this.\u0027\\n\\n Chatsworth was leaning forward, hands dangling between his knees, a pleasant smile of expectation on his face. Johnny turned to look at the TV.\\n\\n ... . Stillson,\u0027 Cronkite said. \u0027This forty-three-year-old insurance and real estate agent is surely running one of the most eccentric races of Campaign \u002776, but both the third-district Republican candidate, Harrison Fisher, and his Democratic opponent, David Bowes, are running scared, because the polls have Greg Stillson running comfortably ahead. George Herman has the story.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s Stillson?\u0027 Johnny asked.\\n\\n Chatsworth laughed. \u0027Oh, you gotta see this guy, Johnny. He\u0027s as crazy as a rat in a drainpipe. But I do believe the sober-sided electorate of the third district is going to send him to Washington this November. Unless he actually falls down and starts frothing at the mouth. And I wouldn\u0027t completely rule that out.\u0027\\n\\n Now the TV showed a picture of a handsome young man in a white open-throated shirt. He was speaking to a small crowd from a bunting-hung platform in a supermarket parking lot. The young man was exhorting the crowd. The crowd looked less than thrilled. George Herman voiced over: \u0027This is David Bowes, the Democratic candidate - sacrificial offering, some would say - for the third-district seat in New Hampshire. Bowes expected an uphill fight because New Hampshire\u0027s third district has never gone Democratic, not even in the great LBJ blitz of 1964. But he expected his competition to come from this man.\u0027\\n\\n Now the TV showed a man of about sixty-five. He was speaking to a plushy fund-raising dinner. The crowd had that plump, righteous, and slightly constipated look that seems the exclusive province of businessmen who belong to the GOP. The speaker bore a remarkable resemblance to Edward Gurney of Florida, although he did not have Gurney\u0027s slim, tough build.\\n\\n \u0027This is Harrison Fisher,\u0027 Herman said. \u0027The voters of the third district have been sending him to Washington every two years since 1960. He is a powerful figure in the house, sitting on five committees and chairing the House Committee on Parks and Waterways. It had been expected that he would beat young David Bowes handily. But neither Fisher nor Bowes counted on a wild card in the deck. This wild card.\\n\\n The picture switched.\\n\\n \u0027Holy God!\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n Beside him, Chatsworth roared laughter and slapped his thighs. \u0027Can you believe that guy?\u0027\\n\\n No lackadaisical supermarket parking-lot crowd here. No comfy fund raiser in the Granite State Room of the Portsmouth Hilton, either. Greg Stillson was standing on a platform outside in Ridgeway, his home town. Be-hind him there loomed the statue of a Union soldier with his rifle in his hand and his kepi tilted down over his eyes. The street was blocked off and crowded with wildly cheering people, predominantly young people. Stillson was wearing faded jeans and a two-pocket Army fatigue shirt with the words GIVE PEACE A CHANCE embroidered on one pocket and MOM\u0027S APPLE PIE on the other. There was a hi-impact construction worker\u0027s helmet cocked at an arrogant, rakish angle on his head, and plastered to the front of it was a green American flag ecology sticker. Beside him was a stainless steel cart of some kind. From the twin loudspeakers came the sound of John Denver singing \u0027Thank God I\u0027m a Country Boy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that cart?\u0027 Johnny asked.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll see,\u0027 Roger said, still grinning hugely.\\n\\n Herman said: \u0027The wild card is Gregory Ammas Stillson, forty-three, ex-salesman for the Truthway Bible Company of America, ex-housepainter, and, in Oklahoma, where he grew up, one-time rainmaker.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Rainmaker,\u0027 said Johnny, bemused.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s one of his planks,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027If he\u0027s elected, we\u0027ll have rain whenever we need it.\u0027\\n\\n George Herman went on: Stillson\u0027s platform is ... well, refreshing.\u0027\\n\\n John Denver finished singing with a yell that brought answering cheers from the crowd. Then Stillson started talking, his voice booming at peak amplification. His PA system at least was sophisticated; there was hardly any distortion. His voice made Johnny vaguely uneasy. The man had the high, hard, pumping delivery of a revival preacher. You could see a fine spray of spittle from his lips as he talked.\\n\\n \u0027What are we gonna do in Washington? Why do we want to go to Washington?\u0027 Stillson roared. \u0027What\u0027s our platform? Our platform got five boards, my friends n neighbors, five old boards! And what are they? I\u0027ll tell you up front! First board: THROW THE BUMS OUT!\u0027\\n\\n A tremendous roar of approval ripped out of the crowd. Someone threw double handfuls of confetti into the air and someone else yelled, \u0027Yaaaah-HOO!\u0027 Stillson leaned over his podium.\\n\\n \u0027You wanna know why I\u0027m wearing this helmet, friends n neighbors? I\u0027ll tell you why. I\u0027m wearin it because when you send me up to Washington, I\u0027m gonna go through them like you-know-what through a canebrake! Gonna go through em just like this!\u0027\\n\\n And before Johnny\u0027s wondering eyes, Stillson put his head down and began to charge up and down the podium stage like a bull, uttering a high, yipping Rebel yell as he did so. Roger Chatsworth simply dissolved in his chair, laughing helplessly. The crowd went wild. Stillson charged back to the podium, took off his construction helmet, and spun it into the crowd. A minor riot over possession of it immediately ensued.\\n\\n \u0027Second board!\u0027 Stillson yelled into the mike. \u0027We\u0027re gonna throw out anyone in the government, from the highest to the lowest, who is spending time in bed with some gal who ain\u0027t his wife! If they wanna sleep around, they ain\u0027t gonna do it on the public tit!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What did he say?\u0027 Johnny asked, blinking.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, he\u0027s just getting warmed up,\u0027 Roger said. He wiped his streaming eyes and went off into another gale of laughter. Johnny wished it seemed that funny to him.\\n\\n \u0027Third board!\u0027 Stillson roared. \u0027We\u0027re gonna send all the pollution right into outer space! Gonna put it in Hefty bags! Gonna put it in Glad bags! Gonna send it to Mars, to Jupiter, and the rings of Saturn! We\u0027re gonna have clean air and we\u0027re gonna have clean water and we\u0027re gonna have it in SIX MONTHS!\u0027\\n\\n The crowd was in paroxysms of joy. Johnny saw many people in the crowd who were almost killing themselves laughing, as Roger Chatsworth was presently doing.\\n\\n \u0027Fourth board! We\u0027re gonna have all the gas and oil we need! We\u0027re gonna stop playing games with these Arabs and get down to brass tacks! Ain\u0027t gonna be no old people in New Hampshire turned into Popsicles this coming winter like there was last winter!\u0027\\n\\n This brought a solid roar of approval. The winter before an old woman in Portsmouth had been found frozen to death in her third-floor apartment, apparently following a turn-off by the gas company for nonpayment.\\n\\n \u0027We got the muscle, friends n neighbors, we can do it! Anybody out there think we can\u0027t do it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027NO!\u0027 The crowd bellowed back.\\n\\n \u0027Last board,\u0027 Stillson said, and approached the metal cart. He threw back the hinged lid and a cloud of steam puffed out. \u0027HOT DOGS!!\u0027\\n\\n He began to grab double handfuls of hot dogs from the cart, which Johnny now recognized as a portable steam table. He threw them into the crowd and went back for more. Hot dogs flew everywhere. \u0027Hot dogs for every man, woman, and child in America! And when you put Greg Stillson in the House of Representatives, you gonna say HOT DOG! SOMEONE GIVES A RIP AT LAST!\u0027\\n\\n The picture changed. The podium was being dismantled by a crew of long-haired young men who looked like rock band roadies. Three more of them were cleaning up the litter the crowd had left behind. George Herman resumed: \u0027Democratic candidate David Bowes calls Still-son a practical joker who is trying to throw a monkey-wrench into the workings of the democratic process. Harrison Fisher is stronger in his criticism. He calls Stillson a cynical carnival pitchman who is playing the whole idea of the free election as a burlesque-house joke. In speeches, he refers to independent candidate Stilison as the only member of the American Hot Dog party. But the fact is this: the latest CBS poll in New Hampshire\u0027s third district showed David Bowes with twenty percent of the vote, Harrison Fisher with twenty-six - and maverick Greg Stillson with a whopping forty-two percent. Of course election day is still quite a way down the road, and things may change. But for now, Greg Stillson has captured the hearts - if not the minds - of New Hampshire\u0027s third-district voters.\u0027\\n\\n The TV showed a shot of Herman from the waist up. Both hands had been out of sight. Now he raised one of them. and in it was a hot dog. He took a big bite.\\n\\n \u0027This is George Herman, CBS News, in Ridgeway, New Hampshire.\u0027\\n\\n Walter Cronkite came back on in the CBS newsroom, chuckling. \u0027Hot dogs,\u0027 he said, and chuckled again. \u0027And that\u0027s the way it is - . -,\\n\\n Johnny got up and snapped off the set. \u0027I just can\u0027t believe that,\u0027 he said. \u0027That guy\u0027s really a candidate? It\u0027s not a joke?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whether it\u0027s a joke or not is a matter of personal interpretation,\u0027 Roger said, grinning, \u0027but he really is running. I\u0027m a Republican myself, born and bred, but I must admit I get a kick out of that guy Stillson. You know he hired half a dozen ex-motorcycle outlaws as bodyguards?\\n\\n Real iron horsemen. Not Hell\u0027s Angels or anything like that, but I guess they were pretty rough customers. He seems to have reformed them.\u0027\\n\\n Motorcycle freaks as security. Johnny didn\u0027t like the sound of that very much. The motorcycle freaks had been in charge of security when the Rolling Stones gave their free concert at Altamont Speedway in California. It hadn\u0027t worked out so well.\\n\\n \u0027People put up with a ... a motorcycle goon squad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, it really isn\u0027t like that. They\u0027re quite cleancut. And Stillson has a helluva reputation around Ridgeway for reforming kids in trouble.\\n\\n Johnny grunted doubtfully.\\n\\n \u0027You saw him,\u0027 Roger said, gesturing at the TV set. \u0027The man is a clown. He goes charging around the speaking platform, like that at every rally. Throws his helmet into the crowd - I\u0027d guess he\u0027s gone through a hundred of them by now - and gives out hot dogs. He\u0027s a clown, so what? Maybe people need a little comic relief from time to time. We\u0027re runningout of oil, the inflation is slowly but surely getting out of control, the average guy\u0027s tax load has never been heavier, and we\u0027re apparently getting ready to elect a fuzzy-minded Georgia cracker president of the United States. So people want a giggle or two. Even more, they want to thumb their noses at a political establishment that doesn\u0027t seem able to solve anything. Stillson\u0027s harmless.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s in orbit,\u0027 Johnny said, and they both laughed.\\n\\n \u0027We have plenty of crazy politicians around,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027In New Hampshire we\u0027ve got Stillson, who wants to hot dog his way into the House of Representatives, so what? Out in California they\u0027ve got Hayakawa. Or take our own governor, Meldrim Thomson. Last year he wanted to arm the New Hampshire National Guard with tactical nuclear weapons. I\u0027d call that big-time crazy.\\n\\n \u0027Are you saying it\u0027s okay for those people in the third district to elect the village fool to represent them in Washington?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t get it,\u0027 Chatsworth said patiently. \u0027Take a voter\u0027s-eye-view, Johnny. Those third-district people are mostly all blue-collars and shopkeepers. The most rural parts of the district are just starting to develop some recreational potential. Those people look at David Bowes and they see a hungry young kid who\u0027s trying to get elected on the basis of some slick talk and a passing resemblance to Dustin Hoffman. They\u0027re supposed to think he\u0027s a man of the people because he wears blue jeans.\\n\\n \u0027Then take Fisher. My man, at least nominally. I\u0027ve organized fund raisers for him and the other Republican candidates around this part of New Hampshire. He\u0027s been on the Hill so long he probably thinks the Capitol dome would split in two pieces if he wasn\u0027t around to give it moral support. He\u0027s never had an original thought in his life, he never went against the party line in his life. There\u0027s no stigma attached to his name because he\u0027s too stupid to be very crooked, although he\u0027ll probably wind up with some mud on him from this Koreagate thing. His speeches have all the excitement of the copy of the National Plumbers Wholesale Catalogue. People don\u0027t know all those things, but they can sense them sometimes. The idea that Harrison Fisher is doing anything for his constituency is just plain ridiculous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So the answer is to elect a loony?\u0027\\n\\n Chatsworth smiled indulgently. \u0027Sometimes these loonies turn out doing a pretty good job. Look at Bella Abzug. There\u0027s a damn fine set of brains under those crazy hats. But even if Stillson turns out to be as crazy in Washington as he is down in Ridgeway, he\u0027s only renting the seat for two years. They\u0027ll turn him out in \u002778 and put in someone who understands the lesson.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The lesson?\u0027\\n\\n Roger stood up. \u0027Don\u0027t fuck the people over for too long,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s the lesson. Adam Clayton Powell found out. Agnew and Nixon did, too. Just... don\u0027t fuck the people for too long.\u0027 He glanced at his watch. \u0027Come on over to the big house and have a drink, Johnny.\\n\\n Shelley and I are going out later on, but we\u0027ve got time for a short one.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny smiled and got up. \u0027Okay,\u0027 he said. \u0027You twisted my arm. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-20.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
