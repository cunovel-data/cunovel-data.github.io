But we\u0027ll be back up every weekend.\u0027\n \u0027I want to stay with my boy,\u0027 Vera said loudly.\n \u0027It\u0027s best that you don\u0027t, Mom,\u0027 Johnny said. The depression had lifted a little bit, but he remembered how black it had been. If his mother started to talk about God\u0027s wonderful plan for him while he was in that state, he doubted if he would be able to hold back his cackles of hysterical laughter.\n \u0027You need me, John. You need me to explain\n \u0027First I need to get well,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027You can explain after I can walk. Okay?\u0027\n She didn\u0027t answer. There was an almost comically stubborn expression on her face - except there was nothing very funny about it. Nothing at all. Nothing but a quirk of fate, that\u0027s all. Five minutes earlier or later on that road would have changed everything. Now look at us, all of us fucked over royally. And she believes it\u0027s God\u0027s plan. It\u0027s either that or go completely crazy, I suppose.\n To break the awkward silence, Johnny said: \u0027Well, did Nixon get reelected, dad? Who ran against him?\u0027\n \u0027He got reelected,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027He ran against Mc-Govern.\u0027\n \u0027Who?\u0027\n \u0027McGovern. George McGovern. Senator from South Dakota.\u0027\n \u0027Not Muskie?\u0027\n \u0027No. But Nixon\u0027s not president anymore. He resigned.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027He was a liar,\u0027 Vera said dourly. \u0027He became swollen with pride and the Lord brought him low.\u0027\n \u0027Nixon resigned?\u0027 Johnny was flabbergasted. \u0027Him?\u0027\n \u0027It was either quit or be fired,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027They were getting ready to impeach him.\u0027\n Johnny suddenly realized that there had been some great and fundamental upheaval in American politics -almost surely as a result of the war in Vietnam - and he had missed it. For the first time he really felt like Rip van Winkle. How much had things changed? He was almost afraid to ask. Then a really chilling thought occurred.\n \u0027Agnew... Agnew\u0027s president?\u0027\n \u0027Ford,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027A good, honest man.\u0027\n \u0027Henry Ford is president of the United States?\u0027\n \u0027Not Henry,\u0027 she said. \u0027Jerry.\u0027\n He stared from one to the other, more than half convinced that all this was a dream or a bizarre joke.\n \u0027Agnew resigned, too,\u0027 Vera said. Her lips were pressed thin and white. \u0027He was a thief. He accepted a bribe right in his office. That\u0027s what they say.\n \u0027He didn\u0027t resign over the bribe,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027He resigned over some mess back in Maryland. He was up to his neck in it, I guess. Nixon nominated Jerry Ford to become vice president. Then Nixon resigned last August and Ford took over. He nominated Nelson Rockefeller to be vice president. And that\u0027s where we are now.\n \u0027A divorced man,\u0027 Vera said grimly. \u0027God forbid he ever becomes the president.\u0027\n \u0027What did Nixon do?\u0027 Johnny asked. \u0027Jesus Christ, I...\u0027 He glanced at his mother, whose brow had clouded instantly. \u0027I mean, holy crow, if they were going to impeach him...\n \u0027You needn\u0027t take the Savior\u0027s name in vain over a bunch of crooked politicians,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027It was Watergate.\u0027\n \u0027Watergate? Was that an operation in Vietnam? Something like that?\u0027\n \u0027The Watergate Hotel in Washington,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Some Cubans broke into the offices of the Democratic Committee there and got caught. Nixon knew about it. He tried to cover it up.\u0027\n \u0027Are you kidding?\u0027 Johnny managed at last.\n \u0027It was the tapes,\u0027 Vera said. \u0027And that John Dean. Nothing but a rat deserting a sinking ship, that\u0027s what I think. A common tattletale.\u0027\n \u0027Daddy, can you explain this to me?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll try,\u0027 Herb said, \u0027but I don\u0027t think the whole story has come out, even yet. And I\u0027ll bring you the books. There\u0027s been about a million books written on it already, and I guess there\u0027ll be a million more before it\u0027s finally done. Just before the election, in the summer of 1972...\u0027\n 2.\n It was ten-thirty and his parents were gone. The lights on the ward had been dimmed. Johnny couldn\u0027t sleep. It was all dancing around in his head, a frightening jumble of new input. The world had changed more resoundingly than he would have believed possible in so short a time. He felt out of step and out of tune.\n Gas prices had gone up nearly a hundred percent, his father had told him. At the time of his accident, you could buy regular gas for thirty or thirty-two cents a gallon. Now it was fifty-four cents and sometimes there were lines at the pumps. The legal speed limit all over the country was fifty-five miles an hour and the long-haul truckers had almost revolted over that.\n But all of that was nothing. Vietnam was over. It had ended. The country had finally gone Communist. Herb said it had happened just as Johnny began to show signs that he might come out of his coma. After all those years and all that bloodshed, the heirs of Uncle Ho had rolled up the country like a windowshade in a matter of days.\n The president of the United States had been to Red China. Not Ford, but Nixon. He had gone before he resigned. Nixon, of all people, the old witch-hunter himself. If anyone but his dad had told him that, Johnny would have flatly refused to believe.\n It was all too much, it was too scary. Suddenly he didn\u0027t want to know any more, for fear it might drive him totally crazy. That pen Dr. Brown had had, that Flair -how many other things were there like that? How many hundreds of little things, all of them making the point over and over again: You lost part of your life, almost six percent, if the actuarial tables are to be believed. You\u0027re behind the times. You missed out.\n \u0027John?\u0027 The voice was soft. \u0027Are you asleep, John?\u0027\n He turned over. A dim silhouette stood in his doorway. A small man with rounded shoulders. It was Weizak.\n \u0027No. I\u0027m awake.\u0027\n \u0027I hoped so. May I come in?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. Please do.\u0027\n Weizak looked older tonight. He sat by Johnny\u0027s bed. \u0027I was on the phone earlier,\u0027 he said. \u0027I called directory assistance for Carmel, California. I asked for a Mrs. Johanna Borentz. Do you think there was such a number?\u0027\n \u0027Unless it\u0027s unlisted Qr she doesn\u0027t have a phone at all,\u0027 Johnny said.\n \u0027She has a phone. I was given the number.\u0027\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 Johnny said. He was interested because he liked Weizak, but that was all. He felt no need to have his knowledge of Johanna Borentz validated, because he knew it was valid knowledge - he knew it the same way he knew he was right-handed.\n \u0027I sat for a long time and thought about it,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027I told you my mother was dead, but that was really only an assumption. My father died in the defense of Warsaw. My mother simply never turned up, huh? It was logical to assume that she had been killed in the shelling... during the occupation ... you understand. She never turned up, so it was logical to assume that. Amnesia ... as a neurologist I can tell you that permanent, general amnesia is very, very rare. Probably rarer than true schizophrenia. I have never read of a documented case lasting thirtyfive years.\u0027\n \u0027She recovered from her amnesia long ago,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I think she simply blocked everything out. When her memory did come back, she had remarried and was the mother of two children... possibly three. Remembering became a guilt trip, maybe. But she dreams of you. \"The boy is safe.\" Did you call her?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027I dialed it direct. Did you know you could do that now? Yes. It is a great convenience. You dial one, the area code, the number. Eleven digits and you can be in touch with any place in the country.\n It is an amazing thing. In some ways a frightening thing.. A boy - no, a young man - answered the telephone. I asked if Mrs. Borentz was at home. I heard him call, \"Mom, it\u0027s for you.\" Clunk went the receiver on the table or desk or whatever. I stood in Bangor, Maine, not forty miles from the Atlantic Ocean and listened to a young man put the phone down on a table in a town on the Pacific Ocean. My heart ... it was pounding so hard it frightened me. The wait seemed long. Then she picked up the phone and said, \"Yes? Hello?\"\u0027\n \u0027What did you say? How did you handle it?\u0027\n \u0027I did not, as you say, handle it,\u0027 Weizak replied, and smiled crookedly. \u0027I hung up the telephone. And I wished for a strong drink, but I did not have one.\n \u0027Are you satisfied it was her?\u0027\n \u0027John, what a naive question! I was nine years old in 1939.I had not heard my mother\u0027s voice since then. She spoke only Polish when I knew her I speak only English now ... I have forgotten much of my native language, which is a shameful thing. How could I be satisfied one way or the other?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but were you?\u0027\n Weizak scrubbed a hand slowly across his forehead. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was her. It was my mother.\u0027\n \u0027But you couldn\u0027t talk to her?\u0027\n \u0027Why should I?\u0027 Weizak asked, sounding almost angry. \u0027Her life is her life, huh? It is as you said. The boy is safe. Should I upset a woman that is just coming into her years of peace? Should I take the chance of destroying her equilibrium forever? Those feelings of guilt you mentioned ... should I set them free? Or even run the risk of so doing?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Johnny said. They were troublesome questions, and the answers were beyond him - but he felt that Weizak was trying to say something about what he had done by articulating the questions. The questions he could not answer.\n \u0027The boy is safe, the woman is safe in Carmel. The country is between them, and we let that be. But what about you, John? What are we going to do about you?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand what you mean.\u0027\n \u0027I will spell it out for you then, huh? Dr. Brown is angry. He is angry at me, angry at you, and angry at himself, I suspect, for half-believing something he has been sure is total poppycock for his whole life. The nurse who was a witness will never keep her silence. She will tell her husband tonight in bed, and it may end there, but her husband may tell his boss, and it is very possible that the papers will have wind of this by tomorrow evening. \"Coma Patient Re-Awakens with Second Sight.\"\u0027\n \u0027Second sight,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Is that what it is?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what it is, not really. Is it psychic? Seer? Handy words that describe nothing, nothing at all. You told one of the nurses that her son\u0027s optic surgery was going to be successful...\n \u0027Marie,\u0027 Johnny murmured. He smiled a little. He liked Marie.\n ... and that is already all over the hospital. Did you see the future? Is that what second sight is? I don\u0027t know. You put a picture of my mother between your hands and were able to tell me where she lives today. Do you know where lost things and lost people may be found? Is that what second sight is? I don\u0027t know. Can you read thoughts? Influence objects of the physical world? Heal by the laying on of hands? These are all things that some call \"psychic\". They are all related to the idea of \"second sight\". They are things that Dr. Brown laughs at. Laughs? No. He doesn\u0027t laugh. He scoffs.\u0027\n \u0027And you don\u0027t?\u0027\n \u0027I think of Edgar Cayce. And Peter Hurkos. I tried to tell Dr. Brown about Hurkos and he scoffed. He doesn\u0027t want to talk about it; he doesn\u0027t want to know about it.\u0027\n Johnny said nothing.\n \u0027So... what are we going to do about you?\u0027\n \u0027Does something need to be done?\u0027\n \u0027I think so,\u0027 Weizak said. He stood up. \u0027I\u0027ll leave you to think it out for yourself. But when you think, think about this: some things are better not seen, and some things are better lost than found.\u0027\n He bade Johnny good night and left quietly. Johnny was very tired now, but still sleep did not come for a long time. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-9.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: \n Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
