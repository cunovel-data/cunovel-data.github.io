{"id":93660,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"1.\n Later, Johnny supposed that the reason he ended up finally making love to Sarah - almost five years to the day after the fair - had a lot to do with the visit of Richard Dees, the man from inside View. The reason he finally weakened and called Sarah and invited her to come and visit was little more than a wistful urge to have someone nice to come to call and take the nasty taste out of his mouth. Or so he told himself.\n He called her in Kennebunk and got the former roommate, who said Sarah would be right with him. The phone clunked down and there was a moment of silence when he contemplated (but not very seriously) just hanging up and closing the books for good. Then Sarah\u0027s voice was in his ear.\n \u0027Johnny? Is it you?\u0027\n \u0027The very same.\u0027\n \u0027How are you?\u0027\n \u0027Fine. How\u0027s by you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she said. \u0027Glad you called. I... didn\u0027t know if you would.\u0027\n \u0027Still sniffin that wicked cocaine?\u0027\n \u0027No, I\u0027m on heroin now.\u0027\n \u0027You got your boy with you?\u0027\n \u0027I sure do. Don\u0027t go anywhere without him.\u0027\n \u0027Well, why don\u0027t the two of you truck on out here some day before you have to go back up north?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027d like that, Johnny.\u0027 she said warmly.\n \u0027Dad\u0027s working in Westbrook and I\u0027m chief cook and bottlewasher. He gets home around four-thirty and we eat around five-thirty. You\u0027re welcome to stay for dinner, but be warned: all my best dishes use Franco-Amencan spaghetti as their base.\u0027\n She giggled. \u0027Invitation accepted. Which day is best?\u0027\n \u0027What about tomorrow or the day after, Sarah?\u0027\n \u0027Tomorrow\u0027s fine,\u0027 she said after the briefest of hesitations. \u0027See you then.\u0027\n \u0027Take care, Sarah.\u0027\n \u0027You too.\u0027\n He hung up thoughtfully, feeling both excited and guilty - for no good reason at all. But your mind went where it wanted to, didn\u0027t it? And where his mind wanted to go now was to examine possibilities maybe best left unconsidered.\n Well, she knows the thing she needs to know. She knows what time dad comes home - what else does she need to know?\n And his mind answered itself: What you going to do if she shows up at noon?\n Nothing, he answered, and didn\u0027t wholly believe it. Just thinking about Sarah, the set of her lips, the small, upward tilt of her green eyes - those were enough to make him feel weak and sappy and a little desperate.\n Johnny went out to the kitchen and slowly began to put together this night\u0027s supper, not so important, just for two. Father and son batching it. It hadn\u0027t been all that bad. He was still healing. He and his father had talked about the four-and-a-half years he had missed, about his mother - working around that carefully but always seeming to come a little closer to the center, in a tightening spiral. Not needing to understand, maybe, but needing to come to terms. No, it hadn\u0027t been that bad. It was a way to finish putting things together. For both of them. But it would be over in January when he returned to Cleaves Mills to teach. He had gotten his half-year contract from Dave Pelsen the week before, had signed it and sent it back. What would his father do then? Go on, Johnny supposed. People had a way of doing that, just going on, pushing through with no particular drama, no big drumrolls. He would get down to visit Herb as often as he could, every weekend, if that felt like the right thing to do. So many things had gotten strange so fast that all he could do was feel his way slowly along, groping like a blind man in an unfamiliar room.\n He put the roast in the oven, went into the living room, snapped on the TV, then snapped it off again. He sat down and thought about Sarah. The baby, he thought The baby will be our chaperon if she comes early. So that was all right, after all. All bases covered.\n But his thoughts were still long and uneasily speculative.\n 2.\n She came at quarter past twelve the next day, wheeling a snappy little red Pinto into the driveway and parking it, getting out, looking tall and beautiful, her dark blonde hair caught in the mild October wind.\n \u0027Hi, Johnny! \u0027 she called, raising her hand.\n \u0027Sarah!\u0027 He came down to meet her; she lifted her face and he kissed her cheek lightly.\n \u0027Just let me get the emperor,\u0027 she said, opening the passenger door.\n \u0027Can I help?\u0027\n \u0027Naw, we get along just fine together, don\u0027t we, Denny? Come on, kiddo.\u0027 Moving deftly, she unbuckled the straps holding a pudgy little baby in the car seat. She lifted him out. Denny stared around the yard with wild, solemn interest, and then his eyes fixed on Johnny and held there. He smiled.\n \u0027Vig!\u0027 Denny said, and waved both hands.\n \u0027I think he wants to go to you,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027Very unusual. Denny has his father\u0027s Republican sensibilities -he\u0027s rather standoffish. Want to hold him?\u0027\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 Johnny said, a little doubtfully.\n Sarah grinned. \u0027He won\u0027t break and you won\u0027t drop him,\u0027 she said, and handed Denny over. \u0027If you did, he\u0027d probably bounce right up like Silly Putty. Disgustingly fat baby.\n \u0027Vun bunk! \u0027 Denny said, curling one arm nonchalantly around Johnny\u0027s neck and looking comfortably at his mother.\n \u0027It really is amazing,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027He never takes to people like... Johnny? Johnny?\u0027\n When the baby put his arm around Johnny\u0027s neck, a confused rush of feelings had washed over him like mild warm water. There was nothing dark, nothing troubling. Everything was very simple. There was no concept of the future in the baby\u0027s thoughts. No feeling of trouble. No sense of past unhappiness. And on words, only strong images: warmth, dryness, the mother, the man that was himself.\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027 She was looking at him apprehensively.\n \u0027Hmmmm?\u0027\n \u0027Is everything all right?\u0027\n She\u0027s asking me about Denny, he realized. Is everything all right with Denny? Do you see trouble? Problems?\n \u0027Everything\u0027s fine,\u0027 he said. \u0027We can go inside if you want, but I usually roost on the porch. It\u0027ll be time to crouch around the stove all day long soon enough.\u0027\n \u0027I think the porch will be super. And Denny looks as if he\u0027d like to try out the yard. Great yard, he says. Right, kiddo?\u0027 She ruffled his hair and Denny laughed.\n \u0027He\u0027ll be okay?\u0027\n \u0027As long as he doesn\u0027t try to eat any of those wood-chips.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been splitting stove-lengths,\u0027 Johnny said, setting Denny down as carefully as a Ming vase. \u0027Good exercise.\u0027\n \u0027How are you? Physically?\u0027\n \u0027I think,\u0027 Johnny said, remembering the heave-ho he had given Richard Dees a few days ago, \u0027that I\u0027m doing as well as could be expected.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s good. You were kinda low the last time I saw you.\n Johnny nodded. \u0027The operations.\u0027\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027\n He glanced at her and again felt that odd mix of speculation, guilt, and something like anticipation in his viscera. Her eyes were on his face, frankly and openly. \u0027Yeah?\u0027\n \u0027Do you remember... about the wedding ring?\u0027 He nodded.\n \u0027It was there. Where you said it would be. I threw it away.\u0027\n \u0027Did you?\u0027 He was not completely surprised.\n \u0027I threw it away and never mentioned it to Walt.\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027And I don\u0027t know why. It\u0027s bothered me ever since.\n \u0027Don\u0027t let it.\u0027\n They were standing on the steps, facing each other. Color had come up in her cheeks, but she didn\u0027t drop her eyes.\n \u0027There\u0027s something I\u0027d like to finish,\u0027 she said simply. \u0027Something we never had the chance to finish.\u0027\n \u0027Sarah ...\u0027 he began, and stopped. He had absolutely no idea what to say next. Below them, Denny tottered six steps and then sat down hard. He crowed, not put out of countenance at all.\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s right or wrong. I love Walt. He\u0027s a good man, easy to love. Maybe the one thing I know is a good man from a bad one. Dan - that guy I went with in college - was one of the bad guys. You set my mouth for the other kind, Johnny. Without you, I never could have appreciated Walt for what he is.\u0027\n \u0027Sarah, you don\u0027t have .....\n \u0027I do have to,\u0027 Sarah contradicted. Her voice was low and intense. \u0027Because things like this you can only say once. And you either get it wrong or right, it\u0027s the end either way, because it\u0027s too hard to ever try to say again.\u0027 She looked at him pleadingly. \u0027Do you understand?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, I suppose I do.\u0027\n \u0027I love you, Johnny,\u0027 she said. \u0027I never stopped. I\u0027ve tried to tell myself that it was an act of God that split us up. I don\u0027t know. Is a bad hot dog an act of God? Or two kids dragging on a back road in the middle of the night? All I want ...\u0027 Her voice had taken on a peculiar flat emphasis that seemed to beat its way into the cool October afternoon like an artisan\u0027s small hammer into thin and precious foil, \u0027... all I want is what was taken from us.\u0027 Her voice faltered. She looked down. \u0027And I want it with all my heart, Johnny. Do you?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. He put his arms out and was confused when she shook her head and stepped away.\n \u0027Not in front of Denny,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s stupid, maybe, but that would be a little bit too much like public infidelity. I want everything, Johnny.\u0027 Her color rose again, and her pretty blush began to feed his own excitement. \u0027I want you to hold me and kiss me and love me,\u0027 she said. Her voice faltered, nearly broke. \u0027I think it\u0027s wrong, but I can\u0027t help it. It\u0027s wrong but it\u0027s right. It\u0027s fair.\u0027\n He reached out One finger and brushed away a tear that was moving slowly down her cheek.\n \u0027And it\u0027s only this once, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n She nodded. \u0027Once will have to put paid to everything. Everything that would have been, if things hadn\u0027t gone wrong.\u0027 She looked up, her eyes brighter green than ever, swimming with tears. \u0027Can we put paid to everything with only the one time, Johnny?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, smiling. \u0027But we can try, Sarah.\u0027\n She looked fondly down at Denny, who was trying to climb up onto the chopping block without much success. \u0027He\u0027ll sleep,\u0027 she said.\n 3.\n They sat on the porch and watched Denny play in the yard under the high blue sky. There was no hurry, no impatience between them, but there was a growing electricity that they both felt. She had opened her coat and sat on the porch glider in a powder-blue wool dress, her ankles crossed, her hair blown carelessly on her shoulders where the wind had spilled it. The blush never really left her face. And high white clouds fled across the sky, west to east.\n They talked of inconsequential things - there was no hurry. For the first time since he had come out of it, Johnny felt that time was not his enemy. Time had provided them with this little air pocket in exchange for the main flow of which they had been robbed, and it would be here for as long as they needed it. They talked about people who had been married, about a girl from Cleaves Mills who had won a Merit scholarship, about Maine\u0027s independent governor. Sarah said he looked like Lurch on the old Addams Family show and thought like Herbert Hoover, and they both laughed over that.\n \u0027Look at him,\u0027 Sarah said, nodding toward Denny.\n He was sitting on the grass by Vera Smith\u0027s ivy trellis, his thumb in his mouth, looking at them sleepily.\n She got his car-bed out of the Pinto\u0027s back seat.\n \u0027Will he be okay on the porch?\u0027 she asked Johnny. \u0027It\u0027s so mild, I\u0027d like to have him nap in the fresh air.\u0027\n \u0027He\u0027ll be fine on the porch,\u0027 Johnny said.\n She Set the bed in the shade, popped him into it, and pulled the two blankets up to his chin. \u0027Sleep, baby,\u0027 Sarah said.\n He smiled at her and promptly closed his eyes.\n \u0027Just like that?\u0027 Johnny asked.\n \u0027Just like that,\u0027 she agreed. She stepped close to him and put her arms around his neck. Quite clearly he could hear the faint rustle of her slip beneath her dress. \u0027I\u0027d like you to kiss me,\u0027 she said calmly. \u0027I\u0027ve waited five years for you to kiss me again, Johnny.\u0027\n He put his arms around her waist and kissed her gently. Her lips parted.\n \u0027Oh, Johnny,\u0027 she said against his neck. \u0027I love you.\u0027\n \u0027I love you too, Sarah.\u0027\n \u0027Where do we go?\u0027 she asked, stepping away from him. Her eyes were as dear and dark as emeralds now. \u0027Where?\u0027\n 4.\n He spread the faded army blanket, which was old but clean, on the straw of the second loft. The smell was fragrant and sweet. High above them there was the mysterious coo and flutter of the barn swallows, and then they settled down again. There was a small, dusty window which looked down on the house and porch. Sarah wiped a clean place on the glass and looked down at Denny.\n \u0027It\u0027s okay?\u0027 Johnny asked.\n \u0027Yes. Better here than in the house. That would have been like...\u0027 She shrugged.\n \u0027Making my dad a part of it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. This is between us.\u0027\n \u0027Our business.\u0027\n \u0027Our business,\u0027 she agreed. She lay on her stomach, her face turned to one side on the faded blanket, her legs bent at the knee. She pushed her shoes off, one by one. \u0027Unzip me, Johnny.\u0027\n He knelt beside her and pulled the zipper down. The sound was loud in the stillness. Her back was the color of coffee with cream against the whiteness of her slip. He kissed her between the shoulder blades and she shivered.\n \u0027Sarah,\u0027 he murmured.\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027I have to tell you something.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n \u0027The doctor made a mistake during one of those operations and gelded me.\u0027\n She punched him on the shoulder. \u0027Same old Johnny,\u0027 she said. \u0027And you had a friend once who broke his neck on the crack-the-whip at Topsham Fair.\u0027\n \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said.\n Her hand touched him like silk, moving gently up and down.\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t feel like they did anything terminal to you,\u0027 she said. Her luminous eyes searched his. \u0027Not at all. Shall we look and see?\u0027\n There was the sweet smell of the hay. Time spun out. There was the rough feel of the army blanket, the smooth feel of her flesh, the naked reality of her. Sinking into her was like sinking into an old dream that had never been quite forgotten.\n \u0027Oh, Johnny, my dear ...\u0027 Her voice in rising excitement. Her hips moving in a quickening tempo. Her voice was far away. The touch of her hair was like fire on his shoulder and chest. He plunged his face deeply into it, losing himself in that dark-blonde darkness.\n Time spinning out in the sweet smell of hay. The rough-textured blanket. The sound of the old barn creaking gently, like a ship, in the October wind. Mild white light coming in through the roof chinks, catching motes of chaff in half a hundred pencil-thin sunbeams. Motes of chaff dancing and revolving.\n She cried out. At some point she cried out his name, again and again and again, like a chant. Her fingers dug into him like spurs. Rider and ridden. Old wine decanted at last, a fine vintage.\n Later they sat by the window, looking out into the yard. Sarah slipped her dress on over bare flesh and left him for a little bit. He sat alone, not thinking, content to watch her reappear in the window, smaller, and cross the yard to the porch. She bent over the baby bed and readjusted the blankets. She came back, the wind blowing her hair out behind her and tugging playfully at the hem of her dress.\n \u0027He\u0027ll sleep another half hour,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Will he?\u0027 Johnny smiled. \u0027Maybe I will, too.\u0027\n She walked her bare toes across his belly. \u0027You better not.\u0027\n And so again, and this time she was on top, almost in an attitude of prayer, her head bent, her hair swinging forward and obscuring her face. Slowly. And then it was over.\n 5.\n \u0027Sarah...\u0027\n \u0027No, Johnny. Better not say it. Time\u0027s up.\u0027\n \u0027I was going to say that you\u0027re beautiful.\u0027\n \u0027Am I?\u0027\n \u0027You are,\u0027 he said softly. \u0027Dear Sarah.\u0027\n \u0027Did we put paid to everything?\u0027 she asked him.\n Johnny smiled. \u0027Sarah, we did the best we could.\u0027\n 6.\n Herb didn\u0027t seem surprised to see Sarah when he got home from Westbrook. He welcomed her, made much of the baby, and then scolded Sarah for not bringing him down sooner.\n \u0027He has your color and complexion,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027And I think he\u0027s going to have your eyes, when they get done changing.\u0027\n \u0027if only he has his father\u0027s brains,\u0027 Sarah said. She had put an apron on over the blue wool dress. Outside, the sun was going down. Another twenty minutes and it would be dark.\n \u0027You know, the cooking is supposed to be Johnny\u0027s job,\u0027 Herb said.\n \u0027Couldn\u0027t stop her. She put a gun to my head.\u0027\n \u0027Well, maybe it\u0027s all for the best,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Everything you make comes out tasting like Franco-American spaghetti.\u0027\n Johnny shied a magazine at him and Denny laughed, a high, piercing sound that seemed to fill the house.\n Can he see? Johnny wondered. It feels like it\u0027s written all over my face. And then a startling thought came to him as he watched his father digging in the entryway closet for a box of Johnny\u0027s old toys that he had never let Vera give away: Maybe he understands.\n They ate. Herb asked Sarah what Walt was doing in Washington and she told them about the conference he was attending, which had to do with Indian land claims. The Republican meetings were mostly wind-testing exercises, she said.\n \u0027Most of the people he\u0027s meeting with think that if Reagan is nominated over Ford next year, it\u0027s going to mean the death of the party.\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027And if the Grand Old Party dies, that means Walt won\u0027t be able to run for Bill Cohen\u0027s seat in 1978 when Cohen goes after Bill Hathaway\u0027s Senate seat.\n Herb was watching Denny eat string beans, seriously, one by one, using all six of his teeth on them. \u0027I don\u0027t think Cohen will be able to wait until \u002778 to get in the Senate. He\u0027ll run against Muskie next year.\u0027\n \u0027Walt says Bill Cohen\u0027s not that big a dope,\u0027 Sarah said. \u0027He\u0027ll wait. Walt says his own chance is coming, and I\u0027m starting to believe him.\u0027\n After supper they sat in the living room, and the talk turned away from politics. They watched Denny play with the old wooden cars and trucks that a much younger Herb Smith had made for his own son over a quarter of a century ago. A younger Herb Smith who had been married to a tough, good-humored woman who would sometimes drink a bottle of Black Label beer in the evening. A man with no gray in his hair and nothing but the highest hopes for his son.\n He does understand, Johnny thought, sipping his coffee. Whether he knows what went on between Sarah and me this afternoon, whether or not he suspects what might have gone on, he understands the basic cheat. You can\u0027t change it or rectify it, the best you can do is try to come to terms. This afternoon she and I consummated a marriage that never was. And tonight he\u0027s playing with his grandson.\n He thought of the Wheel of Fortune, slowing, stopping.\n House number. Everyone loses.\n Gloom was trying to creep up, a dismal sense of finality, and he pushed it away. This wasn\u0027t the time; he wouldn\u0027t let it be the time.\n By eight-thirty Denny had begun to get scratchy and cross and Sarah said, \u0027Time for us to go, folks. He can suck a bottle on our way back to Kennebunk. About three miles from here, he\u0027ll have corked off. Thanks for having us.\u0027 Her eyes, brilliant green, found Johnny\u0027s for a moment.\n \u0027Our pleasure entirely,\u0027 Herb said, standing up. \u0027Right, Johnny?\u0027\n \u0027Right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let me carry that car-bedout for you, Sarah.\u0027\n At the door. Herb kissed the top of Denny\u0027s head (and Denny grabbed Herb\u0027s nose in his chubby fist and honked it hard enough to make Herb\u0027s eyes water) and Sarah\u0027s cheek. Johnny carried the car-bed down to the red Pinto and Sarah gave him the keys so he could put everything in the back.\n When he finished, she was standing by the driver\u0027s door, looking at him. \u0027It was the best we could do,\u0027 she said, and smiled a little. But the brilliance of her eyes told him the tears were close again.\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t so bad at all,\u0027 Johnny said.\n \u0027We\u0027ll stay in touch?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, Sarah. Will we?\u0027\n \u0027No, I suppose not. It would be too easy, wouldn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Pretty easy, yes.\n She stepped close and stretched to kiss his cheek. He could smell her hair, clean and fragrant.\n \u0027Take care,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I\u0027ll think about you.\u0027\n \u0027Be good, Sarah,\u0027 he said, and touched her nose.\n She turned then, got in behind the wheel, a smart young matron whose husband was on the way up. I doubt like hell if they\u0027ll be driving a Pinto next year, Johnny thought.\n The lights came on, then the little sewing machine motor roared. She raised a hand to him and then she was pulling out of the driveway. Johnny stood by the chopping block, hands in his pockets, and watched her go. Something in his heart seemed to have closed. It was not a major feeling. That was the worst of it - it wasn\u0027t a major feeling at all.\n He watched until the taillights were out of sight and then he climbed the porch steps and went back into the house. His dad was sitting in the big easy chair in the living room. The TV was off. The few toys he had found in the closet were scattered on the rug and he was looking at them.\n \u0027Good to see Sarah,\u0027 Herb said. \u0027Did you and she have ...\u0027 there was the briefest, most minute hesitation\n - \u0027a nice visit?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Johnny said.\n \u0027She\u0027ll be down again?\u0027\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\n He and his father were looking at each other.\n \u0027Well now, maybe that\u0027s for the best,\u0027 Herb said finally.\n \u0027Yes. Maybe so.\u0027\n \u0027You played with these toys,\u0027 Herb said, getting down on his knees and beginning to gather them up. \u0027I gave a bunch of them to Lottie Gedreau when she had her twins, but I knew I had a few of them left. I saved a few back.\u0027\n He put them back in the box one at a time, turning each of them over in his hands, examining them. A race car. A bulldozer. A police car. A small hook-and-ladder truck from which most of the red paint had been worn away where a small hand would grip. He took them back to the entryway closet and put them away.\n Johnny didn\u0027t see Sarah Hazlett again for three years. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-16.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: \n Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
