{"id":93654,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"1. Johnny\u0027s first surgery was scheduled for May 28. Both Weizak and Brown had explained the procedure carefully to him. He would be given a local anesthetic - neither of them felt a general could be risked. This first operation would be on his knees and ankles. His own ligaments, which had shortened during his long sleep, would be lengthened with a combination of plastic wonder-fibers. The plastic to be used was also employed in heart valve bypass surgery. The question was not so much one of his body\u0027s acceptance or rejection of the artificial ligaments, Brown told him, as it was a question of his legs\u0027 ability to adjust to the change. if they had good results with the knees and the ankles, three more operations were on the boards: one on the long ligaments of his thighs, one on the elbow-trap ligaments, and possibly a third on his neck, which he could barely turn at all. The surgery was to be performed by Raymond Ruopp, who had pioneered the technique. He was flying in from San Francisco. \u0027What does this guy Ruopp want with me, if he\u0027s such a superstar?\u0027 Johnny asked. Superstar was a word he had learned from Marie. She had used it in connection with a balding, bespectacled singer with the unlikely name of Elton John. \u0027You\u0027re underestimating your own superstar qualities,\u0027 Brown answered. \u0027There are only a handful of people in the United States who have recovered from comas as long as yours was. And of that handful, your recovery from the accompanying brain damage has been the most radical and pleasing.\u0027 Sam Weizak was more blunt. \u0027You\u0027re a guinea pig, huh?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Look into the light, please.\u0027 Weizak shone a light into the pupil of Johnny\u0027s left eye. \u0027Did you know I can look right at your optic nerve with this thing? Yes. The eyes are more than the windows of the soul. They are one of the brain\u0027s most crucial maintenance points.\u0027 \u0027Guinea pig,\u0027 Johnny said morosely, staring into the savage point of light. \u0027Yes.\u0027 The light snapped off. \u0027Don\u0027t feel so sorry for yourself. Many of the techniques to be employed in your behalf - and some of those already employed - were perfected during the Vietnam war. No shortage of guinea pigs in the V.A. hospitals, nuh? A man like Ruopp is interested in you because you are unique. Here is a man who has slept four-and-a-half years. Can we make him walk again? An interesting problem. He sees the monograph he will write on it for The New England Journal of Medicine. He looks forward to it the way a child looks forward to new toys under the Christmas tree. He does not see you, he does not see Johnny Smith in his pain, Johnny Smith who must take the bedpan and ring for the nurse to scratch if his back itches. That\u0027s good. His hands will not shake. Smile, Johnny. This Ruopp looks like a bank clerk, but he is maybe the best surgeon in North America.\u0027 But it was hard for Johnny to smile. He had read his way dutifully through the tracts his mother had left him. They depressed him and left him frightened all over again for her sanity. One of them, by a man named Salem Kirban, struck him as nearly pagan in its loving contemplation of a bloody apocalypse and the yawning barbecue pits of hell. Another described the coming Antichrist in pulp-horror terms. The others were a dark carnival of craziness: Christ was living under the South Pole, God drove flying saucers, New York was Sodom, L.A. was Gomorrah. They dealt with exorcism, with witches, with all manner of things seen and unseen. It was impossible for him to reconcile the pamphlets with the religious yet earthy woman he had known before his coma. Three days after the incident involving Weizak\u0027s snap-shot of his mother, a slim and dark-haired reporter from the Bangor Daily News named David Bright showed up at the door of Johnny\u0027s room and asked if he could have a short interview. \u0027Have you asked the doctors?\u0027 Johnny asked. Bright grinned. \u0027Actually, no.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027In that case, I\u0027d be happy to talk to you.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re a man after my own heart,\u0027 Bright said. He came in and sat down. His first questions were about the accident and about Johnny\u0027s thoughts and feelings upon slipping out of the coma and discovering he had misplaced nearly half a decade. Johnny answered these questions honestly and straightforwardly. Then Bright told him that he had heard from \u0027a source\u0027 that Johnny had gained some sort of sixth sense as a result of the accident. \u0027Are you asking me if I\u0027m psychic?\u0027 Bright smiled and shrugged. \u0027That\u0027ll do for a start.\u0027 Johnny had thought carefully about the things Weizak had said. The more he thought, the more it seemed to him that Weizak had done exactly the right thing when he hung up the phone without saying anything. Johnny had begun to associate it in his mind with that W. W. Jacobs story, \u0027The Monkey\u0027s Paw\u0027. The paw was for wishing, but the price you paid for each of your three wishes was a black one. The old couple had wished for one hundred pounds and had lost their son in a mill accident - the mill\u0027s compensation had come to exactly one hundred pounds. Then the old woman had wished for her son back and he had come - but before she could open the door and see what a horror she had summoned out of its grave, the old man had used the last wish to send it back. As Weizak had said, maybe some things were better lost than found. \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m no more psychic than you are.\u0027 \u0027According to my source, you... \u0027No, it isn\u0027t true.\u0027 Bright smiled a trifle cynically, seemed to debate pressing the matter further, then turned to a fresh page in his notebook. He began to ask about Johnny\u0027s prospects for the future, his feelings about the road back, and Johnny also answered these questions as honestly as he could. \u0027So what are you going to do when you get out of here?\u0027 Bright asked, closing his notebook. \u0027I haven\u0027t really thought about that. I\u0027m still trying to adjust to the idea that Gerald Ford is the president.\u0027 Bright laughed. \u0027You\u0027re not alone in that, my friend.\u0027 \u0027I suppose I\u0027ll go back to teaching. It\u0027s all I know. But right now that\u0027s too far ahead to think about.\u0027 Bright thanked him for the interview and left. The artide appeared in the paper two days later, the day before his leg surgery. It was on the bottom of the front page, and the headline read: JOHN SMITH, MODERN RIP VAN WINKLE, FACES LONG ROAD BACK. There were three pictures, one of them Johnny\u0027s picture for the Cleaves Mills High School yearbook (it had been taken barely a week before the accident), a picture of Johnny in his hospital bed, looking thin and twisted with his arms and legs in their bent positions. Between these two was a picture of the almost totally demolished taxi, lying on its side like a dead dog. There was no mention in Bright\u0027s artide of sixth senses, precognitive powers, or wild talents. \u0027How did you turn him off the ESP angle?\u0027 Weizak asked him that evening. Johnny shrugged. \u0027He seemed like a nice guy. Maybe he didn\u0027t want to stick me with it.\u0027 \u0027Maybe not,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027But he won\u0027t forget it. Not if he\u0027s a good reporter, and I understand that he is.\u0027 \u0027You understand?\u0027 \u0027I asked around.\u0027 \u0027Looking out for my best interests?\u0027 \u0027We all do what we can, nuh? Are you nervous about tomorrow, Johnny?\u0027 \u0027Not nervous, no. Scared is a more accurate word.\u0027 \u0027Yes, of course you are. I would be.\u0027 \u0027Will you be there?\u0027 \u0027Yes, in the observation section of the operating theater. You won\u0027t be able to tell me from the others in my greens, but I will be there.\u0027 \u0027Wear something,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Wear something so I\u0027ll know it\u0027s you.\u0027 Weizak looked at him, and smiled. \u0027All right. I\u0027ll pin my watch to my tunic.\u0027 \u0027Good,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027What about Dr. Brown? Will he be there?\u0027 \u0027Dr. Brown is in Washington. Tomorrow he will present you to the American Society of Neurologists. I have read his paper. It is quite good. Perhaps overstated.\u0027 \u0027You weren\u0027t invited?\u0027 Weizak shrugged. \u0027I don\u0027t like to fly. That is something that scares me-\u0027 \u0027And maybe you wanted to stay here?\u0027 Weizak smiled crookedly, spread his hands, and said nothing. \u0027He doesn\u0027t like me much, does he?\u0027 Johnny asked. \u0027Dr. Brown?\u0027 \u0027No, not much,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027He thinks you are having us on. Making things up for some reason of your own. Seeking attention, perhaps. Don\u0027t judge him solely on that, John. His cast of mind makes it impossible for him to think otherwise. if you feel anything for Jim, feel a little pity. He is a brilliant man, and he will go far. Already he has offers, and someday soon he will fly from these cold north woods and Bangor will see him no more. He will go to Houston or Hawaii or possibly even to Paris. But he is curiously limited. He is a mechanic of the brain. He has cut it to pieces with his scalpel and found no soul. Therefore there is none. Like the Russian astronauts who circled the earth and did not see God. It is the empiricism of the mechanic, and a mechanic is only a child with superior motor control. You must never tell him I said that.\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027And now you must rest. Tomorrow you have a long day. 2. All Johnny saw of the worldfamous Dr. Ruopp during the operation was a pair of thick horn-rimmed glasses and a large wen at the extreme left side of the man\u0027s forehead. The rest of him was capped, gowned, and gloved. Johnny had been given two preop injections, one of demerol and one of atropine, and when he was wheeled in he was as high as a kite. The anesthetist approached with the biggest novocaine needle Johnny had ever seen in his life. He expected that the injection would hurt, and he was not wrong. He was injected between L4 and L5, the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, high enough up to avoid the cauda equina, that bundle of nerves at the base of the spine that vaguely resembles a horse\u0027s tail. Johnny lay on his stomach and bit his arm to keep from screaming. After an endless time, the pain began to fade to a dull sensation of pressure. Otherwise, the lower half of his body was totally gone. Ruopp\u0027s face loomed over him. The green bandit, Johnny thought. Jesse James in horn-rims. Your money or your life. \u0027Are you comfortable, Mr. Smith?\u0027 Ruopp asked. \u0027Yes. But I\u0027d just as soon not go through that again.\u0027 \u0027You may read magazines, if you like. Or you may watch in the mirror, if you feel it will not upset you.\u0027 \u0027All right.\u0027 \u0027Nurse, give me a blood pressure, please.\u0027 \u0027One-twenty over seventy-six, Doctor.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s lovely. Well, group, shall we begin?\u0027 \u0027Save me a drumstick,\u0027 Johnny said weakly, and was surprised by the hearty laughter. Ruopp patted his sheet-covered shoulder with one thinly gloved hand. He watched Ruopp select a scalpel and disappear behind the green drapes hung over the metal hoop that curved above Johnny. The mirror was convex, and Johnny had a fairly good if slightly distorted view of everything. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 Ruopp said. \u0027Oh yes, dee-de-dee ... here\u0027s what we want ... hum-de-hum... okay ... damp, please, Nurse, come on, wake up for Christ\u0027s sake ... yes sir ... now I believe I\u0027d like one of those... no, hold it... don\u0027t give me what I ask for, give me what I need ... yes, okay. Strap, please.\u0027 With forceps, the nurse handed Ruopp something that looked like a bundle of thin wires twisted together. Ruopp picked them delicately out of the air with tweezers. Like an Italian dinner, Johnny thought, and look at all that spaghetti sauce. That was what made him feel ill, and he looked away. Above him, in the gallery, the rest of the bandit gang looked down at him. Their eyes looked pale and merciless and frightening. Then he spotted Weizak, third from the right, his watch pinned neatly to the front of his gown. Johnny nodded. Weizak nodded back. That made it a little better. 3. Ruopp finished the connections between his knees and calves, and Johnny was turned over. Things continued. The anesthesiologist asked him if he felt all right. Johnny told her he thought he felt as well as possible under the circumstances. She asked him if he would like to listen to a tape and he said that would be very nice. A few moments later the dear, sweet voice of Joan Baez filled the operating room. Ruopp did his thing. Johnny grew sleepy and dozed off. When he woke up the operation was still going on. Weizak was still there. Johnny raised one hand, acknowledging his presence, and Weizak nodded again. 4. An hour later it was done. He was wheeled into a recovery room where a nurse kept asking him if he could tell her how many of his toes she was touching. After a while, Johnny could. Ruopp came in, his bandit\u0027s mask hanging off to one side. \u0027All right?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027It went very well,\u0027 Ruopp said. \u0027I\u0027m optimistic.\u0027 \u0027Good.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll have some pain,\u0027 Ruopp said. \u0027Quite a lot of it, perhaps. The therapy itself will give you a lot of pain at first. Stick with it.\u0027 \u0027Stick with it,\u0027 Johnny muttered. \u0027Good afternoon,\u0027 Ruopp said, and left. Probably, Johnny thought, to play a quick nine on the local golf course before it got too dark. 5. Quite a lot of pain. By nine P.M. the last of the local had worn off, and Johnny was in agony. He was forbidden to move his legs without the help of two nurses. It felt as if nail-studded belts had been looped around his knees and then cinched cruelly tight. Time slowed to an inchworm\u0027s crawl. He would glance at his watch, sure that an hour had passed since the last time he had looked at it, and would see instead that it had only been four minutes. He became sure he couldn\u0027t stand the pain for another minute, then the minute would pass, and he would be sure he couldn\u0027t stand it for another minute. He thought of all the minutes stacked up ahead, like coins in a slot five miles high, and the blackest depression he had ever known swept over him in a smooth solid wave and carried him down. They were going to torture him to death. Operations on his elbows, thighs, his neck. Therapy. Walkers, wheelchairs, canes. You\u0027re going to have pain ... stick with it. No, you stick with it, Johnny thought. Just leave me alone. Don\u0027t come near me again with your butchers\u0027 knives. If this is your idea of helping, I want no part of it. Steady throbbing pain, digging into the meat of him. Warmth on his belly, trickling. He had wet himself. Johnny Smith turned his face toward the wall and cried. 6. Ten days after that first operation and two weeks before the next one was scheduled, Johnny looked up from the book he was reading - Woodward and Bernstein\u0027s All the President\u0027s Men - and saw Sarah standing in the doorway, looking at him hesitantly. \u0027Sarah,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is you, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 She let out her breath shakily. \u0027Yes. It\u0027s me, Johnny.\u0027 He put the book down and looked at her. She was smartly dressed in a light-green linen dress, and she held a small, brown clutch bag in front of her like a shield. She had put a streak in her hair and it looked good. It also made him feel a sharp and twisting stab of jealousy -had it been her idea, or that of the man she lived and slept with? She was beautiful. \u0027Come in,\u0027 he said. \u0027Come in and sit down.\u0027 She crossed the room and suddenly he saw himself as she must see him - too thin, his body slumped a little to one side in the chair by the window, his legs stuck out straight on the hassock, dressed in a johnny and a cheap hospital bathrobe. \u0027As you can see, I put on my tux,\u0027 he said. \u0027You look fine.\u0027 She kissed his cheek and a hundred memories shuffled brightly through his mind like a doubled pack of cards. She sat in the other chair, crossed her legs, and tugged at the hem of her dress. They looked at each other without saying anything. He saw that she was very nervous. If someone were to touch her on the shoulder, she would probably spring right out of her seat. \u0027I didn\u0027t know if I should come,\u0027 she said, \u0027but I really wanted to.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad you did.\u0027 Like strangers on a bus, he thought dismally. It\u0027s got to be more than this, doesn\u0027t it? \u0027So how\u0027re you doing?\u0027 she asked. He smiled. \u0027I\u0027ve been in the war. Want to see my battle scars?\u0027 He raised his gown over his knees, showing the S-shaped incisions that were now beginning to heal. They were still red and hashmarked with stitches. \u0027Oh, my Lord, what are they doing to you?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together again,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027All the king\u0027s horses, all the king\u0027s men, and all the king\u0027s doctors. So I guess.. \u0027And then he stopped, because she was crying. \u0027Don\u0027t say it like that. Johnny,\u0027 she said. \u0027Please don\u0027t say it like that.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry. It was just ... I was trying to joke about it.\u0027 Was that it? Had he been trying to laugh it off or had it been a way of saying, Thanks for coming to see me, they\u0027re cutting me to pieces? \u0027Can you? Can you joke about it?\u0027 She had gotten a Kleenex from the clutch bag and was wiping her eyes with it. \u0027Not very often. I guess seeing you again ... the defenses go up, Sarah.\u0027 \u0027Are they going to let you out of here?\u0027 \u0027Eventually. It\u0027s like running the gauntlet in the old days, did you ever read about that? If I\u0027m still alive after every Indian in the tribe has had a swing at me with his tomahawk, I get to go free.\u0027 \u0027This summer?\u0027 \u0027No, I... I don\u0027t think so.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m so sorry it happened,\u0027 she said, so low he could barely hear her. \u0027I try to figure out why... or how things could have changed -,. and it just robs me of sleep. if I hadn\u0027t eaten that bad hot dog ... if you had stayed instead of going back...\u0027 She shook her head and looked at him, her eyes red. \u0027It seems sometimes there\u0027s no percentage. Johnny smiled. \u0027Double zero. House spin. Hey, you remember that? I clobbered that Wheel, Sarah.\u0027 \u0027Yes. You won over five hundred dollars. He looked at her, still smiling, but now the smile was puzzled, wounded almost. \u0027You want to know something funny? My doctors think maybe the reason I lived was because I had some sort of head injury when I was young. But I couldn\u0027t remember any, and neither could my mom and dad. But it seems like every time I think of it, I flash on that Wheel of Fortune ... and a smell like burning rubber.\u0027 \u0027Maybe you were in a car accident...\u0027 she began doubtfully. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s it. But it\u0027s like the Wheel was my warning... and I ignored it.\u0027 She shifted a little and said uneasily, \u0027Don\u0027t, Johnny.\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027Or maybe it was just that I used up four years of luck in one evening. But look at this, Sarah.\u0027 Carefully, painfully, he took one leg off the hassock, bent it to a ninety degree angle, then stretched it out on the hassock again. \u0027Maybe they can put Humpty back together again. When I woke up, I couldn\u0027t do that, and I couldn\u0027t get my legs to straighten out as much as they are now, either.\u0027 \u0027And you can think, Johnny,\u0027 she said. \u0027You can talk. We all thought that... you know.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, Johnny the turnip.\u0027 A silence fell between them again, awkward and heavy. Johnny broke it by saying with forced brightness, \u0027So how\u0027s by you?\u0027 \u0027Well... I\u0027m married. I guess you knew that.\u0027 \u0027Dad told me.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s such a fine man,\u0027 Sarah said. And then, in a burst, \u0027I couldn\u0027t wait, Johnny. I\u0027m sorry about that, too. The doctors said you\u0027d never come out of it, that you\u0027d get lower and lower until you just... just slipped away. And even if I had known ...\u0027 She looked up at him with an uneasy expression of defense on her face. \u0027Even if I had known, Johnny, I don\u0027t think I could have waited. Four-and-a-half years is a long time.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, it is,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s a hell of a long time. You want to hear something morbid? I got them to bring me four years worth of news magazines just so I could see who died. Truman. Janis Joplin. Jimi Hendrix - Jesus, I thought of him doing \"Purple Haze\" and I could hardly believe it. Dan Blocker. And you and me. We just slipped away.\u0027 \u0027I feel so bad about it,\u0027 she said, nearly whispering. \u0027So damn guilty. But I love the guy, Johnny. I love him a lot.\u0027 \u0027Okay, that\u0027s what matters.\u0027 \u0027His name is Walt Hazlett, and he\u0027s a...\u0027 \u0027I think I\u0027d rather hear about your kid,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027No offense, huh?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s a peach,\u0027 she said, smiling. \u0027He\u0027s seven months old now. His name is Dennis but we call him Denny. He\u0027s named after his paternal grandfather.\u0027 \u0027Bring him in sometime. I\u0027d like to see him.\u0027 \u0027I will,\u0027 Sarah said, and they smiled at each other falsely, knowing that nothing of the kind was ever going to happen. \u0027Johnny, is there anything that you need?\u0027 Only you, babe. And the last four-and-a-half years back again. \u0027Nah,\u0027 he said. \u0027You still teachin?\u0027 \u0027Still teachin, for a while yet,\u0027 she agreed. \u0027Still snortin that wicked cocaine?\u0027 \u0027Oh Johnny, you haven\u0027t changed. Same old tease.\u0027 \u0027Same old tease,\u0027 he agreed, and the silence fell between them again with an almost audible thump. \u0027Can I come see you again?\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027That would be fine, Sarah.\u0027 He hesitated, not wanting it to end so inconclusively, not wanting to hurt her or himself if it could be avoided. Wanting to say something honest. \u0027Sarah,\u0027 he said, \u0027you did the right thing.\u0027 \u0027Did I?\u0027 she asked. She smiled, and it trembled at the corners of her mouth. \u0027I wonder. It all seems so cruel and ... I can\u0027t help it, so wrong. I love my husband and my baby, and when Walt says that someday we\u0027re going to be living in the finest house in Bangor, I believe him. He says someday he\u0027s going to run for Bill Cohen\u0027s seat in the House, and I believe that, too. He says someday someone from Maine is going to be elected president, and I can almost believe that. And I come in here and look at your poor legs...\u0027 She was beginning to cry again now. \u0027They look like they went through a Mixmaster or something and you\u0027re so thin ... \u0027No, Sarah, don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re so thin and it seems wrong and cruel and I hate it, I hate it, because it isn\u0027t right at all, none of it!\u0027 \u0027Sometimes nothing is right, I guess,\u0027 he said. \u0027Tough old world. Sometimes you just have to do what you can and try to live with it. You go and be happy, Sarah. Ann if you want to come and see me, come on and come. Bring a cribbage board.\u0027 \u0027I will,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m sorry to cry. Not very cheery for you, huh?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 he said, and smiled. \u0027You want to get off that cocaine, baby. Your nose\u0027ll fall off.\u0027 She laughed a little. \u0027Same old Johnny,\u0027 she said. Suddenly she bent and kissed his mouth. \u00270h Johnny, be well soon.\u0027 He looked at her thoughtfully as she drew away. \u0027Johnny?\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t leave it,\u0027 he said. \u0027No, you didn\u0027t leave it at all.\u0027 \u0027Leave what?\u0027 She was frowning in puzzlement. \u0027Your wedding ring. You didn\u0027t leave it in Montreal.\u0027 He had put his hand up to his forehead and was rubbing the patch of skin over his right eye with his fingers. His arm cast a shadow and she saw with something very like superstitious fear that his face was half-light, half-dark. It made her think of the Halloween mask he had scared her with. She and Walt had honeymooned in Montreal, but how could Johnny know that? Unless maybe Herb had told him. Yes, that was almost certainly it. But only she and Walt knew that she had lost her wedding ring somewhere in the hotel room. No one else knew because he had bought her another ring before they flew home. She had been too embarrassed to tell anyone, even her mother. \u0027How... Johnny frowned deeply, then smiled at her. His hand fell away from his forehead and clasped its mate in his lap. \u0027It wasn\u0027t sized right,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were packing, don\u0027t you remember, Sarah? He was out buying something and you were packing. He was out buying... buying... don\u0027t know. It\u0027s in the dead zone.\u0027 Dead zone? \u0027He went out to a novelty shop and bought a whole bunch of silly stuff as souvenirs. Whoopee cushions and things like that. But Johnny, how could you know I lost my r... \u0027You were packing. The ring wasn\u0027t sized right, it was a lot too big. You were going to have it taken care of when you got back. But in the meantime, you.. ....... That puzzled frown began to return, then cleared immediately. He smiled at her. \u0027You stuffed it with toilet paper!\u0027 There was no question about the fear now. It was coiling lazily in her stomach like cold water. Her hand crept up to her throat and she stared at him, nearly hypnotized. He\u0027s got the same look in his eyes, that same cold amused look that he had when he was beating the Wheel that night. What\u0027s happened to you, Johnny? What are you? The blue of his eyes had darkened to a near violet, and he seemed far away. She wanted to run. The room itself seemed to be darkening, as if he were somehow tearing the fabric of reality, pulling apart the links between past and present. \u0027It slipped off your finger,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were putting his shaving stuff into one of those side pockets and it just sllipped off. You didn\u0027t notice you\u0027d lost it until later, and so you thought it was somewhere in the room.\u0027 He laughed, and it was a high, tinkling, tripping sound - not like Johnny\u0027s usual laugh at all - but cold ... cold. \u0027Boy, you two turned that room upside down. But you packed it. It\u0027s still in that suitcase pocket. All this time. You go up in the attic and look, Sarah. You\u0027ll see.\u0027 In the corridor outside, someone dropped a water glass or something and cursed in surprise when it broke. Johnny glanced toward the sound, and his eyes cleared. He looked back, saw her frozen, wide-eyed face, and frowned with concern. \u0027What? Sarah, did I say something wrong?\u0027 \u0027How did you know?\u0027 she whispered. \u0027How could you know those things?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 he said. \u0027Sarah, I\u0027m sorry\u0027 if I...\u0027 \u0027Johnny, I ought to go, Denny\u0027s with the sitter.\u0027 \u0027All right. Sarah, I\u0027m sorry I upset you.\u0027 \u0027How could you know about my ring, Johnny?\u0027 He could only shake his head. 7. Halfway down the first-floor corridor, her stomach began to feel strange. She found the ladies\u0027 just in time. She hurried in, dosed the door of one of the stalls, and threw up violently. She flushed and then stood with her eyes closed, shivering, but also close to laughter. The last time she had seen Johnny she had thrown up, too. Rough justice? Brackets in time, like bookends? She put her hands over her mouth to stifle whatever might be trying to get out - laughter or maybe a scream. And in the darkness the world seemed to tilt irrationally, like a dish. Like a spinning Wheel of Fortune. 8. She had left Denny with Mrs. Labelle, so when she got home the house was silent and empty. She went up the narrow stairway to the attic and turned the switch that controlled the two bare, dangling light bulbs. Their luggage was stacked up in one corner, the Montreal travel stickers still pasted to the sides of the orange Grants\u0027 suitcases. There were three of them. She opened the first, felt through the elasticized side pouches, and found nothing. Likewise the second. Likewise the third. She drew in a deep breath and then let it out, feeling foolish and a little disappointed - but mostly relieved. Overwhelmingly relieved. No ring. Sorry, Johnny. But on the other hand, I\u0027m not sorry at all. It would have been just a little bit too spooky. She started to slide the suitcases back into place between a tall pile of Walt\u0027s old college texts and the floor lamp that crazy woman\u0027s dog had knocked over and which Sarah had never had the heart to throw out. And as she dusted off her hands preparatory to putting the whole thing behind her, a small voice far inside her whispered, almost too low to hear, Sort of a flying search, wasn\u0027t it? Didn\u0027t really want to find anything, did you, Sarah? No. No, she really hadn\u0027t wanted to find anything. And if that little voice thought she was going to open all those suitcases again, it was crazy. She was fifteen minutes in picking up Denny. Walt was bringing home one of the senior partners in his firm for dinner (a very big deal), and she owed Bettye Hackman a letter - from the Peace Corps in Uganda, Bettye had gone directly into marriage with the son of a staggeringly rich Kentucky horse breeder. Also, she ought to dean both bathrooms, set her hair, and give Denny a bath. There was really too much to do to be frigging around up in this hot, dirty attic. So she pulled all three suitcases open again and this time she searched the side pockets very carefully, and tucked all the way down in the corner of the third suitcase she found her wedding ring. She held it up to the glare of one of the naked bulbs and read the engraving inside, still as fresh as it had been on the day Walt slipped the ring on her finger: WALTER AND SARAH HAZLETT - JULY 9, 1972. Sarah looked at it for a long time. Then she put the suitcases back, turned off the lights, and went back downstairs. She changed out of the linen dress, which was now streaked with dust, and into slacks and a light top. She went down the block to Mrs. Labelle\u0027s and picked up her son. They went home and Sarah put Denny in the living room, where he crawled around vigorously while she prepared the roast and peeled some potatoes. With the roast in the oven, she went into the living room and saw that Denny had gone to sleep on the rug. She picked him up and put him in his crib. Then she began to dean the toilets. And in spite of everything, in spite of the way the dock was racing toward dinnertime, her mind never left the ring. Johnny had known. She could even pinpoint the moment he had come by this knowledge. When she had kissed him before leaving. Just thinking about him made her feel weak and strange, and she wasn\u0027t sure why. It was all mixed up. His crooked smile, so much the same, his body, so terribly changed, so light and undernourished, the lifeless way his hair lay against his scalp contrasting so blindingly with the rich memories she still held of him. She had wanted to kiss him. \u0027Stop it,\u0027 she murmured to herself. Her face in the bathroom mirror looked like a stranger\u0027s face. Flushed and hot and let\u0027s face it, gang, sexy. Her hand dosed on the ring in the pocket of her slacks, and almost - but not quite - before she was aware of what she was going to do, she had thrown it into the clean, slightly blue water of the toilet bowl. All sparkly clean so that if Mr. Treaches of Baribault, Treaches, Moorehouse, and Gendron had to take a leak sometime during the dinner party, he wouldn\u0027t be offended by any unsightly ring around the bowl, who knows what road-blocks may stand in the way of a young man on his march toward the counsels of the mighty, right? Who knows anything in this world? It made a tiny splash and sank slowly to the bottom of the dear water, turning lazily over and over. She thought she heard a small clink when it struck the porcelain at the bottom, but that was probably just imagination. Her head throbbed. The attic had been hot and stale and musty. But Johnny\u0027s kiss - that had been sweet. So sweet. Before she could think about what she was doing (and thus allow reason to reassert itself), she reached out and flushed the toilet. It went with a bang and a roar. It seemed louder, maybe, because her eyes were squeezed shut. When she opened them, the ring was gone. It had been lost, and now it was lost again. Suddenly her legs felt weak and she sat down on the edge of the tub and put her hands over her face. Her hot, hot face. She wouldn\u0027t go back and see Johnny again. It wasn\u0027t a good idea. It had upset her. Walt was bringing home a senior partner and she had a bottle of Mondavi and a budget-fracturing roast, those were the things she would think about. She should be thinking about how much she loved Walt, and about Denny asleep in his crib. She should think about how, once you made your choices in this crazy world, you had to live with them. And she would not think about Johnny Smith and his crooked, charming smile anymore. 9. The dinner that night was a great success.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-10.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone.
