{"id":93652,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"1.\n \u0027Close your eyes,\u0027 Dr. Weizak said.\n He was a small, roly-poly man with an incredible styled head of hair and spade sideburns. Johnny couldn\u0027t get over all that hair. A man with a haircut like that in 1970 would have had to fight his way out of every bar in eastern Maine, and a man Weizak\u0027s age would have been considered ripe for committal.\n All that hair. Man.\n He closed his eyes. His head was covered with electrical contact points. The contacts went to wires that fed into a wall-console EEG. Dr. Brown and a nurse stood by the console, which was calmly extruding a wide sheet of graph paper. Johnny wished the nurse could have been Marie Michaud. He was a little scared.\n Dr. Weizak touched his eyelids and Johnny jerked.\n \u0027Nuh ... hold still, Johnny. These are the last two. Just... there.\u0027\n \u0027All right, Doctor\u0027,\u0027 the nurse said.\n A low hum.\n \u0027All right, Johnny. Are you comfortable?\u0027\n \u0027Feels like there are pennies on my eyelids.\u0027\n \u0027Yes? You\u0027ll get used to that in no time. Now let me explain to you this procedure. I am going to ask you to visualize a number of things. You will have about ten seconds on each, and there are twenty things to visualize in all. You understand?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\n \u0027Very fine. We begin. Dr. Brown?\u0027\n \u0027All ready.\u0027\n \u0027Excellent. Johnny, I ask you to see a table. On this table there is an orange.\u0027\n Johnny thought about it. He saw a small card-table with folding steel legs. Resting on it, a little off-center, was a large orange with the word SUNKIST stamped on its pocky skin.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 Weizak said.\n \u0027Can that gadget see my orange?\u0027\n \u0027Nuh ... well, yes; in a symbolic way it can. The machine is tracing your brainwaves. We are searching for blocks, Johnny. Areas of impairment. Possible indications of continuing intercranial pressure. Now I ask you to shush with the questions.\u0027\n \u0027All right.\u0027\n \u0027Now I ask you to see a television. It is on, but not receiving a station.\u0027\n Johnny saw the TV that was in his apartment - had been in his apartment. The screen was bright gray with snow. The tips of the rabbit ears were wrapped with tinfoil for better reception.\n \u0027Good.\u0027\n The series went on. For the eleventh item Weizak said, \u0027Now I ask you to see a picnic table on the left side of a green lawn.\u0027\n Johnny thought about it, and in his mind he saw a lawn chair. He frowned.\n \u0027Something wrong?\u0027 Weizak asked.\n \u0027No, not at all,\u0027 Johnny said. He thought harder. Picnics. Weiners, a charcoal brazier ... associate, dammit, associate. How hard can it be to see a picnic table in your mind, you\u0027ve only seen a thousand of them in your life; associate your way to it. Plastic spoons and forks, paper plates, his father in a chef\u0027s hat, holding a long fork in one hand and wearing an apron with a motto printed across it in tipsy letters, THE COOK NEEDS A DRINK. His father making burgers and then they would all go sit at the -Ah, here it came! Johnny smiled, and then the smile faded. This time the image in his mind was of a hammock. \u0027Shit!\u0027\n \u0027No picnic table?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s the weirdest thing. I can\u0027t quite ... seem to think of it. I mean, I know what it is, but I can\u0027t see it in my mind. Is that weird, or is that weird?\u0027\n \u0027Never mind. Try this one: a globe of the world, sitting on the hood of a pickup truck.\u0027\n That one was easy.\n On the nineteenth item, a rowboat lying at the foot of a street sign (who thinks these things up? Johnny wondered), it happened again. It was frustrating. He saw a beachball lying beside a gravestone. He concentrated harder and saw a turnpike overpass. Weizak soothed him, and a few moments later the wires were removed from his head and eyelids.\n \u0027Why couldn\u0027t I see those things?\u0027 he asked, his eyes moving from Weizak to Brown. \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027\n \u0027Hard to say with any real certainty,\u0027 Brown said. \u0027It may be a kind of spot amnesia. Or it may be that the accident destroyed a small portion of your brain - and I mean a really microscopic bit. We don\u0027t really know what the problem is, but it\u0027s pretty obvious that you\u0027ve lost a number of trace memories. We happened to strike two. You\u0027ll probably come across more.\u0027\n Weizak said abruptly, \u0027You sustained a head injury when you were a child, yes?\u0027\n Johnny looked at him doubtfully.\n \u0027There is an old scar,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027There is a theory, Johnny, backed by a good deal of statistical research...\u0027\n \u0027Research that is nowhere near complete,\u0027 Brown said, almost primly.\n \u0027That is true. But this theory supposes that the people who tend to recover from long-term coma are people who have sustained some sort of brain injury at a previous time... it is as though the brain has made some adaptation as the result of the first injury that allows it to survive the second.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s not proven,\u0027 Brown said. He seemed to disapprove of Weizak even bringing it up.\n \u0027The scar is there,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027Can you not remember what happened to you, Johnny? I would guess you must have blacked out. Did you fall down the stairs? A bicycle accident, perhaps? The Scar says this happened to a young boy.\u0027\n Johnny thought hard, then shook his head. \u0027Have you asked my mom and dad?\u0027\n \u0027Neither of them can remember any sort of head injury nothing occurs to you?\u0027\n For a moment, something did - a memory of smoke, black and greasy and smelling like rubber. Cold. Then it was gone. Johnny shook his head.\n Weizak sighed, then shrugged. \u0027You must be tired.\u0027\n \u0027Yes. A little bit.\u0027\n Brown sat on the edge of the examination table. \u0027It\u0027s quarter of eleven. You\u0027ve worked hard this morning. Dr. Weizak and I will answer a few questions, if you like, then you go up to your room for a nap. Okay?\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027The pictures you took of my brain ...\n \u0027The CAT-scan,\u0027 Weizak nodded. \u0027Computerized Axial Tomography.\u0027 He took a box of Chidets and shook three of them into his mouth. \u0027The CAT-scan is really a series of brain X-rays, Johnny. The computer highlights the pictures and...\u0027\n \u0027What did it tell you? How long have I got?\u0027\n \u0027What is this how long have I got stuff?\u0027 Brown asked. \u0027It sounds like a line from an old movie.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard that people who come out of long-term comas don\u0027t always last so long,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027They lapse back. It\u0027s like a light bulb going really bright before it burns out for good.\u0027\n Weizak laughed hard. It was a hearty, bellowing laugh, and it was something of a wonder that he didn\u0027t choke on his gum. \u0027Oh, such melodrama.\u0027 He put a hand on Johnny\u0027s chest. \u0027You think Jim and I are babies in this field? Nuh. We are neurologists. What you Americans call high-priced talent. Which means we are only stupid about the functions of the human brain instead of out-and-out ignoramuses. So I tell you, yes, there have been lapse-backs. But you will not lapse. I think we can say that, Jim, yes, okay?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Brown said. \u0027We haven\u0027t been able to find very much in the way of significant impairment. Johnny, there\u0027s a guy in Texas who was in a coma for nine years. Now he\u0027s a bank loan officer, and he\u0027s been doing that job for six years. Before that he was a teller for two years. There\u0027s a woman in Arizona who was down for twelve years. Something went wrong with the anesthesia while she was in labor. Now she\u0027s in a wheelchair, but she\u0027s alive and aware. She came out of it in 1969 and met the baby she had delivered twelve years before. The baby was in the seventh grade and an honors student.\u0027\n \u0027Am I going to be in a wheelchair?\u0027 Johnny asked. \u0027I can\u0027t straighten my legs out. My arms are a little better, but my legs...\u0027 He trailed off, shaking his head.\n \u0027The ligaments shorten,\u0027 Weizak said. \u0027Yes? That\u0027s why comatose patients begin to pull into what we call the prefetal position. But we know more about the physical degeneration that occurs in coma than we used to, we are better at holding it off. You have been exercised regularly by the hospital physical therapist, even in your sleep. And different patients react to coma in different ways. Your deterioration has been quite slow, Johnny. As you say, your arms are remarkably responsive and able. But there has been deterioration. Your therapy will be long and... should I lie to you? Nuh, I don\u0027t think so. It will be long and painful. You will shed your tears. You may come to hate your therapist. You may come to fall in love with your bed. And there will be operations - only one if you are very, very lucky, but perhaps as many as four - to lengthen those ligaments. These operations are still new. They may succeed completely, partially, or not at all. And yet as God wills it, I believe you will walk again. I don\u0027t believe you will ever ski or leap hurdles, but you may run and you will certainly swim.\u0027\n \u0027Thank you,\u0027 Johnny said. He felt a sudden wave of affection for this man with the accent and the strange haircut. He wanted to do something for Weizak in return - and with that feeling came the urge, almost the need, to touch him.\n He reached out suddenly and took Weizak\u0027s hand in both of his own. The doctor\u0027s hand was big, deeply lined, warm.\n \u0027Yes?\u0027 Weizak said kindly. \u0027And what is this?\u0027\n And suddenly things changed. It was impossible to say how. Except that suddenly Weizak seemed very clear to him. Weizak seemed to ... to stand forth, outlined in a lovely, clear light. Every mark and mole and line on Weizak\u0027s face stood in relief. And every line told its own story. He began to understand.\n \u0027I want your wallet,\u0027 Johnny said.\n \u0027My ... ?\u0027 Weizak and Brown exchanged a startled glance.\n \u0027There\u0027s a picture of your mother in your wallet and I need to have it,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027Please.\u0027\n \u0027How did you know that?\u0027\n \u0027Please!\u0027\n Weizak looked into Johnny\u0027s face for a moment, and then slowly dug under his smock and produced an old Lord Buxton, bulgy and out of shape.\n \u0027How did you know I carry a picture of my mother? She is dead, she died when the Nazis occupied Warsaw...\n Johnny snatched the wallet from Weizak\u0027s hand. Both he and Brown looked stunned. Johnny opened it, dismissed the plastic picture-pockets, and dug in the back instead, his fingers hurrying past old business cards, receipted bills, a canceled check, an old ticket to some political function. He came up with a small snapshot that had been laminated in plastic. The picture showed a young woman, her features plain, her hair drawn back under a kerchief. Her smile was radiant and youthful. She held the hand of a young boy. Beside her was a man in the uniform of the Polish army.\n Johnny pressed the picture between his hands and closed his eyes and for a moment there was darkness and then rushing out of the darkness came a wagon ... no, not a wagon, a hearse. A horse-drawn hearse. The lamps had been muffled in black sacking. Of course it was a hearse because they were\n (dying by the hundreds, yes, by the thousands, no match for the panzers, the wehrmacht, nineteenth-century cavalry against the tanks and machine guns. explosions. screaming, dying men. a horse with its guts blown out and its eyes rolling wildly, showing the white, an overturned cannon behind it and still they come. weizak comes, standing in his stirrups, his sword held high in the slanting rain of late summer 1939, his men following him, stumbling through the mud. the turret gun of the nazi tiger tank tracks him, braces him, brackets him, fires, and suddenly he is gone below the waist, the sword flying out of his hand; and down the road is warsaw. the nazi wolf is loose in europe)\n \u0027Really, we have to put a stop to this,\u0027 Brown said, his voice faraway and worried. \u0027You\u0027re overexciting yourself, Johnny.\u0027\n The voices came from far away, from a hallway in time.\n \u0027He\u0027s put himself in some kind of trance,\u0027 Weizak said. Hot in here. He was sweating. He was sweating because\n (the city\u0027s on fire, thousands are fleeing, a truck is roaring from side to side down a cobbled street, and the back of the truck is full of waving German soldiers in coal-scuttle helmets and the young woman is not smiling now, she is fleeing, no reason not to flee. the child has been sent away to safety and now the truck jumps the curb, the mudguard strikes her, shattering her hip and sending her flying through a plate glass window and into a clock shop and everything begins to chime. chime because of the time. the chime time is)\n \u0027Six o\u0027clock,\u0027 Johnny said thickly. His eyes had rolled up to straining, bulging whites. \u0027September 2, 1939, and all the cuckoo birds are singing.\u0027\n \u0027Oh my God, what is it we have?\u0027 Weizak whispered. The nurse had backed up against the EEG console, her face pale and scared. Everyone is scared now because death is in the air. It\u0027s always in the air in this place, this\n (hospital. smell of ether. they\u0027re screaming in the place of death. poland is dead, poland has fallen before the lightning warfare wehrmacht blitzkreig. shattered hip. the man in the next bed calling for water, calling, calling, calling. she remembers \u0027THE BOY IS SAFE.\u0027 what boy? she doesn\u0027t know. what boy? what is her name.- she doesn\u0027t remember. only that)\n \u0027The boy is safe,\u0027 Johnny said thickly. \u0027Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\u0027\n \u0027We have to put a stop to this,\u0027 Brown repeated.\n \u0027How do you suggest we do that?\u0027 Weizak asked, his voice brittle. \u0027It has gone too far to...\n Voices fading. The voices are under the clouds. Everything is under the clouds. Europe is under the clouds of war. Everything is under the clouds but the peaks, the mountain peaks of\n (switzerland. switzerland and now her name is BORENTZ. her name is JOHANNA BORENTZ and her husband is an engineer or an architect, whichever it is that builds the bridges. he builds in switzerland and there is goat\u0027s milk, goat\u0027s cheese. a baby. ooooh the labor! the labor is terrible and she needs drugs, morphine, this JOHANNA BORENTZ, because of the hip. the broken hip. it has mended, it has gone to sleep, but now it awakes and begins to scream as her pelvis spreads to let the baby out, one baby. two. and three. and four. they don\u0027t come all at once, no - they are a harvest of years, they are)\n \u0027The babies,\u0027 Johnny lilted, and now he spoke in a woman\u0027s voice, not his own voice at all. It was the voice of a woman. Then gibberish in song came from his mouth.\n \u0027What in the name of God...\u0027 Brown began.\n \u0027Polish, it is Polish!\u0027 Weizak cried. His eyes were bulging, his face pale. \u0027It is a cradle song and it is in Polish, my God, my Christ, what is it we have here?\u0027\n Weizak leaned forward as if to cross the years with Johnny, as if to leap them, as if to\n (bridge, a bridge, it\u0027s in turkey. then a bridge somewhere hot in the far east, is it Laos? can\u0027t tell, lost a man there, we lost HANS there, then a bridge in virginia, a bridge over the RAPPAHANNOCK RIVER and another bridge in california. we are applying for citizenship now and we go to classes in a hot little room in the back of a post-office where it always smells of glue. it is 1963, november, and when we hear kennedy has been killed in dallas we weep and when the little boy salutes his dead father\u0027s coffin she thinks \u0027THE BOY IS SAFE\u0027 and it brings back memories of some burning, some great burning and sorrow, what boy? she dreams about the boy, it makes her head hurt. and the man dies, HELMUT BORENTZ dies and she and the children live in carmel california. in a house on. on. on. can\u0027t see the street sign, it\u0027s in the dead zone, like the rowboat, like the picnic table on the lawn. it\u0027s in the dead zone. like warsaw. the children go away, she goes to their graduation ceremonies one by one, and her hip hurts. one dies in vietnam. the rest of them are fine. one of them is building bridges. her name is JOHANNA BORENTZ and late at night alone now she sometimes thinks in the ticking darkness: \u0027THE BOY IS SAFE.\u0027)\n Johnny looked up at them. His head felt strange. That peculiar light around Weizak had gone. He felt like himself again, but weak and a little pukey. He looked at the picture in his hands for a moment and then handed it back.\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027 Brown said. \u0027Are you all right?\u0027\n \u0027Tired,\u0027 he muttered.\n \u0027Can you tell us what happened to you?\u0027\n He looked at Weizak. \u0027Your mother is alive,\u0027 he said.\n \u0027No, Johnny. She died many years ago. In the war.\u0027\n \u0027A German trooptruck knocked her through a plate-glass show window and into a dock shop,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027She woke up in a hospital with amnesia. She had no identification, no papers. She took the name Johanna somebody. I didn\u0027t get that, but when the war was over she went to Switzerland and married a Swiss... engineer, I think. His specialty was building bridges, and his name was Helmut Borentz. So her married name was - is -Johanna Borentz.\u0027\n The nurse\u0027s eyes were getting bigger and bigger. Dr. Brown\u0027s face was tight, either because he had decided Johnny was having them all on or perhaps just because he didn\u0027t like to see his neat schedule of \u0027tests disrupted.\n But Weizak\u0027s face was still and thoughtful.\n \u0027She and Helmut Borentz had four children,\u0027 Johnny said in that same, calm, washed-out voice. \u0027His job took him all over the world. He was in Turkey for a while. Somewhere in the Far East, Laos, I think, maybe Cambodia. Then he came here. Virginia first, then some other places I didn\u0027t get, finally California. He and Johanna became U.S. citizens. Helmut Borentz is dead. One of the children they had is also dead. The others are alive and fine. But she dreams about you sometimes. And in the dreams she thinks, \u0027the boy is safe\u0027. But she doesn\u0027t remember your name. Maybe she thinks it\u0027s too late.\u0027\n \u0027California?\u0027 Weizak said thoughtfully. \u0027Sam,\u0027 Dr. Brown said. \u0027Really, you mustn\u0027t encourage this.\u0027\n \u0027Where in California, John?\u0027\n \u0027Carmel. By the sea. But I couldn\u0027t tell which street. It was there, but I couldn\u0027t tell. It was in the dead zone. Like the picnic table and the rowboat. But she\u0027s in Car-mel, California. Johanna Borentz. She\u0027s not old.\u0027\n \u0027No, of course she would not be old,\u0027 Sam Weizak said in that same thoughtful, distant tone. \u0027She was only twenty-four when the Germans invaded Poland.\u0027\n \u0027Dr. Weizak, I have to insist,\u0027 Brown said harshly. Weizak seemed to come out of a deep study. He looked around as if noticing his younger colleague for the first time. \u0027Of course,\u0027 he said. \u0027Of course you must. And John has had his question-and-answer period ... although I believe he has told us more than we have told him.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s nonsense,\u0027 Brown said curtly, and Johnny thought: He\u0027s scared. Scared spitless.\n Weizak smiled at Brown, and then at the nurse. She was eyeing Johnny as if he were a tiger in a poorly built cage. \u0027Don\u0027t talk about this, Nurse. Not to your supervisor, your mother, your brother, your lover, or your priest. Understood?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Doctor,\u0027 the nurse said. But she\u0027ll talk, Johnny thought, and then glanced at Weizak. And he knows it.\n He slept most of the afternoon. Around four P.M. he was rolled down the corridor to the elevator, taken down to neurology, and there were more tests. Johnny cried. He seemed to have very little control over the functions adults are supposed to be able to control. On his way back up, he urinated on himself and had to be changed like a baby. The first (but far from the last) wave of deep depression washed over him, carried him limply away, and he wished himself dead. Self-pity accompanied the depression and he thought how unfair this was. He had done a Rip van Winkle. He couldn\u0027t walk. His girl had married another man and his mother was in the grip of a religious mania, He couldn\u0027t see anything ahead that looked worth living for.\n Back in his room, the nurse asked him if he would like anything. If Marie had been on duty, Johnny would have asked for ice water. But she had gone off at three.\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said, and rolled over to face the wall. After a little while, he slept. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-8.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: \n Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
