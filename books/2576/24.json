{"id":93668,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"1.\\n\\n On June the 23rd, 1977, Chuck graduated from high school. Johnny, dressed in his best suit, sat in the hot auditorium with Roger and Shelley Chatsworth and watched as he graduated forty-third in his class. Shelley cried.\\n\\n Afterward, there was a lawn party at the Chatsworth home. The day was hot and humid. Thunderheads with purple bellies had formed in the west; they dragged slowly back and forth across the horizon, but seemed to come no closer. Chuck, flushed with three screwdrivers, came over with his girl friend, Patty Strachan, to show Johnny his graduation present from his parents - a new Pulsar watch.\\n\\n \u0027I told them I wanted that R2D2 robot, but this was the best they could do,\u0027 Chuck said, and Johnny laughed.\\n\\n They talked a while longer and then Chuck said with almost rough abruptness: \u0027I want to thank you, Johnny. If it hadn\u0027t been for you, I wouldn\u0027t be graduating today at all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, that isn\u0027t true,\u0027 Johnny said. He was a little alarmed to see that Chuck was on the verge of tears. \u0027Class always tells, man.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I keep telling him,\u0027 Chuck\u0027s girl said. Behind her glasses, a cool and elegant beauty was waiting to come out.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 Chuck said. \u0027Maybe it does. But I think I know which side my diploma is buttered on. Thanks a hell of a lot.\u0027 He put his arms around Johnny and gave him a hug.\\n\\n It came suddenly - a hard, bright bolt of image that made Johnny straighten up and dap his hand against the side of his head as if Chuck had struck him instead of hugging him. The image sank into his mind like a picture done by electroplate.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said. \u0027No way. You two stay right away from there.\u0027\\n\\n Chuck drew back uneasily. He had felt something. Something cold and dark and incomprehensible. Suddenly he didn\u0027t want to touch Johnny; at that moment he never wanted to touch Johnny again. It was as if he had found out what it would be like to lie in his own coffin and watch the lid nailed down.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny,\u0027 he said, and then faltered. \u0027What\u0027s what\u0027s\\n\\n Roger had been on his way over with drinks, and now he paused, puzzled. Johnny was looking over Chuck\u0027s shoulder, at the distant thunderheads. His eyes were vague and hazy.\\n\\n He said: \u0027You want to stay away from that place. There are no lightning rods.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Johnny ...\u0027 Chuck looked at his father, frightened. \u0027It\u0027s like he\u0027s having some kind of ... fit, or something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lightning,\u0027 Johnny proclaimed in a carrying voice. People turned their heads to look at him. He spread his hands. \u0027Flash fire. The insulation in the walls. The doors ... jammed. Burning people smell like hot pork.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s he talking about?\u0027 Chuck\u0027s girl cried, and conversation trickled to a halt. Now everyone was looking at Johnny, as they balanced plates of food and glasses.\\n\\n Roger stepped over. \u0027John! Johnny I What\u0027s wrong? Wake up!\u0027 He snapped his fingers in front of Johnny\u0027s vague eyes. Thunder muttered in the west, the voice of giants over gin rummy. perhaps. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s voice was clear and moderately loud, carrying to each of the fifty-some people who were there - businessmen and their wives, professors and their wives, Durham\u0027s upper middle class. \u0027Keep your son home tonight or he\u0027s going to burn to death with the rest of them. There is going to be a fire, a terrible fire. Keep him away from Cathy\u0027s. It\u0027s going to be struck by lightning and it will burn flat before the first fire engine can arrive. The insulation will burn. They will find charred bodies six and seven deep in the exits and there will be no way to identify them except by their dental work. It... it...,\\n\\n Patty Strachan screamed then, her hand going to her mouth, her plastic glass tumbling to the lawn, the ice cubes spilling out onto the grass and gleaming there like diamonds of improbable size. She stood swaying for a moment and then she fainted. going down in a pastel billow of party dress, and her mother ran forward, crying at Johnny as she passed: \u0027What\u0027s wrong with you? What in God\u0027s name is wrong with you?\u0027\\n\\n Chuck stared at Johnny. His face was paper-white.\\n\\n Johnny\u0027s eyes began to clear. He looked around at the staring knots of people. \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he muttered.\\n\\n Patty\u0027s mother was on her knees, holding her daughter\u0027s head in her arms and patting her cheeks lightly. The girl began to stir and moan.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny?\u0027 Chuck whispered, and then, without waiting for an answer, went to his girl.\\n\\n It was very still on the Chatsworth back lawn. Everyone was looking at him. They were looking at him because it had happened again. They were looking at him the way the nurses had. And the reporters. They were crows strung out on a telephone line. They were holding their drinks and their plates of potato salad and looking at him as if he were a bug, a freak. They were looking at him as if he had suddenly opened his pants and exposed himself to them.\\n\\n He wanted to run, he wanted to hide. He wanted to puke.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny,\u0027 Roger said, putting an arm around him. \u0027Come on in the house. You need to get off your feet for...\\n\\n Thunder rumbled, far off.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s Cathy\u0027s?\u0027 Johnny said harshly, resisting the pressure of Roger\u0027s arm over his shoulders. \u0027It isn\u0027t someone\u0027s house, because there were exit signs. What is it? Where is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can\u0027t you get him out of here?\u0027 Patty\u0027s mother nearly screamed. \u0027He\u0027s upsetting her all over again!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Johnny.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on.\u0027\\n\\n He allowed himself to be led away toward the guest house. The sound of their shoes on the gravel drive was very loud. There seemed to be no other sound. They got as far as the pool, and then the whispering began behind them.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s Cathy\u0027s?\u0027 Johnny asked again.\\n\\n \u0027How come you don\u0027t know?\u0027 Roger asked. \u0027You seemed to know everything else. You scared poor Patty Strachan into a faint.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t see it. It\u0027s in the dead zone. What is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get you upstairs first.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sick!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Under strain, then,\u0027 Roger said. He spoke softly and soothingly, the way people speak to the hopelessly mad. The sound of his voice made Johnny afraid. And the headache started to come. He willed it back savagely. They went up the stairs to the guest house.\\n\\n 2.\\n\\n \u0027Feel any better?\u0027 Roger asked.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s Cathy\u0027s?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a very fancy steakhouse and lounge in Somersworth. Graduation parties at Cathy\u0027s are something of a tradition. God knows why. Sure you don\u0027t want these aspirin?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Don\u0027t let him go, Roger. It\u0027s going to be hit by lightning. It\u0027s going to burn flat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Johnny,\u0027 Roger Chatsworth said, slowly and very kindly, \u0027you can\u0027t know a thing like that.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny drank ice water a small sip at a time and set the glass back down with a hand that shook slightly. \u0027You said you checked into my background. I thought...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I did. But you\u0027re drawing a mistaken conclusion. I knew you were supposed to be a psychic or something, but I didn\u0027t want a psychic. I wanted a tutor. You\u0027ve done a fine job as a tutor. My personal belief is that there isn\u0027t any difference between good psychics and bad ones, because I don\u0027t believe in any of that business. It\u0027s as simple as that. I don\u0027t believe it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That makes me a liar, then.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 Roger said in that same kind, low voice. \u0027I have a foreman at the mill in Sussex who won\u0027t light three on a match, but that doesn\u0027t make him a bad foreman. I have friends who are devoutly religious, and although I don\u0027t go to church myself, they\u0027re still my friends. Your belief that you can see into the future or sight things at a distance never entered into my judgment of whether or not to hire ......... that isn\u0027t quite true. It never entered into it once I\u0027d decided that it wouldn\u0027t interfere with your ability to do a good job with Chuck. It hasn\u0027t. But I no more believe that Cathy\u0027s is going to burn down tonight than I believe the moon is green cheese.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not a liar, just crazy,\u0027 Johnny said. In a dull sort of way, it was interesting. Roger Dussault and many of the people who wrote Johnny letters had accused him of trickery, but Chatsworth was the first to accuse him of having a Jeanne d\u0027Arc complex.\\n\\n \u0027Not that, either,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027You\u0027re a young man who was involved in a terrible accident and who has fought his way back against terrible odds at what has probably been a terrible price. That isn\u0027t a thing I\u0027d ever flap my jaw about freely, Johnny, but if any of those people out there on the lawn - including Patty\u0027s mother - want to jump to a lot of stupid conclusions they\u0027ll be invited to shut their mouths about things they don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cathy\u0027s,\u0027 Johnny said suddenly. \u0027How did I know the name, then? And how did I know it wasn\u0027t someone\u0027s house?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027From Chuck. He\u0027s talked about the party a lot this week.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not to me.\u0027\\n\\n Roger shrugged. \u0027Maybe he said something to Shelley or me while you were in earshot. Your subconscious happened to pick it up and file it away...\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 Johnny said bitterly. \u0027Anything we don\u0027t understand, anything that doesn\u0027t fit into our scheme of the way things are, we\u0027ll just file it under S for subconscious, right? The twentieth-century god. How many times have you done that when something ran counter to your pragmatic view of the world, Roger?\u0027\\n\\n Roger\u0027s eyes might have flickered a little - or it might have been imagination.\\n\\n \u0027You associated lightning with the thunderstorm that\u0027s coming,\u0027 he said. \u0027Don\u0027t you see that? It\u0027s perfectly sim . -.\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027m telling you this as simply as I can. That place is going to be struck by lightning. It\u0027s going to burn down. Keep Chuck home.\u0027\\n\\n Ah, God, the headache was coming for him. Coming like a tiger. He put his hand to his forehead and rubbed it unsteadily.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny, you\u0027ve been pushing much too hard.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Keep him home,\u0027 Johnny repeated.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s his decision, and I wouldn\u0027t presume to make it for him. He\u0027s free, white, and eighteen.\u0027\\n\\n There was a tap at the door. \u0027Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come in,\u0027 Johnny said, and Chuck himself came in. He looked worried.\\n\\n \u0027How are you?\u0027 Chuck asked.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I\u0027ve got a headache, that\u0027s all. Chuck ... please stay away from that place tonight. I\u0027m asking you as a friend. Whether you think like your dad or not. Please.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No problem, man,\u0027 Chuck said cheerfully, and whumped down on the sofa. He hooked a hassock over with one foot. \u0027Couldn\u0027t drag Patty within a mile of that place with a twenty-foot towin chain. You put a scare into her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 Johnny said. He felt sick and chilly with relief. \u0027I\u0027m sorry but I\u0027m glad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You had some kind of a flash, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 Chuck looked at Johnny, then at his father, and then slowly back to Johnny. \u0027I felt it. It was bad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sometimes people do. I understand it\u0027s sort of nasty.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I wouldn\u0027t want it to happen again,\u0027 Chuck said. \u0027But hey... that place isn\u0027t really going to burn down, is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027You want to just keep away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But...\u0027 He looked at his father, troubled. \u0027The senior class reserved the whole damn place. The school encourages that, you know. It\u0027s safer than twenty or thirty different parties and a lot of people drinking on the back roads: There\u0027s apt to be ...\u0027 Chuck fell silent for a moment and then began to look frightened. \u0027There\u0027s apt to be two hundred couples there,\u0027 he said. \u0027Dad...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think he believes any of this,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n Roger stood up and smiled. \u0027Well, let\u0027s take a ride over to Somersworth and talk to the manager of the place,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was a dull lawn party, anyway. And if you two still feel the same coming back, we can have everyone over here tonight.\u0027\\n\\n He glanced at Johnny.\\n\\n \u0027Only condition being that you have to stay sober and help chaperon, fellow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll be glad to,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027But why, if you don\u0027t believe it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For your peace of mind,\u0027 Roger said, \u0027and for Chuck\u0027s And so that, when nothing happens tonight, I can say I told you so and then just laaaugh my ass off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, whatever, thanks.\u0027 He was trembling worse than ever now that the relief had come, but his headache had retreated to a dull throb.\\n\\n \u0027One thing up front, though,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027I don\u0027t think we stand a snowball\u0027s chance in hell of getting the owner to cancel on your unsubstantiated word, Johnny. This is probably one of his big business nights each year.\u0027\\n\\n Chuck said, \u0027Well, we could work something out...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, we could tell him a ....... spin some kind of yarn ...\\n\\n \u0027Lie, you mean? No, I won\u0027t do that. Don\u0027t ask me, Chuck.\u0027\\n\\n Chuck nodded. \u0027All right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We better get going,\u0027 Roger said briskly. \u0027It\u0027s quarter of five. We\u0027ll take the Mercedes over to Somersworth.\u0027\\n\\n 3.\\n\\n Bruce Carrick, the owner-manager, was tending bar when the three of them came in at five-forty. Johnny\u0027s heart sank a little when he read the sign posted outside the lounge doors: PRIVATE PARTY THIS EVENING ONLY 7 PM TO CLOSING SEE YOU TOMORROW.\\n\\n Carrick was not exactly being run into the ground. He was serving a few workmen who were drinking beer and watching the early news, and three couples who were having cocktails. He listened to Johnny\u0027s story with a face that grew ever more incredulous. When he had finished, Carrick said: \u0027You say Smith\u0027s your name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, that\u0027s right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mr. Smith, come on over to this window with me.\u0027\\n\\n He led Johnny to the lobby window, by the cloakroom door.\\n\\n \u0027Look out there, Mr. Smith, and tell me what you see.\\n\\n Johnny looked out, knowing what he would see. Route 9 ran west, now drying from a light afternoon sprinkle. Above, the sky was perfectly clear. The thunderheads had passed.\\n\\n \u0027Not much. At least, not now. But...\\n\\n \u0027But nothing.\u0027 Bruce Carrick said. \u0027You know what I think? You want to know frankly? I think you\u0027re a nut. Why you picked me for this royal screwing I don\u0027t know or care. But if you got a second, sonny, I\u0027ll tell you the facts of life. The senior class has paid me six hundred and fifty bucks for this bash. They\u0027ve hired a pretty good rock \u0027n roll band, Oak, from up in Maine. The food\u0027s out there in the freezer, all ready to go into the microwave. The salads are on ice. Drinks are extra, and most of these kids are over eighteen and can drink all they want ... and tonight they will, who can blame them, you only graduate from a high school once. I\u0027ll take in two thousand dollars in the lounge tonight, no sweat. I got two extra barmen coming in. I got six waitresses and a hostess. If I should cancel this thing now, I lose the whole night. plus I got to pay back the six-fifty I already took for the meal. I don\u0027t even get my regular dinner crowd because that sign\u0027s been there all week. Do you get the picture?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are there lightning rods on this place?\u0027 Johnny asked.\\n\\n Carrick threw his hands up. \u0027I tell this guy the facts of life and he wants to discuss lightning rods! Yeah, I got lightning rods! A guy came in here, before I added on, must be five years ago now. He gave me a song-and-dance about improving my insurance rates. So I bought the goddam lightning rods! Are you happy? Jesus Christ!\u0027 He looked at Roger and Chuck. \u0027What are you two guys doing? Why are you letting this asshole run around loose? Get out, why don\u0027t you? I got a business to run.\\n\\n \u0027Johnny...\u0027 Chuck began.\\n\\n \u0027Never mind,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027Let\u0027s go. Thank you for your time, Mr. Carrick, and for your polite and sympathetic attention.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks for nothing,\u0027 Carrick said. \u0027Bunch of nuts!\u0027 He strode back toward the lounge.\\n\\n The three of them went out. Chuck looked doubtfully at the flawless sky. Johnny started toward the car, looking only at his feet, feeling stupid and defeated. His headache thudded sickly against his temples. Roger was standing with his hands in his back pockets, looking up at the long, low roof of the building.\\n\\n \u0027What are you looking at, Dad?\u0027 Chuck asked.\\n\\n \u0027There are no lightning rods up there,\u0027 Roger Chatsworth said thoughtfully. \u0027No lightning rods at all.\u0027\\n\\n 4.\\n\\n The three of them sat in the living room of the big house, Chuck by the telephone. He looked doubtfully at his father. \u0027Most of them won\u0027t want to change their plans this late,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve got plans to go out, that\u0027s all,\u0027 Roger said. \u0027They can just as easily come here.\u0027\\n\\n Chuck shrugged and began dialing.\\n\\n They ended up with about half the couples who had been planning to go to Cathy\u0027s that graduation evening, and Johnny was never really sure why they came. Some probably came simply because it sounded like a more interesting party and because the drinks were on the house. But word traveled fast, and the parents of a good many of the kids here had been at the lawn party that afternoon - as a result, Johnny spent much of the evening feeling like an exhibit in a glass case. Roger sat in the corner on a stool, drinking a vodka martini. His face was a studied mask.\\n\\n Around quarter of eight he walked across the big bar/ playroom combination that took up three-quarters of the basement level, bent close to Johnny and bellowed over the roar of Elton John, \u0027You want to go upstairs and play some cribbage?\u0027\\n\\n Johnny nodded gratefully.\\n\\n Shelley was in the kitchen, writing letters. She looked up when they came in, and smiled. \u0027I thought you two masochists were going to stay down there all night. It\u0027s not really necessary, you know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry about all of this,\u0027 Johnny said. \u0027I know how crazy it must seem.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It does seem crazy,\u0027 Shelley said. \u0027No reason not to be candid about that. But having them here is really rather nice. I don\u0027t mind.\u0027\\n\\n Thunder rumbled outside. Johnny looked around. Shelley saw it and smiled a little. Roger had left to hunt for the cribbage board in the dining room welsh dresser.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just passing over, you know,\u0027 she said. \u0027A little thunder and a sprinkle of rain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n She signed her letter in a comfortable sprawl, folded it, sealed it, addressed it, stamped it. \u0027You really experienced something, didn\u0027t you, Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A momentary faintness,\u0027 she said. \u0027Possibly caused by a dietary deficiency. You\u0027re much too thin, Johnny. It might have been a hallucination, mightn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think so.\u0027\\n\\n Outside, thunder growled again, but distantly. \u0027I\u0027m just as glad to have him home. I don\u0027t believe in astrology and palmistry and clairvoyance and all of that, but ... I\u0027m just as glad to have him home. He\u0027s our only chick... a pretty damned big chick now, I suspect you re thinking, but it\u0027s easy to remember him riding the little kids\u0027 merry-go-round in the town park in his short pants. Too easy, perhaps. And it\u0027s nice to be able to share the the last rite of his boyhood with him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s nice that you feel that way,\u0027 Johnny said. Suddenly he was frightened to find himself close to tears. In the last six or eight months it seemed to him that his emotional control had slipped several notches.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve been good for Chuck. I don\u0027t mean just teaching him to read. In a lot of ways.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I like Chuck.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027I know you do.\u0027\\n\\n Roger came back with the cribbage board and a transistor radio tuned to WMTQ, a classical station that broadcast from the top of Mount Washington.\\n\\n \u0027A little antidote for Elton John, Aerosmith, Foghat, et al,\u0027 he said. \u0027How does a dollar a game sound, Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It sounds fine.\u0027\\n\\n Roger sat down, rubbing his hands. \u0027Oh, you\u0027re goin home poor,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n 5.\\n\\n They played cribbage and the evening passed. Between each game one of them would go downstairs and make sure no one had decided to dance on the pool table or go out back for a little party of their own. \u0027No one is going to impregnate anyone else at this party if I can help it,\u0027 Roger said.\\n\\n Shelley had gone into the living room to read. Once an hour the music on the radio would stop and the news would come on and Johnny\u0027s attention would falter a little. But there was nothing about Cathy\u0027s in Somersworth - not at eight, nine, or ten.\\n\\n After the ten o\u0027clock news, Roger said: \u0027Getting ready to hedge your prediction a little, Johnny?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n The weather forecast was for scattered thundershowers, clearing after midnight.\\n\\n The steady bass signature of K.C. and the Sunshine Band came up through the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Party\u0027s getting loud,\u0027 Johnny remarked.\\n\\n \u0027The hell with that,\u0027 Roger said, grinning. \u0027The party\u0027s getting drunk. Spider Parmeleau is passed out in the corner and somebody\u0027s using him for a beer coaster. Oh, they\u0027ll have big heads in the morning, you want to believe it. I remember at my own graduation party...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here is a bulletin from the WMTQ newsroom,\u0027 the radio said.\\n\\n Johnny, who had been shuffling, sprayed cards all over the floor.\\n\\n \u0027Relax, it\u0027s probably just something about that kidnapping down in Florida.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 Johnny said.\\n\\n The broadcaster said: \u0027It appears at this moment that the worst fire in New Hampshire history has claimed more than seventy-five young lives in the border town of Somersworth, New Hampshire. The fire occurred at a restaurant-lounge called Cathy\u0027s. A graduation party was in progress when the fire broke out. Somersworth fire chief Milton Hovey told reporters they have no suspicions of arson; they believe that the fire was almost certainly caused by a bolt of lightning.\u0027\\n\\n Roger Chatsworth\u0027s face was draining of all color. He sat bolt upright in his kitchen chair, his eyes fixed on a point somewhere above Johnny\u0027s head. His hands lay loosely on the table. From below them came the babble of conversation and laughter, intermingled now with the sound of Bruce Springsteen.\\n\\n Shelley came into the room. She looked from her husband to Johnny and then back again. \u0027What is it? What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shut up,\u0027 Roger said.\\n\\n \u0027.... is still blazing, and Hovey said that a final tally of the dead will probably not be known until early morning. It is known that over thirty people, mostly members of the Durham High School senior class, have been taken to hospitals in surrounding areas to be treated for burns. Forty people, also mostly graduating students, escaped from small bathroom windows at the rear of the lounge, but others were apparently trapped in fatal pile-ups at the...\\n\\n \u0027Was it Cathy\u0027s?\u0027 Shelley Chatsworth screamed. \u0027Was it that place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Roger said. He seemed eerily calm. \u0027Yes, it was.\u0027\\n\\n Downstairs there had been a momentary silence. It was followed by a running thud of footsteps coming up the stairs. The kitchen door burst open and Chuck came in, looking for his mother.\\n\\n \u0027Mom? What is it? What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It appears that we may owe you for our son\u0027s life,\u0027 Roger said in that same eerily calm voice. Johnny had never seen a face that white. Roger looked like a ghastly living waxwork.\\n\\n \u0027It burned?\u0027 Chuck\u0027s voice was incredulous. Behind him, others were crowding up the stairs now, whispering in low, affrighted voices. \u0027Are you saying it burned down?\u0027\\n\\n No one answered. And then, suddenly, from somewhere behind him, Patty Strachan began to talk in a high, hysterical voice. \u0027It\u0027s his fault, that guy there! He made it happen! He set it on fire by his mind, just like in that book Carrie. You murderer! Killer! You ...\\n\\n Roger turned toward her. \u0027SHUT UP!\u0027 He roared.\\n\\n Patty collapsed into wild sobs.\\n\\n \u0027Burned?\u0027 Chuck repeated. He seemed to be asking himself now, inquiring if that could possibly be the right word.\\n\\n \u0027Roger?\u0027 Shelley whispered. \u0027Rog? Honey?\u0027\\n\\n There was a growing mutter on the stairs, and in the playroom below, like a stir of leaves. The stereo clicked off. The voices murmured.\\n\\n Was Mike there? Shannon went, didn\u0027t she? Are you sure? Yes, I was all ready to leave when Chuck called me. My mother was there when that guy freaked out and she said she felt like a goose was walking on her grave, she asked me to come here instead. Was Casey there? Was Ray there? Was Maureen Ontello there? Oh my God, was she? Was...\\n\\n Roger stood up slowly and turned around. \u0027I suggest,\u0027 he said, \u0027that we find the soberest people here to drive and that we all go down to the hospital. They\u0027ll need blood donors.\u0027\\n\\n Johnny sat like a stone. He found himself wondering if he would ever move again. Outside, thunder rumbled.\\n\\n And followed on its heels like an inner clap, he heard his dying mother\u0027s voice:\\n\\n Do your duty, John. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-24.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
