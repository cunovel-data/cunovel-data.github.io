He walked around to the parking lot and hoisted his two-hundred-pound bulk behind the wheel of his Chevy Caprice and started the engine. All according to routine. What was not according to routine was the face that appeared suddenly in the rear-view mirror an olive-skinned, stubbled face framed by long hair and set off by eyes every bit as green as those of Sarah Hazlett or Chuck Chatsworth. Warren Richardson had not been so badly scared since he was a kid, and his heart took a great, unsteady leap in his chest.\\n\\n \u0027Howdy,\u0027 said Sonny Elliman, leaning over the seat.\\n\\n \u0027Who ...\u0027 was all Richardson managed, uttering the word in a terrified hiss of breath. His heart was pounding so hard that dark specks danced and pulsed before his eyes in rhythm with its beat. He was afraid he might have a heart attack.\\n\\n \u0027Easy,\u0027 the man who had been hiding in his back seat said. \u0027Go easy, man. Lighten up.\u0027\\n\\n And Warren Richardson felt an absurd emotion. It was gratitude. The man who had scared him wasn\u0027t going to scare him anymore. He must be a nice man, he must be-\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 he managed this time.\\n\\n \u0027A friend,\u0027 Sonny said.\\n\\n Richardson started to turn and fingers as hard as pincers bit into the sides of his flabby neck. The pain was excruciating. Richardson drew breath in a convulsive, heaving whine.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t need to turn around, man. You can see me as well as you need to see me in your rear-view. Can you dig that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Richardson gasped. \u0027Yes yes yes just let me go I\u0027\\n\\n The pincers began to ease up, and again he felt that irrational sense of gratitude. But he no longer doubted that the man in the back seat was dangerous, or that he was in this car on purpose although he couldn\u0027t think why anyone would -And then he could think why someone would, at least why someone might, it wasn\u0027t the sort of thing you\u0027d expect any ordinary candidate for office to do, but Greg Stillson wasn\u0027t ordinary, Greg Stillson was a crazy man, and-\\n\\n Very softly, Warren Richardson began to blubber.\\n\\n \u0027Got to talk to you, man,\u0027 Sonny said. His voice was kind and regretful, but in the rear-view mirror his eyes glittered green. amusement. \u0027Got to talk to you like a Dutch uncle.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Stillson, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s - .\\n\\n The pincers were suddenly back, the man\u0027s fingers were buried in his neck, and Richardson uttered a high-pitched shriek.\\n\\n \u0027No names,\u0027 the terrible man in the back seat told him in that same kind-yet-regretful voice. \u0027You draw your own conclusions, Mr. Richardson, but keep the names to yourself. I\u0027ve got one thumb just over your carotid artery and my fingers are over by your jugular, and I can turn you into a human turnip, if I want to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you want?\u0027 Richardson asked. He did not exactly moan, but it was a near thing; he had never felt more like moaning in his life. He could not believe that this was happening in the parking lot behind his real estate office in Capital City. New Hampshire. on a bright summer\u0027s day. He could see the clock set into the red brick of the town hall tower. It said ten minutes to five. At home, Norma would be putting the pork chops, nicely coated with Shake \u0027n Bake, into the oven to broil. Sean would be watching Sesame Street on TV. And there was a man behind him threatening to cut off the flow of blood to his brain and turn him into an idiot. No, it wasn\u0027t real; it was like a nightmare. The sort of nightmare that makes you moan in your sleep.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t want anything,\u0027 Sonny Elliman said. \u0027It\u0027s all a matter of what you want.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027 But he was terribly afraid that he did.\\n\\n \u0027That story in the New Hampshire Journal about funny real estate deals,\u0027 Sonny said. \u0027You surely did have a lot to say, Mr. Richardson, didn\u0027t you? Especially about certain people.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That stuff about the Capital Mail, for instance. Hinting around about kickbacks and payoffs and one hand washing the other. All that horseshit.\u0027 The fingers tightened on Richardson\u0027s neck again, and this time he did moan. But he hadn\u0027t been identified in the story, he had just been \u0027an informed source\u0027. How had they known? How had Greg Stillson known?\\n\\n The man behind him began to speak rapidly into Warren Richardson\u0027s ear now, his breath warm and ticklish.\\n\\n \u0027You could get certain people into trouble talking horseshit like that, Mr. Richardson, you know it? People running for public office, let\u0027s say. Running for office, it\u0027s like playing bridge, you dig it? You\u0027re vulnerable. People can sling mud and it sticks, especially these days. Now, there\u0027s no trouble yet. I\u0027m happy to tell you that, because if there was trouble, you might be sitting here picking your teeth out of your nose instead of having a nice little talk with me.\u0027\\n\\n In spite of his pounding heart, in spite of his fear, Richardson said: \u0027This ... this person ... young man, you\u0027re crazy if you think you can protect him. He\u0027s played it as fast and loose as a snakeoil salesman in a southern town. Sooner or later...\u0027\\n\\n A thumb slammed into his ear, grinding. The pain was immense, unbelievable. Richardson\u0027s head slammed into his window and he cried out. Blindly, he groped for the horn ring.\\n\\n \u0027You blow that horn, I\u0027ll kill you,\u0027 the voice whispered.\\n\\n Richardson let his hands drop. The thumb eased up.\\n\\n \u0027You ought to use Q-tips in there, man,\u0027 the voice said. \u0027I got wax all over my thumb. Pretty gross.\u0027\\n\\n Warren Richardson began to cry weakly. He was powerless to stop himself. Tears coursed down his fat cheeks. \u0027Please don\u0027t hurt me anymore,\u0027 he said. \u0027Please don\u0027t. Please.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like I said,\u0027 Sonny told him. \u0027It\u0027s all a matter of what you want. Your job isn\u0027t to worry what someone else might say about ....... these certain people. Your job is to watch what comes out of your own mouth. Your job is to think before you talk the next time that guy from the Journal comes around. You might think about how easy it is to find out who \"an informed source\" is. Or you might think about what a bummer it would be if your house burned down. Or you might think about how you\u0027d pay for plastic surgery if someone threw some battery acid in your wife\u0027s face.\u0027\\n\\n The man behind Richardson was panting now. He sounded like an animal in a jungle.\\n\\n \u0027Or you might think, you know, dig it, how easy it would be for someone to come along and pick up your son on his way home from kindergarten.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you say that!\u0027 Richardson cried hoarsely. \u0027Don\u0027t you say that, you slimy bastard!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All I\u0027m saying is that you want to think about what you want,\u0027 Sonny said. \u0027An election, it\u0027s an all-American thing, you know? Especially in a Bicentennial year. Everyone should have a good time. No one has a good time if numb fucks like you start telling a lot of lies. Numb jealous fucks like you.\u0027\\n\\n The hand went away altogether. The rear door opened. Oh thank God, thank God.\\n\\n \u0027You just want to think,\u0027 Sonny Elliman repeated. \u0027Now do we have an understanding?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Richardson whispered. \u0027But if you think Gr. a certain person can be elected using these tactics, you\u0027re badly mistaken.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Sonny said. \u0027You\u0027re the one who\u0027s mistaken. Because everyone\u0027s having a good time. Make sure that you\u0027re not left out.\u0027\\n\\n Richardson didn\u0027t answer. He sat rigid behind the steering wheel, his neck throbbing, staring at the clock on the Town Office Building as if it were the only sane thing left in his life. It was now almost five of five. The pork chops would be in by now.\\n\\n The man in the back seat said one more thing and then he was gone, striding away rapidly, his long hair swinging against the collar of his shirt, not looking back. He went around the corner of the building and out of sight.\\n\\n The last thing he had said to Warren Richardson was:\\n\\n \u0027Q-Tips.\u0027\\n\\n Richardson began to shake all over and it was a long time before he could drive. His first clear feeling was anger - terrible anger. The impulse that came with it was to drive directly to the Capital City police department (housed in the building below the dock) and report what had happened - the threats on his wife and son, the physical abuse - and on whose behalf it had been done.\\n\\n You might think about how you\u0027d pay for plastic surgery ... or how easy it would be for someone to come\u0027 along and pick up your son...\\n\\n But why? Why take the chance? What he had said to that thug was just the plain, unvarnished truth. Everyone in southern New Hampshire real estate knew that Stillson had been running a shell game, reaping short-term profits that would land him in jail, not sooner or later, but sooner or even sooner. His campaign was an exercise in idiocy. And now strong-arm tactics! No one could get away with that for long in America - and especially not in New England.\\n\\n But let someone else blow the whistle.\\n\\n Someone with less to lose.\\n\\n Warren Richardson started his car and went home to his pork chops and said nothing at all. Someone else would surely put a stop to it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone/page-19.html","bookId":2576,"book":{"id":2576,"title":"The Dead Zone","description":"Storyline: Johnny, the small boy who skated at breakneck speed into an accident that for one horrifying moment plunged him into The Dead Zone. \\n Johnny Smith, the small-town schoolteacher who spun the wheel of fortune and won a four-and-a-half-year trip into The Dead Zone. \\n John Smith, who awakened from an interminable coma with an accursed power—the power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dead-zone.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-dead-zone.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:53 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:02:56 PM"}}
