{"id":7933,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. MAURICE AND BESSIE BENTON.","content":"Gilbert could not help wondering how Maurice and Mr. James Grey were brought together, and how it happened that the former became his uncle\u0027s agent and accomplice. He knew, however, that Maurice never liked him, and guessed that this had been an inducement. \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"if there is any chance of his communicating my plans to Mr. Grey? It will be best for me to keep him in ignorance of my destination.\" When, therefore, he was ready to start, he resolved only to tell him that he was going to St. Louis. This was, in truth, his first destination, but, as we know, he intended to go farther. Maurice, who didn\u0027t before know of Gilbert\u0027s plans, was surprised when the latter walked up to him and said: \"I must bid you good-by for a time, Maurice.\" \"Are you going away?\" exclaimed his fellow-clerk, staring at him in amazement. \"Yes, I am going away for a short time.\" \"Where?\" \"To St. Louis.\" \"On business for Mr. Ferguson?\" \"No, it is on my own business.\" \"I suppose it has something to do with his uncle,\" thought Maurice, but he thought it most prudent not to say this. \"How long do you expect to be gone?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t know—it depends on how successful I am.\" \"Bessie Benton will miss you,\" said Maurice, sarcastically. \"So she said,\" answered Gilbert quietly, appreciating his motive. \"When did you see her?\" asked Maurice, with a twinge of jealousy. \"Last evening.\" This made Maurice feel very uncomfortable. Bessie had grown very pretty, and he admired her more than ever, but with a strange perversity, as he thought, she didn\u0027t appear to reciprocate the feeling. On the other hand, she appeared to care a good deal more for Gilbert\u0027s society than for that of Maurice. It came to him now, with a feeling of joy, that when Gilbert was away Bessie would naturally turn to him for companionship. \"I think I shall go up there this evening myself,\" he said. (It must be explained that Maurice no longer boarded at his uncle\u0027s.) \"If you have any message to send, I can take it.\" \"Give Bessie my love,\" said Gilbert, a little mischievously, knowing that Maurice would never carry such a message. \"I will remember you to Miss Benton,\" said Maurice, with dignity. \"Oh! don\u0027t take the trouble,\" said Gilbert, carelessly; \"it isn\u0027t at all necessary.\" \"Then I won\u0027t.\" \"Just as you please.\" \"I never saw such an amount of cheek in my life,\" said Maurice to himself. \"I\u0027ve a great mind to drop a hint to Bessie. She notices him altogether too much.\" So Maurice, fulfilling his determination of calling that evening, managed to introduce the subject. \"Gilbert Grey called on you last evening, didn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes; he is going away. He came to say good-by.\" \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t miss him much.\" \"Why not? Are you not a good deal together?\" \"In the store we are together. Out of it, I don\u0027t care to keep his company.\" \"Why not?\" \"He isn\u0027t my style.\" \"If it means that he does not resemble you, Maurice, I think you are right.\" \"He is very much stuck up.\" \"Really, Maurice—I hope you will excuse my saying it—I think that charge could be brought against you more justly.\" \"Do you mean to say I am stuck up?\" asked Maurice, indignantly. \"Perhaps it is only your manner.\" \"But do you think I seem so?\" \"More than Gilbert.\" \"You seem very familiar with Grey, to call him Gilbert.\" \"Of course I am familiar with him. Why shouldn\u0027t I be?\" \"It doesn\u0027t show very good taste on your part.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. Gilbert is popular in society. You know that at parties he never has any difficulty in filling up his card.\" Maurice did know that at the parties when both were present, Gilbert was received with much more favor than himself, and this was one of the circumstances that made him angry with his fellow-clerk. Few can pardon a wound to their self-love. \"It only shows that humbugs flourish best in the world,\" he said. \"Do you call Gilbert a humbug?\" asked Bessie, her fair face flushed with indignation. \"Yes, I do.\" \"Then,\" she said, spiritedly, \"it only shows your jealousy and envy of him, because he is better looking and more popular than you. Jealousy is hateful, I think,\" said the little lady, tossing her head with emphasis. \"I hope when I am jealous it will be of somebody better than Gilbert Grey,\" said Maurice, angry and mortified because Bessie had referred to Gilbert as better looking and more popular than himself. \"It seems to me you are making yourself very disagreeable to-night, Maurice,\" said his cousin, pettishly. \"If you knew what an impudent message he sent to you, you might change your mind about him.\" \"What impudent message did he send? I don\u0027t believe he sent any.\" \"Then you\u0027re mistaken. He said, with his own lips, \u0027Give my love to Bessie.\u0027\" A smile rippled over the face of Bessie Benton, and there was a little blush, too. Evidently she was not at all displeased at the message. \"Was that the impudent message you spoke of?\" she asked. \"Yes.\" \"Then I don\u0027t see what impudence there is in it.\" \"What right had he to call you Bessie?\" \"Don\u0027t you call me Bessie?\" \"That\u0027s different—I am your cousin.\" \"Well, I call him Gilbert. So we\u0027re even.\" \"He had no right to send you his love. It isn\u0027t proper.\" \"Really, Maurice, I ought to be very much obliged to you for taking such good care of me, and teaching me what\u0027s proper, and what isn\u0027t. But, if you don\u0027t think the message a proper one, what made you give it to me?\" she asked, smiling. \"I wish I hadn\u0027t,\" thought Maurice, who began to see that he had been hurried by his anger into making a mistake. \"I thought you would resent it,\" he said, aloud. \"You can give Gilbert my love, when you write to him,\" said his cousin, provokingly. \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t write to him; and, if I did, I wouldn\u0027t send him that message.\" \"You are very obliging.\" \"If you knew as much of Gilbert Grey as I do, you wouldn\u0027t think so much of him.\" \"Do you know anything very dreadful about him?\" asked Bessie, incredulously. \"I know why he has gone to St. Louis.\" \"Is it to commit murder, or robbery, or for any other dreadful reason?\" \"It is to commit robbery!\" \"Don\u0027t make a fool of yourself, Maurice Walton,\" said Bessie, sharply. \"I don\u0027t know what else you can call it,\" persisted Maurice. \"He is going to try to get possession of some property that don\u0027t belong to him.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"He knows of a rich gentleman of the same name, and he has forged a paper, and is trying to make out that he is his nephew, though it is well known that the nephew died years ago.\" \"Is that his reason for going to St. Louis?\" asked Bessie, interested. \"Yes.\" \"How do you know?—did he tell you?\" \"I have the best authority for my statements,\" said Maurice, who, for reasons known to the reader, did not like to tell how he gained the information; \"but I am not at liberty to say more.\" \"You are very mysterious.\" \"What I have told you is the truth. If you don\u0027t call it robbery, I do.\" \"All I have got to say is, that if Gilbert claims to be anybody\u0027s nephew, I have no doubt he is. He wouldn\u0027t forge a paper for anything.\" \"That\u0027s where you and I don\u0027t agree.\" \"I think it\u0027s rather mean of you, Maurice Walton, to come here to slander a friend.\" \"He isn\u0027t my friend. Perhaps he is yours.\" \"You are right there,\" said Bessie, firmly. \"He is my friend.\" \"Perhaps, when he gets that fortune, you\u0027ll marry him?\" said Maurice, sarcastically. \"He hasn\u0027t asked me yet,\" said Bessie, blushing. This was too much for Maurice. He began to see that Bessie liked Gilbert more than he suspected, and that, by his blundering, he had only helped matters along. He sulkily bade his cousin good-night, and, returning home, bethought himself of his promise to Mr. Grey, and, though it was late, sat down and wrote him a letter.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83492.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
