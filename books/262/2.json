{"id":7909,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. STRUCK DOWN.","content":"No sooner had Tom left the room than the old man rose slowly from his couch, and, walking feebly to the door, bolted it; then, going to a corner of the room, he lifted a plank from the flooring, and, thrusting his hand beneath, drew up a tin box. He opened this with a small key which he wore about his neck, suspended by a cord, and revealed a heap of silver and copper coins, filling the box two-thirds full. Upon this his eyes were fixed with eager and gloating satisfaction. \"It\u0027s all mine!\" he muttered, joyfully. \"Tom doesn\u0027t know about it. He mustn\u0027t know—he might want me to spend it. I will count it.\" He took it out by handfuls, and began to count it for at least the hundredth time, putting together coins of similar value in little piles, till there was a circle of silver and copper about him. It was a work of time for the old man, and probably half an hour was consumed before he had finished his task. \"Ninety-nine dollars!\" he exclaimed, in alarm, at the end of the calculation. \"Somebody has robbed me; I ought to have twenty-five cents more. Could Tom have got at the box? Maybe I have made a mistake. I will count again.\" With nervous fingers he recommenced the count, fearing that he had met with a loss. He was half through his task, when a knock was heard at the door. The old man started in agitation, and glanced apprehensively at the door. \"Who\u0027s there?\" he asked, in quivering accents. \"It\u0027s I,\" answered a hearty voice, which Jacob readily recognized as that of Mrs. Flanagan. \"You can\u0027t come in,\" said the old man, peevishly. \"What do you want?\" \"I only came to ask how ye are, and if I can do anything for ye.\" \"No, you can\u0027t. I\u0027m well—no, I\u0027m sick, and I\u0027d rather be left alone.\" \"All right,\" said the good woman, in no wise offended, for she pitied the old man. \"If you want anything, jist stomp on the floor, and I\u0027ll hear ye, and come up.\" \"Yes,\" said Jacob, hastily. \"Now go down—that\u0027s a good woman. I want to go to sleep.\" \"Poor craythur!\" said Mrs. Flanagan, to herself. \"It\u0027s little he enjoys the world, which is a blessin\u0027, as he will soon have to lave it.\" \"I hope she isn\u0027t looking through the keyhole,\" thought Jacob, in alarm. \"She might see my money.\" But the footsteps of the good woman descending the stairs came to his ears, and reassured him. \"It\u0027s well I locked the door,\" he said to himself. \"I wouldn\u0027t want it known that I had all this money, or it wouldn\u0027t be safe. It\u0027s taken me a long time to get it, and it isn\u0027t quite a hundred dollars. If I had seventy-five cents more\"—he had by this time found the missing quarter—\"it would make just a hundred. If Tom wouldn\u0027t mind, I could get it easily by begging. I might have it by to-morrow. I wonder if he would care much,\" muttered the old man, as he put back the coins carefully into the tin box. \"I—I think I\u0027ll go out a little while. He\u0027ll never know it.\" By this time he had locked the box and replaced it beneath the flooring, restoring the plank to its original place. \"I\u0027ll lie down a little while till I feel strong,\" he muttered, \"then I\u0027ll go out. If I go up on Broadway, Tom won\u0027t see me. He ought not to mind my begging. I am too weak to work, and it\u0027s the only way I can get money.\" He lay down on the bed, and, after his exertion, small as it was, the rest was grateful to him. But the thought haunted him continually that he needed but seventy-five cents to make up his hoard to a hundred dollars, and the eager desire prompted him to forsake his rest and go out into the streets. After awhile he rose from his bed. \"I am rested enough now,\" he said. \"I think I can go out for a little while. I will get back before Tom comes home.\" He took an old battered hat from a nail on which it hung, and with feeble step left the room, grasping the banister to steady his steps as he descended the stairs. Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s door was open, and, though the old man made but little noise, she heard it. She lifted both hands in amazement when she saw him. \"Shure ye are too wake to go out,\" said she. \"Come, now, go up and lie on the bed till ye are better. Tom\u0027ll be mad if he knows ye have gone out.\" \"Ye needn\u0027t tell him,\" said Jacob, hastily. \"I want to breathe the fresh air; it\u0027ll do me good.\" \"Shure you\u0027re not fit to go alone; I\u0027ll send my Mike wid you. He\u0027s only six, but he\u0027s a smart lad.\" \"I\u0027d rather go alone,\" said Jacob, who was afraid the little boy would report his begging. \"I—I am stronger than you think. I won\u0027t be gone long.\" Mrs. Flanagan saw that he was obstinate, and she did not press the point. But after he had got down stairs she called Mike, and said: \"Mike, dear, go after the old man, and see where he goes; but don\u0027t you let him see you. I\u0027ll give you a penny to buy candy when you get back.\" Mike was easily persuaded, for he had the weakness for candy common to boys of his age, of whatever grade, and he proceeded to follow his mother\u0027s directions. When Jacob got to the foot of the lowest staircase he felt more fatigued than he expected, but his resolution remained firm. He must have the seventy-five cents before night. To-morrow he could rest. Let him but increase his hoard to a hundred dollars, and he would be content. It was not without a painful effort that he dragged himself as far as Broadway, though the distance was scarcely quarter of a mile. Little Mike followed him, partly because his mother directed him to do it, partly because, young as he was, he was curious to learn where Jacob was going, and what he was going to do. His curiosity was soon gratified. He saw the old man remove his battered hat, and hold it out in mute appeal to the passers-by. It was not long before Jacob received ten cents. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked another passer-by, five minutes later. \"I\u0027m sick and poor,\" whined Jacob. \"Well, there\u0027s something for you,\" and the old man, to his joy, found his hoard increased twenty-five cents. This he put into his pocket, thinking that he would be more likely to inspire compassion, and obtain fresh contributions, if only the ten cents were visible. He did not get another contribution as large. Still, more than one passer-by, attracted by his wretched look, dropped something into his hat, till the sum he desired was made up. He had secured the seventy-five cents necessary to make up the hundred dollars; but his craving was not satisfied. He thought he would stay half an hour longer, and secure a little more. He was tired, but it would not take long, and he could rest long enough afterward. An unlucky impulse led him to cross the street to the opposite side, which he fancied would be more favorable to his purpose. I say unlucky, for he was struck down, when half way across, by some stage horses, and trampled under foot. There was a rush to his rescue, and he was lifted up and carried into a neighboring shop. \"Does anybody know who he is, or where he lives?\" asked a policeman. \"I know him,\" said little Mike, who had witnessed the accident, and followed the crowd in. \"His name is old Jacob, and he lives in Carter\u0027s alley.\" \"Is there anybody to take care of him—any wife or daughter?\" asked the physician. Mike explained that he had only a grandson, and the physician thereupon directed that he be carried to Bellevue Hospital, while Mike ran home to bear the important news to his mother.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83468.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
