{"id":7943,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. HUGH BETRAYS HIS PRINCIPAL.","content":"\"Follow me!\" said Hugh Trimble to Gilbert. \"Where are you going to lead me?\" \"Never you mind. Come along.\" Gilbert saw that resistance would be useless, and he obeyed. His companion plunged into the woods, looking back occasionally to see that he was following. He kept on for about half a mile as near as Gilbert could judge, when they came to a small clearing, in the midst of which was a dilapidated log hut. It was no longer occupied, but had been deserted by the former occupant, who had gone across the Mississippi to regions yet unexplored years before. \"Go in there,\" said Hugh. Gilbert entered. He saw nothing but bare walls, all furniture having been removed when it was deserted. Our hero looked around him curiously, and then at his conductor inquiringly. He was not long in doubt as to his intention. Hugh drew a strong cord from his pocket, and drew near him. \"What are you going to do?\" asked Gilbert. \"Tie your hands and feet,\" was the reply. Gilbert shrank back. \"Don\u0027t do that,\" he said. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to have you run away,\" growled Hugh. \"I won\u0027t run away. I shall be released this afternoon at any rate, and I can stand captivity till then.\" \"How do you know you will get free this afternoon?\" \"You promised to let me go when my uncle brought the money.\" \"Your uncle?\" repeated Hugh, exhibiting surprise, fixing his eyes keenly upon our hero. \"Yes, he is my uncle, but he does not acknowledge me yet.\" \"Humph!\" said Hugh, thoughtfully to himself. \"Suppose he does own you, what then?\" \"It is a secret.\" \"You\u0027d better tell me. I have a reason for asking.\" \"I have a claim to the property which my uncle possesses.\" \"That\u0027s it. I understand it now.\" \"What do you understand?\" \"Suppose you was to die, what then?\" \"There would be nobody to disturb my uncle in the possession of his property.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t cry much if you was to die.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Gilbert, unpleasantly impressed by the man\u0027s tone. \"He wants you dead—that\u0027s the long and short of it.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" said Gilbert, shuddering. \"You can have no cause to say this. He can\u0027t be so wicked.\" \"Look here, young one,\" said Hugh, \"I\u0027ll tell you a secret. You take me for a robber, don\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"In course you do. Now I\u0027m going to surprise you. My stopping your mouth to-day was all a put-up job.\" \"You don\u0027t mean that my uncle engaged you to do it?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"What was his object?\" \"He don\u0027t mean to come back for you. He wants me to kill you.\" \"You don\u0027t mean that?\" said Gilbert, horror-struck. \"Yes, I do. He\u0027s goin\u0027 to give me a thousand dollars.\" \"And you agreed to do it?\" \"Yes, I agreed to do it.\" \"Would you stain your hands with murder for a thousand dollars?\" asked Gilbert, solemnly. \"What can I do? I\u0027m a poor man. Fortune has gone agin me all my life. There ain\u0027t no other way I can get money. If I was well off I wouldn\u0027t do it.\" \"Good Heaven! To think my uncle should be capable of such wickedness.\" \"It\u0027s just as bad for him, ain\u0027t it? He hires me to kill you for the sake of money. What\u0027s the odds?\" \"He is worse than you. He knows that I would not strip him of everything, even if I succeed.\" \"What\u0027s your chances, young one? Have you got a good case?\" \"If I hadn\u0027t, he wouldn\u0027t conspire for my death.\" \"That\u0027s so. Now, young chap, shall I kill you or not?\" \"Of course I don\u0027t want to be killed, but you are too strong for me. I am in your power.\" \"Swear, if I spare your life, will you see that I don\u0027t lose by it?\" Gilbert caught his meaning and snatched at the chance of safety. \"If you let me go, you shall have the same amount my uncle promised you, and will have no stain of murder on your hands.\" \"Have you got the money?\" \"Nearly all. The rest I can raise. But I will do better than that, on one condition.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"If you will let me call you as a witness, to prove that my uncle engaged you to kill me, I shall be sure to recover my property, and the day I come into possession I will pay you over two thousand dollars.\" Hugh\u0027s eyes sparkled, but he answered cautiously: \"Won\u0027t there be no risk? Can\u0027t they shut me up?\" \"No; you can say that you entered into the plan in order to entrap my uncle.\" \"Will you swear to do that?\" \"I will.\" \"Then it\u0027s a bargain. Now, what shall we do first?\" \"I want you to go with me to St. Louis, but my uncle must not know that I have escaped. How can we manage that?\" \"We can go up north afterward and take the boat from there. When we pass this place on the river, we\u0027ll stay down below.\" \"That is a good plan. When we get to St. Louis I will see a lawyer at once, and put the matter in his hands.\" \"I don\u0027t like to come before the court,\" said Hugh, reluctantly, \"but I will if you say so.\" \"I don\u0027t think it will be necessary. When my uncle learns that his conspiracy is likely to be made known, he will be glad to compromise without a contest.\" \"You know best. If you\u0027ll come round with me to my hut, I\u0027ll tell the old woman what\u0027s up, and then we\u0027ll strike for the river. You won\u0027t go back on me?\" \"No—that isn\u0027t my way; besides, your testimony is too valuable for me. I\u0027ll stand by you if you\u0027ll stand by me. Give me your hand.\" \"I\u0027ll trust you, young one,\" he said. Before the sun set they were passengers on a river steamer, bound for St. Louis. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83502.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
