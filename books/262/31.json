{"id":7938,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. BUCEPHALUS.","content":"The stable was a handsome building, very complete in its appointments, for both Mr. Grey and Jasper were fond of horses. Opening the small door at one side the boys saw John, the coachman, washing the carriage. \"John, we want the saddle-horses,\" said Jasper. \"Gilbert and I are going to ride.\" \"You will ride your own horse, Mr. Jasper?\" \"Yes.\" \"And your friend will ride Sidney?\" \"No; he will take Bucephalus.\" John shook his head. \"Sidney\u0027s better for him,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u0027t trust Bucephalus.\" \"John, you\u0027re a fool!\" said Jasper, impatiently. \"Gilbert isn\u0027t a baby.\" \"I know he isn\u0027t, Mr. Jasper, but all the same I wouldn\u0027t advise him riding Bucephalus.\" \"What are you afraid of?\" \"He\u0027s a contrary brute, while Sidney\u0027s as good-natured as a kitten.\" \"Oh, well, we\u0027d better have a kitten at once. Gilbert, we\u0027ve got an old cat in the house, warranted safe. If John thinks it more prudent, we\u0027ll saddle her for you. A kitten might be too wild and skittish.\" Gilbert laughed. \"I think I won\u0027t disturb the old cat,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll try Bucephalus.\" \"Better not, sir,\" said the coachman. \"Of course, if you are afraid,\" said Jasper, with another covert sneer, \"you\u0027d better take Sidney; but in that case I shall probably ride away from you.\" \"I\u0027ll take Bucephalus,\" said Gilbert, in decided tones. \"I am not in the least afraid, and I think I can keep up with you.\" \"On that horse I am sure you can.\" John saw that further remonstrance would be unavailing, and very reluctantly got ready the mettlesome steed. Gilbert jumped on his back and put his feet in the stirrups. John came to his side, and said, in a low voice: \"Be very careful, sir. Let him have his way, and don\u0027t chafe or vex him. I hope you won\u0027t have any trouble.\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall. Thank you.\" \"What could possess Mr. Jasper to be so particular to have his friend ride out on the ugly brute?\" thought John, as he watched the two galloping up the road. \"He wouldn\u0027t trust himself on his back. Maybe he won\u0027t mind it so much if the other gets a broken limb or broken neck. I hope there won\u0027t be no accident. That Gilbert, as he calls himself, looks like a nice, gentlemanly lad. I think I\u0027d like him much better than Mr. Jasper, who does put on airs, and orders me round as if I was a dog.\" John watched the two till a turn in the road concealed them from his view, and then went back to his work. But his thoughts could not help dwelling on the rash youth who had placed himself at the mercy of this ill-tempered steed, and he heartily wished he could be sure of his safe return. We will now follow the two riders, and inquire how they sped. Jasper soon found that Gilbert knew how to ride. His position was easy and unconstrained, and his seat was firm. He seemed as much at ease as in a parlor. But then Bucephalus was behaving well. He showed spirit, but was obedient to the rein. \"How do you like Bucephalus?\" inquired Jasper. \"I find no fault with him. He is a fine horse. What made your coachman so afraid of trusting me on him?\" \"I hope you won\u0027t be angry with John,\" answered Jasper, laughing, \"but he doubted whether you could ride. If you didn\u0027t know anything about riding, your horse would soon find it out, and take advantage of it.\" \"Almost any horse would do that.\" \"Of course.\" \"I suppose you have ridden Bucephalus, Jasper?\" \"Certainly, though not often. I am used to my own horse—General, I call him—and I naturally prefer him.\" Jasper did not speak the truth. He had never ridden Bucephalus, nor would he have done so for a considerable sum of money, though he was by no means a poor rider. But Gilbert had no reason, or thought he had not, for doubting his assertion, and readily believed that it was only the coachman\u0027s doubt of his horsemanship that had given rise to the fears he expressed. \"How long has your father owned Bucephalus?\" inquired Gilbert. \"Only three months.\" \"Who rides him?\" \"Neither of us, much. The fact is, Sidney is father\u0027s horse, and this is mine. We don\u0027t need Bucephalus, but father took him for a debt, and means to sell him when he has a good opportunity.\" This was true. Bucephalus had been taken for a debt, and as, on account of his ill-temper, he was of no use to Mr. Grey, he proposed to dispose of him at the first favorable opportunity. \"You ride well,\" said Jasper, after a pause. \"Have you ridden much?\" \"Considerably,\" answered Gilbert, modestly. Had he not been so modest he might have added that his teacher had pronounced him the best rider he had ever taught. But Gilbert was no boaster, and, therefore, Jasper remained in ignorance of his really superior horsemanship. \"You don\u0027t seem to find any trouble in managing him. I wish John could see you ride. He would see how foolish he was in being afraid for you.\" Gilbert was only human, and the compliment pleased him. He knew he was a good rider, and though he was not willing to boast of it, he liked to have it appreciated by others. He could not read the unspoken thought that was passing through his cousin\u0027s mind. \"He does well enough now,\" thought Jasper; \"but wait till Bucephalus wakes up. Then he will be like a child in his grasp. I wouldn\u0027t like to be in his shoes then.\" Yet to this danger from which he himself shrank in dread he had exposed his cousin, when he could easily have saved him from it. It was proof of his cold and selfish wickedness that he could do this without being visited by reproaches of conscience. For several miles Bucephalus behaved unusually well. But at length he began to show signs of the insubordinate spirit that possessed him. They came to a turn in the road; Jasper took the turn, but Bucephalus preferred to go straight on. He shook his head viciously, and snorted defiantly. \"It\u0027s coming,\" thought Jasper, and for the first time he did feel a little pity for his companion. \"Won\u0027t he turn?\" he asked. \"He don\u0027t want to, but he will,\" said Gilbert, coolly. He pulled the right rein in a firm, decided way. Bucephalus reared, and began to dance round. \"Is that your game?\" said Gilbert. \"We\u0027ll see who will be master.\" A man, sitting on a rearing horse, talking to another man astride another horse. \"Is that your game?\" said Gilbert. \"We\u0027ll see who will be master.\"—Page 221. He sawed away at the horse\u0027s mouth with no mercy. Bucephalus was enraged. He could hardly understand the presumption of the rider, who was daring enough to defy him to his worst. He was accustomed to inspire fear in his rider, and his spirit was up. He indulged in worse antics, when he was astonished and maddened by a terrible lashing from the whip in Gilbert\u0027s hand. He started off like a shot at a break-neck speed down the road which Gilbert wanted him to take. In his fury he was not probably aware that he had yielded that point to his master. On he rushed with the speed of lightning. Terror-struck, Jasper, sitting still on his own horse, followed him with his glance. He saw Gilbert, immovable as a rock, keeping his seat on the maddened steed, never for a moment losing courage or self-possession. He was astonished, but he could not help feeling admiration also. \"He rides magnificently,\" he said to himself. \"Who would have supposed that he could manage that brute?\" But there was one thing that Jasper did not know—which I have not yet imparted to the reader. Gilbert had taken lessons of Rarey, the famous horse-tamer, and that gave him a wonderful advantage. Feeling firm in his seat, he let Bucephalus continue his break-neck speed till his beating sides and labored breath showed that he was exhausted. Then turning him unresisting he rode back. After a while he met Jasper. The latter could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the fierce steed cowed and subdued, while his cousin seemed perfectly cool and composed. \"Thank Heaven, you are safe!\" ejaculated Jasper, hypocritically. \"I was very much alarmed about you.\" \"I have given Bucephalus a lesson,\" said Gilbert, quietly. \"I will ride him again to-morrow. I think he is thoroughly subdued now. Did he ever act in this way when you rode him?\" \"No,\" answered Jasper. \"I don\u0027t see what got into him to-day. You rode him splendidly,\" he felt forced to add. \"I am not afraid of horses,\" said Gilbert, quietly. \"But suppose we turn back. I think he has had enough for one day.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83497.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
