{"id":7915,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. THE EFFECT OF A NEW SUIT.","content":"Tom bent his steps in the direction of a large and popular clothing establishment, and, entering, looked about for an unoccupied salesman. \"Well, boy, what\u0027s wanted?\" asked a young man behind the counter. \"I want some clo\u0027es.\" \"Then you\u0027ve come to the right place. Did you buy them you have on here?\" asked the salesman, with a grin. \"Young feller,\" said Tom, \"these clo\u0027es were bought before you were born.\" \"So I should think, from the looks.\" \"I\u0027d make \u0027em do for a few years longer, only I\u0027m goin\u0027 to be married next week. Have you got any bridal suits?\" \"Step this way. I suppose you have got money to pay for them?\" remarked the clerk, doubtfully. \"You suppose right. Just lead the way, and I\u0027ll see what you\u0027ve got.\" \"How high are you willing to go?\" \"Anywhere from twenty-five cents to twenty-five dollars.\" \"Our twenty-five cent suits are all out; but we can give you some for fifteen dollars, and as much more as you like.\" \"Show me some at fifteen.\" Tom looked at some suits at this price. They were well made, but coarse, and did not quite come up to his ideas of what was appropriate for a young man of fortune. \"Show me some for twenty-five dollars,\" he said. \"These ain\u0027t good enough to be married in.\" Finally, Tom picked out a dark mixed suit, which appeared to be an exact fit. The price was twenty dollars, which he considered reasonable, and at once paid. \"Shall I send them home for you?\" asked the clerk, regarding our hero with more respect, now that he had shown himself a purchaser for cash. \"Never mind; I\u0027ll take \u0027em myself,\" said Tom. \"My carriage is waitin\u0027 outside, so it\u0027s no trouble.\" He left the store with the clothes under his arm. But he was not yet wholly provided. He had no shirts, stockings, or under-clothes, which he cared to wear in the new life upon which he was entering. All must be procured. He stopped at a cheap store in Nassau street, and provided himself with half a dozen of each, at a cost of twenty dollars more. By this time he found himself so encumbered with bundles that he thought it best to go home. He entered the room without attracting attention, and proceeded at once to throw off his old rags, and array himself in the new clothes, including a blue silk neck-tie which he had purchased. When his toilet was complete, he surveyed himself with no little complacency. For the first time in all the years that he could remember, he was attired, from top to toe, as a young gentleman. \"Blest if I couldn\u0027t pass myself off for a young Fifth avenoodle,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll go down and see Mrs. Flanagan. I wonder if she\u0027ll know me?\" He descended the stairs, and knocked at the door of the good-hearted Irishwoman. She did not recognize him, having no idea that it was Tom the bootblack. \"Does Mrs. Flanagan live here?\" asked Tom, slightly disguising his voice. \"Yes, sir. Is it washing ye want me to do?\" \"Is there a boy named Tom lives here?\" asked our hero. \"He lives up stairs, just over this.\" \"Do you know him?\" \"Shure I do. I know him as if he was my own bye.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Tom, in his natural voice, raising his hat, which he had worn slouched down over his eyes. \"You didn\u0027t seem to know him when you saw him.\" \"Shure it\u0027s Tom himself!\" exclaimed Mrs. Flanagan. \"Why, Tom, dear, what\u0027s come to you? You\u0027re lookin\u0027 quite the gintleman.\" \"Of course I am,\" said Tom. \"That\u0027s the new business I\u0027ve gone into.\" \"Where did you get them new clo\u0027es, Tom?\" \"I bought them with the money old Jacob left me. And now, Mrs. Flanagan, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to leave you.\" \"Where are you goin\u0027, Tom?\" \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out West, to seek my fortune.\" \"Shure I hope you\u0027ll find it.\" \"So do I, Mrs. Flanagan. I know it\u0027s there, and mean to get it, if I can.\" \"Are you goin\u0027 now?\" \"Not till to-morrow. I\u0027ve got some more things to buy first.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to lose you, Tom. I\u0027ll miss you and old Jacob. I hope the poor man\u0027s better off.\" \"So do I, Mrs. Flanagan. I won\u0027t hide it from you—but he left me a paper, tellin\u0027 me that there is a man out West that\u0027s cheated me out of my fortune.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Grey. He\u0027s my father\u0027s cousin.\" \"Where does he live?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Then how will you find him?\" \"I know how he looks. He was in New York a little while ago, and I blacked his boots. When I come into my fortune, I\u0027ll make you a handsome present, Mrs. Flanagan.\" \"Shure I hope you\u0027ll get it widout the present.\" \"Now I must be goin\u0027. I\u0027ve got to buy a carpet-bag and umbrella.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83474.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
