HOW GILBERT IS DISPOSED OF.","content":"\"What do you want, fellow?\" demanded James Grey, sternly, in order to keep up appearances, for he recognized his confederate. \"Let go that bridle.\" \"I want money,\" said Hugh Trimble, for, of course it was he. \"Is this the fashion in which you ask it?\" said Mr. Grey. \"Let go my bridle, and come round to my house. Then I will listen to your application, and, if I find you deserving, I will grant your request.\" \"That don\u0027t go down,\" said Hugh, roughly. \"You rich men take good care of your money. I shouldn\u0027t stand no chance at your house.\" \"As much there as here.\" \"Maybe not,\" said the man, significantly. \"There you\u0027d be master. Here, I am master.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" \"I mean that I want five hundred dollars, and I mean to have it.\" \"Do you dare to threaten me?\" \"Yes, I do. You are a rich man—I am poor. You can spare five hundred dollars without feeling it.\" \"I don\u0027t intend to be forced into giving you money. Let go that bridle, or I will run over you.\" \"I will stand by you, Mr. Grey,\" said Gilbert, speaking for the first time. \"Don\u0027t submit to that man\u0027s demands.\" \"Young man,\" said Hugh, \"you\u0027d better not interfere. You can\u0027t help your father.\" \"He is not my father.\" \"No matter what he is, you\u0027d better keep out of the affair. That\u0027s the advice I give you.\" \"I shall stand by him,\" said Gilbert, spiritedly. \"You\u0027ve got two against you.\" \"And you\u0027ve got two against you,\" said Hugh, drawing a pistol from a side-pocket. \"What do you say to that?\" \"My friend, what is it that you demand?\" asked Mr. Grey. \"So I\u0027m your friend now, am I?\" retorted Hugh, with a mocking laugh. \"It\u0027s the pistol that\u0027s done it, I reckon.\" \"I repeat it—what do you want?\" \"Five hundred dollars.\" \"I left my pocket-book at home. I will go back and get the money.\" \"Do you take me for a fool? You would come back with an officer of the law.\" \"I promise you that I will lay no trap for you.\" Here Hugh seemed to hesitate. \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do,\" he said, finally. \"Leave the boy with me as a pledge, and I\u0027ll let you go.\" \"Suppose I don\u0027t?\" \"I\u0027ll shoot you on the spot!\" James Grey turned to Gilbert. \"You hear what he says? Are you willing to remain with him while I go back and get the money?\" Gilbert did not fancy the plan, and hesitated. \"If there is no other way,\" he said, at length. \"My friend,\" said Mr. Grey, \"I will stay with you, and send the boy home.\" \"I won\u0027t trust him,\" said Hugh, who had learned his lesson well. \"Besides, he cannot get the money as well as you.\" \"There seems no help for it, Gilbert,\" said James Grey, turning to his nephew. \"He insists upon retaining you, but it shall not be for long. I will at once obtain the money, and come back and release you. He is armed, and we are not. We cannot resist him.\" \"If you think it best,\" said Gilbert. \"I am afraid there is no other way. My friend, suppose I give you my promise to come back, will you excuse this young man from stopping?\" \"No!\" said Hugh, shortly. \"Say no more,\" said Gilbert. \"I will remain.\" He jumped lightly from the chaise, and Hugh released his hold of the bridle. \"When shall you be back?\" he asked. \"At three o\u0027clock this afternoon.\" \"I will be on hand with the boy.\" \"Keep up your courage, Gilbert,\" said Mr. Grey, as he drove away. Out of sight, a smile of triumph overspread his face. \"I didn\u0027t think Hugh would do his part so well,\" he soliloquized. \"Really he is quite an actor. So I am rid of my troublesome responsibility at last. I hope never again to set eyes upon him.\" On reaching home he stated that Gilbert had suddenly received a telegram summoning him to St. Louis; that he had carried him to a landing-place for the river boats, and agreed to dispatch his luggage to the Planters\u0027 House in that city by express. To keep up appearances he did so dispose of Gilbert\u0027s carpet-bag, directing it to \"Gilbert Grey, Planters\u0027 House, St. Louis, Mo.\" \"\u0027Pears like he left mighty suddint,\" said Pompey. \"Yes; he has a friend very sick in St. Louis,\" explained Mr. Grey. \"I\u0027m sorry he\u0027s gone,\" said John, who suspected nothing. \"He was a right fine lad, and he managed Bucephalus beautiful.\" Jasper said nothing, but wondered whether Gilbert had suffered violence at his father\u0027s hands.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83501.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
