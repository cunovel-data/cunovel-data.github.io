{"id":7920,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. AN ADVENTURE.","content":"The next morning, at the time appointed, Tom called at the establishment of Mr. Ferguson. The first he met was Maurice Walton. Maurice, in fact, was the youngest clerk, having received the appointment six weeks before, through the influence of his uncle. \"Did you come round to see me? I\u0027m busy,\" said Maurice. \"Haven\u0027t you swept out yet?\" asked Tom, mischievously. \"Do you think I would demean myself by sweeping out?\" returned Maurice, disgusted. \"I thought that might be your business.\" \"That would be good business for you. Perhaps Mr. Ferguson will engage you.\" \"All right; I\u0027ll accept, if he\u0027ll pay me enough. Is he in?\" \"Who?\" \"Your boss.\" \"I don\u0027t understand such low terms,\" said Maurice, loftily. \"Then it\u0027s time you did. Is Mr. Ferguson in?—if you can understand that better.\" \"Yes, he is, but he won\u0027t see you.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because his time is too valuable.\" \"Then I wonder why he asked me to come round this morning?\" \"Did he?\" \"Of course he did; and, if you\u0027ve got through sweeping out, you\u0027d better let him know I\u0027m on hand.\" \"Go yourself.\" \"Thank you for your polite invitation. They didn\u0027t examine you in good manners when they took you in here, did they?\" \"You\u0027re an impertinent fellow.\" \"Thank you. You ought to be a good judge of impudence. I\u0027ll see you again soon—hope you won\u0027t miss me much.\" Our hero, who, it must be confessed, was not troubled by bashfulness, made a low bow to his opponent, and, advancing to the counting-room, opened the door. Mr. Ferguson looked up from his letters. \"Take a seat, Grey,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ll speak to you in a moment.\" \"Thank you,\" said Tom, who knew how to be polite when it was proper to be so. At the end of fifteen minutes Mr. Ferguson looked up. \"Well,\" said he, \"have you formed any plans, Gilbert?—I think that is your name.\" \"No, sir, except that I\u0027m goin\u0027 to try to get a place.\" \"Have you tried yet?\" \"I called to see a man who offered a light, genteel employment to a young man with a small capital. I thought mine was small enough, so I applied.\" \"Well, what came of it?\" \"The man wasn\u0027t willin\u0027 to sell out for fifteen dollars, so I left.\" \"You seem to be a smart boy. Suppose I take you into my employment?\" \"I\u0027d try to do my duty.\" \"I really don\u0027t need an extra clerk; but you are the son of my old employer, and to him I feel under considerable obligations. I\u0027ll take you on trial.\" \"Thank you, sir. When shall I come?\" \"Next Monday.\" \"All right, sir; I\u0027ll be on hand.\" \"Where are you boarding?\" \"At the Ohio Hotel.\" \"How much board do you pay?\" \"Ten dollars a week.\" \"That is too much. You ought to get board in a private house for four. Between now and Monday, I advise you to look up some decent house that will answer your purpose. You can\u0027t expect to live luxuriously at first.\" \"I ain\u0027t used to first-class accommodations,\" said Tom. \"I see you are a sensible boy. Cut your coat according to your cloth. That is a good maxim. When you get older, you can live better. Now, about your salary. I can\u0027t give much at first, or my other clerks might complain. I will give you five dollars, the same that I pay to my youngest clerk.\" \"Maurice Walton?\" \"Do you know him?\" questioned Mr. Ferguson, in surprise. \"Yes, sir. I took supper at his uncle\u0027s Wednesday evening.\" \"Indeed! I did not know you were acquainted with Mr. Benton.\" \"Bessie Benton came on from Buffalo in my charge.\" \"Really, Gilbert, you seem to be getting on fast. You seem quite able to push your own way.\" \"I\u0027ve always done it, sir.\" \"You are not bashful.\" \"New York street-boys ain\u0027t troubled that way.\" \"That\u0027s well, if not carried too far. Now, tell me how much you know.\" \"If it\u0027s about learning, I can do that in five minutes.\" \"Your education, I take it, has been neglected.\" \"I don\u0027t know much—I didn\u0027t have a chance to learn.\" \"Can you read?\" \"When the words ain\u0027t too long.\" \"And write?\" \"Not much.\" \"Then I advise you to take what leisure time you have to remedy the defects in your education.\" \"I\u0027d like to, sir. I was ashamed of knowing so little when I was at Mr. Benton\u0027s.\" \"A good feeling, my boy. The more you know the better chance you stand to get on in the world. I am giving you a low place in my employment. If you want to be promoted, you must qualify yourself for it.\" \"I\u0027ll do it, sir,\" said our hero, manfully. \"That\u0027s good advice, and I\u0027ll foller it.\" \"Success to you, my boy. You can now go, and come back Monday morning.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Tom left the counting-room in excellent spirits. He had found a place, and one just such as he liked. Five dollars a week, he foresaw, would not pay his expenses, but he was sure he could earn more in some way. As he was about to leave the store, Maurice, whose curiosity was aroused, came to meet him. \"Did you get through your important business?\" he said, sneeringly. \"Not quite. I\u0027m coming here again next Monday.\" \"Mr. Ferguson must be glad to see you.\" \"I\u0027m comin\u0027 Tuesday, also.\" \"What, every day?\" \"Yes; your boss has concluded to take me into the business.\" \"You ain\u0027t coming here to work?\" said Maurice, hastily. \"You\u0027ve hit the nail on the head.\" \"We\u0027ve got enough clerks now.\" \"I\u0027m comin\u0027 to help you sweep out in the mornin\u0027.\" Maurice was by no means pleased to hear this. Regarding Tom as his social inferior, he did not like to be placed on a level with him. \"How much pay are you to get?\" he asked. \"Five dollars a week.\" \"The same as I get?\" \"Yes.\" Maurice was disgusted. \"Then I shall ask for higher pay.\" \"Go ahead. I don\u0027t care.\" \"Do you expect to live on your salary?\" \"No, of course not. I\u0027ve got private property.\" \"How much?\" \"Go and ask the man that calls for the taxes.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Why, I\u0027m payin\u0027 ten dollars a week for my board.\" Finally our hero went out, leaving Maurice dissatisfied and annoyed—first that his rival, as he regarded him, had obtained a place in the same establishment with himself, and next that the new-comer was to receive the same salary. He sent in an application, the next day, for increase of pay, but it was dismissed, with the curt response that when he earned more he would get it. Meanwhile Tom bent his steps toward the Ohio river. Of course, my readers know that Cincinnati is on the north bank of the Ohio, and that just across is a town in Kentucky. \"I\u0027d like to see Kentucky,\" said Tom to himself. \"I guess I\u0027ll go across.\" Small river steamers convey passengers across the river for a very small sum. Our hero paid the required fee and went on board. \"It\u0027s some like goin\u0027 across to Jersey,\" he thought. There was the usual variety of passengers—men, women, and children. Tom sat down beside a young man well dressed, but a little strange in his manners. It was evident that he had been drinking too much, and was under the influence of liquor at present. He was perfectly quiet, however, till they were in the middle of the stream, when, all at once, he climbed the railing and threw himself into the turbid waters of the river. A man diving into a river Tom, being an expert swimmer, jumped in after the man without hesitation.—Page 96. The passengers seemed paralyzed by the suddenness of the action. Our hero was the first to recover, and, being an expert swimmer, jumped in after him without hesitation.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83479.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
