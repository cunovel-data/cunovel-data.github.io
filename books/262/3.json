{"id":7910,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. A STREET FIGHT.","content":"Tom, of course, knew nothing of Jacob\u0027s accident. He fancied him safe at home, and was only concerned to make enough money to pay the necessary expenses of both. He felt little anxiety on this score, as he was of an enterprising disposition, and usually got his fair share of business. He stationed himself near the Astor House, and kept an eye on the boots of all who passed, promptly offering his services where they appeared needed. Of course, there were long intervals between his customers, but in the course of two hours he had made fifty cents, which he regarded as doing fairly. Finally a gentleman, rather tall and portly, descended the steps of the Astor House, and bent his steps in Tom\u0027s direction. \"Shine yer boots?\" asked Tom. The gentleman looked down upon the face of the boy, and a sudden expression swept over his own, as if he were surprised or startled. His boots were tolerably clean; but, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, he said: \"Yes.\" Tom was instantly on his knees, first spreading a piece of carpet, about a foot square, to kneel upon, and set to work with energy. \"How long have you been in this line of business, boy?\" asked his customer. \"Four or five years,\" answered Tom. \"Do you like it?\" \"I have to like it,\" said Tom. \"I\u0027ve got to do somethin\u0027 for a livin\u0027. Bread and meat don\u0027t grow on trees.\" \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked the stranger, abruptly. \"Tom.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got but one name?\" \"Tom Grey\u0027s my whole name; but everybody calls me Tom.\" \"Grey? Did you say your name was Grey?\" asked the stranger, in a tone of some excitement. \"Yes,\" said Tom, surprised at the gentleman\u0027s tone. In his surprise he looked up into his customer\u0027s face, and for the first time took notice of it. This was what he saw: a square face, with a heavy lower jaw, grizzled whiskers, and cold, gray eyes. But there was something besides that served to distinguish it from other faces—a scar, of an inch in length, on his right cheek, which, though years old, always looked red under excitement. \"Grey,\" repeated the stranger. \"Is your father living?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Tom. \"If he is, he\u0027s too busy to call round and see me.\" \"You mean that you don\u0027t know anything about your father?\" \"That\u0027s about so,\" said Tom. \"I\u0027m ready to adopt a rich gentleman as a father, if it\u0027s agreeable.\" And he looked up with a smile in the face of his customer. But the latter did not respond to the joke, but looked more and more serious. \"That smile,\" he said to himself. \"He is wonderfully like. Is it possible that this boy can be——\" But here he stopped, and left the sentence unfinished. \"Are you sure your name is Tom?\" asked the stranger. \"Why shouldn\u0027t it be?\" demanded the boy, in natural surprise. \"To be sure,\" returned the gentleman. \"Only I have a theory that there is a connection between faces and names, and you don\u0027t look like my idea of Tom.\" This was rather philosophical to be addressed to a New York bootblack; but Tom was smart enough to comprehend it. \"If I don\u0027t look like Tom, what do I look like?\" he asked. \"John, or Henry, or—or Gilbert,\" said the gentleman, bringing out the last name after a slight pause. \"I like Tom best,\" said the boy; \"it\u0027s short and easy.\" \"Do you live alone, or have you any friends?\" asked the stranger. \"I live with an old man, but he ain\u0027t any relation to me.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" \"Jacob.\" \"What other name?\" asked the customer, quickly. Tom had by this time completed his task, and was standing erect, facing the speaker. \"He\u0027s got an inquirin\u0027 mind,\" thought Tom; but, though rather surprised at the questions, he had no objection to answer them. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t know?\" \"He never told me. Maybe it\u0027s Grey, like mine. Some call him my grandfather, but he isn\u0027t.\" \"It is he,\" thought the stranger; \"but things are well as they are. He knows nothing, and need know nothing. I am safe enough, since between us there is a great gulf of ignorance, and more than a thousand miles of space.\" \"Well, my boy,\" he said, aloud, \"I suppose you want to be paid?\" \"That\u0027s what\u0027s the matter,\" answered Tom. The stranger put in his hand a half dollar, and Tom, plunging his hand in his pocket, prepared to give change. \"Never mind,\" said his late customer, with a wave of his hand. \"Thanks,\" said Tom, and he mentally wished he might be as well paid every day for answering questions. Tom shouldered his box, and walked a few steps down Broadway. It was some time before another customer appeared, and meanwhile another bootblack came up. The name of the newcomer was Pat Walsh. He enjoyed a bad reputation among his comrades—as one who would take a mean advantage, if he dared, and was at all times ready to bully a smaller boy. He had long cherished an ill feeling toward Tom, because the latter had interfered, on one occasion, to protect a smaller boy whom Pat tried to cheat out of a job. As Tom\u0027s prowess was well known, Pat had contented himself hitherto with uttering threats which he hesitated to carry into execution. It was shrewdly suspected by his companions that he was afraid to contend with Tom, and they had taunted him with it. Finding his authority diminishing, Pat decided to force a quarrel upon Tom at the first opportunity. He had no great appetite for the fight, but felt it to be a disagreeable necessity. Just as he came up a gentleman approached with a valise in his hand. His boots were decidedly dirty, and he was hailed as a prize by the bootblacks. \"Shine yer boots?\" exclaimed Tom and Pat, simultaneously. \"I don\u0027t know but they need brushing,\" said the traveler. Instantly both bootblacks were on their knees before him, ready to proceed to business. \"I don\u0027t need both of you,\" he said, smiling. \"Take me,\" said Pat; \"I\u0027ll give you a bully shine.\" \"I\u0027ll give you the bulliest,\" said Tom, good humoredly. \"I spoke first.\" \"Lave wid yer, or I\u0027ll mash yer!\" said Pat. \"Better not try it,\" said Tom, not in the least intimidated. \"The gentleman will choose between us.\" \"I\u0027ll choose you,\" said the traveler, decidedly more prepossessed by Tom\u0027s appearance than by that of his competitor. There was no appeal from this decision, and Pat rose to his feet, his face wearing a very ugly scowl. He remained standing near, while Tom was engaged with his job, watching him with an aspect which betokened mischief. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Tom, as he received pay for his services. The customer had no sooner left the spot than Pat strode up to Tom. \"I want that money,\" he said, menacingly. \"Do you?\" returned Tom, coolly, as he thrust it into his vest pocket, for, unlike the majority of his companions, he indulged in the luxury of a vest. \"Yes, I do. It was my job.\" \"I don\u0027t see it.\" \"I spoke first.\" \"The gentleman chose me.\" \"You stuck yourself in where you wasn\u0027t wanted. Give me the money.\" \"Come and take it,\" said Tom, unconsciously making the same answer that was once returned by a heroic general to an insolent demand for surrender. \"I\u0027ll do it, then,\" said Pat, who had been nursing his rage till he was grown reckless of consequences. He threw down his box and sprang at Tom. The latter also quickly rid himself of the incumbrance, and the two were soon wrestling at close quarters. Pat, by his impetuous onset, came near upsetting his adversary; but, by an effort, Tom saved himself. Then commenced a determined contest. Both boys were unusually strong for their ages, and were, in fact, very evenly matched. But at length Tom, by an adroit movement of the foot, tripped his opponent, and came down on top of him. He did not hold him down, for he was fond of fair play, but rose immediately. \"You didn\u0027t do it; I slipped,\" said Pat, in anger and mortification, and he instantly threw himself upon Tom again. But our hero kept cool, while Pat was excited, and this placed him at an advantage. So the second contest terminated like the first. Cheers from a crowd of boys greeted this second victory—cheers to which Pat listened with mortification and rage. He was half tempted to renew the battle, but a cry from the boys, \"A cop! a cop!\" warned him of the approach of his natural enemy, the policeman, and he walked sullenly away, breathing threats of future vengeance, to which Tom paid very little attention. Five minutes later little Mike Flanagan came up, and pulled Tom by the arm. \"What\u0027s the matter, Mike?\" asked Tom, seeing that the little boy looked excited. \"Your grandfather\u0027s been run over wid a horse,\" said the little boy, not very intelligibly. \"Run over!\" exclaimed Tom. \"How can that be, when he was at home on the bed?\" \"He went out soon after you, and was beggin\u0027 on Broadway.\" \"Where is he now?\" asked Tom, quickly. \"He was took to the hospital,\" said Mike. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83469.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
