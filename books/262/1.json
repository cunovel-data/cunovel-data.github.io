{"id":7908,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. INTRODUCING TOM, THE BOOTBLACK.","content":"\"How do you feel this morning, Jacob?\" asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall. \"Weak, Tom,\" whined the old man, in reply. \"I—I ain\u0027t got much strength.\" \"Would you like some breakfast?\" \"I—I don\u0027t know. Breakfast costs money.\" \"Never you mind about that, Jacob. I can earn money enough for both of us. Come, now, you\u0027d like some coffee and eggs, wouldn\u0027t you?\" There was a look of eager appetite in the old man\u0027s eyes as he heard the boy speak. \"Yes,\" he answered, \"I should like them; but we can\u0027t afford it.\" \"Don\u0027t you be afraid of that. I\u0027ll go and ask Mrs. Flanagan to get some ready at once. I\u0027ve earned thirty cents this morning already, Jacob, and that\u0027ll pay for breakfast for the two of us. I think I could eat some breakfast myself.\" Jacob uttered a feeble remonstrance, but the boy did not stop to hear it. He went down the rough staircase, and knocked at the door of the room below. It was opened by a stout, wholesome-looking Irish woman, who saluted the boy heartily. \"Well, Tom, and how\u0027s your grandfather this mornin\u0027?\" \"He\u0027s weak, Mrs. Flanagan; but he\u0027ll be the better for some breakfast, and so shall I. I\u0027ll go and buy half a dozen eggs, if you\u0027ll be kind enough to cook them, and make some coffee for us. I\u0027ll pay you for your trouble.\" \"Of course I will, Tom. And for the eggs you needn\u0027t go out, for I\u0027ve got the same in the closet; but I\u0027m short of bread, and, if you\u0027ll buy a loaf, I\u0027ll have the coffee and eggs ready in no time.\" While Tom is on his way to the baker\u0027s shop, a few words of explanation and description may be in place. First, for our hero. I have already said he was fifteen. Let me add that he was stout and strongly built, with an open, prepossessing face, and the air of one who is ready to fight his own battles without calling for assistance. His position in life is humble, for he is a street bootblack. He has served, by turns, at other vocations; but he has found none of them pay so well as this. He has energy and enterprise, and few of his comrades secure so many customers as he. For years he has lived with the old man introduced as Jacob, and is popularly regarded as his grandson; but Jacob has never made claim to that relationship, nor has he ever volunteered any information to the boy as to what originally brought them together. Occasionally Tom has tried to obtain some information, but on such occasions Jacob has been very reticent, and has appeared, for some reason, unwilling to speak. So, by degrees, Tom has given up asking questions, and has been much more concerned about the means of living than about his pedigree. Jacob has done little or nothing for their common support, though at times, greatly to the annoyance of Tom, he has gone out on the street and asked alms. Tom, being high-spirited and independent, has resented this, and has always interfered, in a very decided manner, to prevent Jacob\u0027s figuring as a beggar. Though only a bootblack, he has an honest independence of feeling, in which any one is justified who works, however humbly, for his support. Old Jacob is, moreover, a miser, so far as he can be. Whatever money he may have acquired by begging, he has kept. At all events, he has offered nothing of it for the common expenses. But Tom has not troubled himself about this. He suspects that Jacob may have a few dollars secreted somewhere, but is perfectly willing he should keep them for his own satisfaction. His earnings average over a dollar a day, and with this sum he is able to pay the small rent of their humble apartment, and buy their food. In ten minutes Tom reappeared with a loaf under his arm. The door of Mrs. Flanagan\u0027s room was partly open, and he entered without ceremony. The good woman was bustling about preparing the eggs. The coffee-pot was already on the stove. \"It\u0027ll be ready in a minute, Tom,\" she said. \"A cup of hot coffee\u0027ll do the poor craythur, yer grandfather, a power of good. So he\u0027s fable, is he?\" \"Yes, Mrs. Flanagan.\" \"He won\u0027t last long, to my thinkin\u0027.\" \"Do you think he\u0027s going to die?\" asked Tom, thoughtfully. \"Yes, poor craythur. It\u0027s all he can do to drag himself up and down stairs.\" \"I shall be sorry to have him die,\" said Tom, \"though I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s any relation to me.\" \"Isn\u0027t he your grandfather, then?\" asked Mrs. Flanagan, in surprise. \"No; he never said he was.\" \"Then what makes the two of you live together? Maybe he\u0027s your uncle, though he looks too old for that.\" \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s any relation. All I know is, I\u0027ve lived with him ever since I was so high.\" And Tom indicated with his hand the height of a boy of six. \"Then he\u0027s never told you anything?\" \"No. I\u0027ve asked him sometimes, but he didn\u0027t seem to want to speak.\" When Tom re-entered the room he found the old man crouching in the corner, as at first. \"Come, Jacob,\" he said, cheerfully, \"get up; I\u0027ve got some breakfast for you.\" The old man\u0027s features lighted up as he inhaled the grateful odor of the coffee, and he rose with some effort to his feet, and seated himself at the little table on which our hero placed it. \"Now, Jacob,\" said Tom, cheerfully, \"I\u0027ll pour you out a cup of coffee. Mrs. Flanagan made it, and it\u0027s bully. It\u0027ll put new life into you. Then what do you say to a plate of eggs and some roll? I haven\u0027t got any butter, but you can dip it in your coffee. Now, isn\u0027t this a nice breakfast?\" \"Yes, Tom,\" said the old man, surveying the coffee and eggs with eyes of eager desire. \"It\u0027s nice; but we can\u0027t afford to live so all the time.\" \"Never you mind about that; we can afford it this morning; so don\u0027t spoil your appetite with thinkin\u0027 how much it costs.\" \"Now,\" said Tom, after he had helped the old man, \"I don\u0027t mind takin\u0027 something myself. I ain\u0027t troubled with a delicate appetite, \u0027specially when I\u0027ve been up and at work for two hours.\" \"Did you make much, Tom?\" \"Well, I ain\u0027t made my fortune yet. I\u0027ve earned thirty cents, but I\u0027ll make it up to a dollar before noon.\" \"You\u0027re a good boy, Tom,\" said the old man, approvingly. \"Don\u0027t be afraid of work; I\u0027d work, too, if I wasn\u0027t so old. It costs a sight to live, and I don\u0027t earn a cent.\" \"There ain\u0027t no need of it, Jacob; I can earn enough for the two of us. I\u0027m young and strong. You are old and weak. When I\u0027m an old man, like you, I won\u0027t want to work no more.\" \"I ain\u0027t so very old,\" said Jacob, jealously. \"I\u0027m only turned sixty-five. There\u0027s a good many years of life in me yet.\" \"Of course there is, Jacob,\" said Tom, though as he looked at his companion\u0027s thin, wasted face and shaking hand, he felt very doubtful on this point. \"My father lived to be seventy-five,\" said Jacob. \"So will you,\" said Tom, though, to the boy of fifteen, sixty-five appeared a very advanced age, and but little younger than eighty. \"I\u0027ll be stronger soon,\" said Jacob. \"The weather ain\u0027t suited me.\" \"That\u0027s it, Jacob. Now let me give you another cup of coffee. It goes to the right spot, don\u0027t it? Don\u0027t you be afraid; there\u0027s plenty of it.\" So he filled Jacob\u0027s cup once more, and the old man drank the contents with evident relish. \"Now don\u0027t you feel better?\" asked Tom. \"Why, you look ten years younger\u0027n you did before you sat down. There\u0027s nothing like a bully breakfast to make a feller feel tip-top.\" \"Yes, I do feel better,\" said Jacob. \"I—I think you\u0027re right, Tom. If I was rich, I\u0027d always have a good breakfast.\" \"So you shall now, Jacob. It don\u0027t cost much. Now lie down again, and I\u0027ll take these dishes down to Mrs. Flanagan.\" Tom speedily reappeared, and said, cheerfully: \"If there\u0027s nothing more you want, Jacob, I\u0027ll go out and look out for work. Mrs. Flanagan will bring you up some toast at noon, and I\u0027ll be back at six o\u0027clock.\" \"All right, Tom. Go to work, there\u0027s a good boy. It costs a sight of money to live.\" Tom seized his blacking-box and hurried down stairs. He had delayed longer than he intended, and was resolved to make up for lost time. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83467.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
