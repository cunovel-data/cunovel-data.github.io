{"id":7931,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. A SUDDEN DEPARTURE.","content":"After James Grey\u0027s triumphant feeling that he had spiked the guns of his young adversary, the revulsion and disappointment of defeat were all the more disheartening. He would like to have believed his tale a false one, but that was not easy. On a closer inspection of the paper which Maurice Walton had brought to him, he discovered a water-mark in the paper showing that it had only been manufactured the year previous. As Gilbert had been in Cincinnati three years, this, of course, was sufficient to show that the document could not be genuine. \"Who would have imagined the fellow so shrewd?\" ejaculated his uncle, pacing the room with hurried steps. \"He lost no time in locking up the paper. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s going to be a dangerous enemy.\" Then, contemptuously: \"What a fool I am—a full-grown man, with fifty years\u0027 experience of the world, to be afraid of what a boy can do! No, he shall not gain his point. Possession is nine points of the law, and possession is mine. If he undertakes to oust me, he must be careful, for I have not lived in luxury, and grown accustomed to it for years, to resign it quietly now. If it is going to be a fight, it shall be a desperate one.\" One of the smaller mortifications which Mr. Grey experienced was that of paying Maurice Walton a hundred and ten dollars, without receiving any benefit from the outlay. \"I\u0027d get the money back, if I could,\" he thought, but reflection convinced him that this would be impossible. Besides, the best way to secure Maurice\u0027s continued silence, was to leave him in undisturbed possession of the money. \"After all, there\u0027s one good thing about him,\" considered Mr. Grey, \"he hates my rascally nephew. For that alone I make him welcome to the money, though he has done me no good.\" How should he carry on the campaign? That was the first thing to be considered. Evidently his policy was to be passive. He must remain on the defensive, leaving the aggressive part of the conflict to his nephew. First in the programme, he determined to leave Cincinnati at once, so that no legal process might be served upon him. \"Fortunately, the boy does not know where I live, nor can his employer give him any clew, as he, too, is ignorant of it. If he takes the trouble to call upon me again, he will find the bird flown.\" James Grey was a man of quick action. He no sooner came to this determination than he proceeded to carry it out. Proceeding to the clerk\u0027s desk, he announced his immediate departure. Then, taking care not to order a hotel carriage, lest this should afford a clew to his destination, he left the hotel with his carpet-bag in his hand, and took a cab from the next street. He was driven direct to the depot, and, in a few minutes, was on his way westward. \"How lucky it was that I took the paper from my trunk,\" thought Gilbert, as he left the hotel. \"Probably it would, by this time, have been destroyed, had it come into my uncle\u0027s possession. I think I\u0027m a little ahead of him, this time.\" Gilbert was not intimidated, nor were his resolutions shaken by the defiant tone in which his uncle had spoken to him. He was a spirited boy, and he meant to stick to his rights, as he understood them. He was not one to be browbeaten or cheated, and he resolved to fight out the battle. \"I will call on my uncle to-morrow evening,\" he resolved. \"He will then have had twenty-four hours to think over the situation, and, if he is a man of sense, he will see that he can\u0027t get over my proofs.\" When Mr. Ferguson, therefore, asked him how the business progressed, he answered that nothing definite had been settled upon, but that he was to have another interview with his uncle in the evening. \"It will take some time to bring him round, I think,\" said his employer. \"A man doesn\u0027t resign a fine estate without some opposition. If you should need any advice, at any time, you may apply to me freely.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Ferguson, I certainly will. Perhaps I may need to do it to-morrow.\" In the evening our hero walked into the hotel, and, stepping up to the desk, inquired if Mr. Grey was in. \"He has gone away,\" was the answer. \"Gone!\" exclaimed Gilbert, in manifest dismay, for that possibility had not occurred to him. \"Yes—he went away yesterday afternoon.\" \"Do you know where he went? From what depot?\" \"I cannot tell you. He didn\u0027t take a carriage, but walked. Probably he went home.\" \"Will you let me see his name on the register?\" The book was placed before him, and Gilbert, finding the entry of his uncle\u0027s name, saw opposite it, \"St. Louis, Mo.\" \"So he lives in St. Louis,\" thought our hero. \"It won\u0027t be hard to find him, then. His name is probably in the directory. I must go at once to St. Louis. This business ought to be attended to at once.\" Of course, it was necessary to speak to his employer about leave of absence. Probably, also, Mr. Ferguson would be able to give him some valuable advice, and he was likely to stand in need of it, for the undertaking on which he had entered was of no light character. Single-handed, he could hardly hope to overcome so experienced and determined an opponent as James Grey. He sought Mr. Ferguson, and gave him a full account of what had happened thus far. He concluded by stating the departure of his uncle. \"Well, Gilbert,\" said Mr. Ferguson, after he had finished, \"have you thought of anything further, or will you let the matter rest?\" \"Never!\" exclaimed our hero, with energy. \"I will not rest till I have recovered the property of which my uncle has deprived me.\" \"That will be difficult.\" \"I know it, but I am not afraid of difficulty. It is not impossible. He thrust me into the streets of New York to earn my living as a bootblack; and I might have been there now, if Jacob had not revealed to me the story of my birth.\" \"You don\u0027t express yourself much like a street-boy now, Gilbert.\" \"No, sir. I hope I have improved since then.\" \"I used to be amused, sometimes, by the expressions you used.\" \"I don\u0027t wonder, sir. I must have talked like a young barbarian; but I am grateful to God for having raised me above my former ignorance.\" \"It is determined, then, that you will prosecute your claims. How do you propose to do it?\" \"I must first go to St. Louis and see my uncle again.\" \"Does he live in St. Louis?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How do you know? Did he tell you so?\" \"No, sir. But I read it on the hotel register, at the hotel.\" \"Did he register himself before he first met you?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Where was he before?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" \"Then what reason have you to think that he registered correctly? Why did he change his hotel? I may be wrong, but it strikes me that it was intended as a blind to deceive you. Your uncle is a shrewd man, and he would understand the importance of keeping his real residence concealed from one who had in his power to prosecute a claim against him involving nearly his whole fortune.\" \"Then you don\u0027t think he lives in St. Louis, Mr. Ferguson?\" \"I don\u0027t think he does.\" Gilbert looked blank. \"That interferes with my plans,\" he said. \"I meant to ask a month\u0027s leave of absence from you, and go to St. Louis and see what I could do.\" \"That would take money.\" \"I have saved up about eight hundred dollars,\" said Gilbert. \"Eight hundred dollars?\" repeated his employer, surprised. \"How was it possible for you to save so much?\" \"I have no board to pay. My roommate is rich, and I was the means of doing him a service which he repays in that way.\" \"I congratulate you, Gilbert. It speaks well for your habits that you have laid aside so much money. I was about to offer you a loan.\" \"Thank you very much, Mr. Ferguson,\" said Gilbert, gratefully; \"but I don\u0027t think I shall need it. I shall have money enough, but that is not all. From what you say, I am afraid, if I went to St. Louis, it would only be a wild-goose chase.\" \"Stay,\" said Mr. Ferguson, after a moment\u0027s thought; \"an idea strikes me. You may gain the knowledge you want with very little trouble. Mind, I say may. It is not certain.\" \"How, sir?\" said Gilbert, eagerly.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83490.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
