{"id":7923,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. MAURICE IS ASTONISHED.","content":"Maurice Walton felt very much annoyed at the prospect of having Tom for a fellow-clerk. He felt jealous of him on account of the evident partiality of Bessie Benton for his society. He suspected, from Tom\u0027s style of talking, that he was \"low and uneducated,\" and he would have given considerable to know that his hated rival had been a New York bootblack. But this knowledge he could not obtain from Tom. The latter delighted in mystifying him, and exciting suspicions which he afterward learned to be groundless. Bright and early Tom made his appearance in front of Mr. Ferguson\u0027s establishment. As he came up one way, he met Maurice, looking sleepy and cross, coming from a different direction. \"Good-morning, Maurice,\" said our hero, good-naturedly. \"Have you just got out of bed?\" \"No,\" answered Maurice, crossly. \"My name is Walton.\" \"How are you, Walton?\" \"Mr. Walton, if you please,\" said Maurice, with dignity. \"Don\u0027t we feel big this morning, Mr. Walton?\" said Tom, mischievously. \"Do you mean to insult me?\" \"Wouldn\u0027t think of such a thing, Mr. Walton. My name is Mr. Grey.\" Maurice didn\u0027t think proper to answer this remark—perhaps because he had nothing in particular to say. He opened the warehouse, and Tom entered. \"I don\u0027t know what made Mr. Ferguson take you,\" he said, amiably. \"Nor I,\" said Tom; \"particularly as he had your valuable services.\" \"Very likely he took you out of charity,\" said Maurice. \"Did he take you out of charity?\" asked Tom, innocently—\"Mr. Walton?\" \"How dare you speak of me in that way?\" demanded Maurice, haughtily. \"It didn\u0027t take much courage,\" said Tom, coolly. \"How dared you speak of me in that way?\" \"That\u0027s different.\" \"Why is it?\" \"You haven\u0027t got much money—you\u0027re almost a beggar.\" \"Where did you find out all that?\" \"Anybody can tell by just looking at you.\" \"That\u0027s the way, then? Have you got much money?\" \"My uncle has.\" \"So has my uncle.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"That don\u0027t alter the fact.\" \"How much is he worth?\" \"Over a hundred thousand dollars—I don\u0027t know how much more.\" \"Where does he live.\" \"He used to live in this city, but he\u0027s gone farther West.\" Maurice was not decided whether to believe this statement or not. He wanted to disbelieve it, but was afraid it might be true. He tried a different tack. \"Where do you board? Are you at the Ohio Hotel? I hear it\u0027s a low place—third-class.\" \"You\u0027re about right. It isn\u0027t first-class.\" \"I suppose you had to go there because it was cheap?\" \"It was the first hotel I came across. But I\u0027m not there now—I\u0027ve moved.\" \"Have you? Where are you now?\" \"No. 12 Crescent Place.\" Now Maurice knew that Crescent Place was in a fashionable quarter of the city. It astonished him that our hero, whose salary was but five dollars a week, should live in such a neighborhood. \"Twelve Crescent Place?\" he repeated. \"How much board do you pay?\" \"That\u0027s a secret between me and the landlady,\" said Tom. \"If you\u0027ll come round and see me this evening, you can judge for yourself.\" Having a strong curiosity about Tom\u0027s circumstances, Maurice accepted the invitation. \"Perhaps there are two Crescent Places,\" he thought. \"I don\u0027t believe he can afford to live in a fashionable boarding-house.\" \"Mr. Mordaunt,\" said Tom, when they were getting ready for supper, \"I\u0027ve invited a friend to call this evening.\" \"That\u0027s right. I shall be glad to see him.\" \"It\u0027s that boy that loves me so much, Maurice Walton. He\u0027s awfully jealous of me—tries to snub me all the time.\" \"Then why did you invite such a fellow to call?\" \"Because he thinks I live in a poor place, and it will make him mad to find me in such a nice room.\" \"I see,\" said Mordaunt, laughing. \"It isn\u0027t as a friend you invite him.\" \"I\u0027m as much his friend as he is mine.\" \"What makes him dislike you.\" \"I don\u0027t know, except because Bessie Benton is polite to me, and seems to like my company.\" Mordaunt laughed. \"That explains it fully,\" he said. \"So you are rivals for the young lady\u0027s hand?\" \"Not quite. I ain\u0027t quite ready to be married yet. I\u0027ll wait awhile. But Bessie\u0027s a tip-top girl.\" \"You must introduce me some time.\" \"All right. I\u0027ll try and get an invitation for you to call with me.\" About eight o\u0027clock Maurice reached Crescent Place, and, scanning the numbers, found No. 12. \"He can\u0027t live in such a house,\" thought he. \"It\u0027s ridiculous.\" Still, he rang the bell, and, when the servant appeared, he asked, rather hesitatingly: \"Does Gilbert Grey live here?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said the servant. \"Will you go up to his room?\" \"I don\u0027t know where his room is. Will you ask him to come down?\" \"There is somebody to see you, Mr. Grey,\" said the servant, after mounting the stairs. \"He\u0027s come,\" said our hero, in a low voice, to Mordaunt. \"I\u0027ll go down and bring him up.\" Tom descended the stairs and welcomed Maurice. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re come, Mr. Walton,\" he said. \"Come up stairs to my room.\" Finding that he did, after all, live in this handsome house, Maurice expected that it was on the upper floor, and was surprised when Tom led the way into a handsome parlor on the second floor. \"My roommate, Mr. Mordaunt, Mr. Walton,\" said Tom, introducing the visitor. \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Walton,\" said Mordaunt. \"Take a seat,\" and he indicated a luxurious armchair. Maurice sank into its depths, and looked around him with wonder. How in the world could a fellow like Tom, earning a salary of five dollars a week, afford to board so luxuriously? Why, it quite eclipsed even his uncle\u0027s rooms. Handsome pictures, books, statuary, and choice furniture, under the brilliant blaze of an argand burner, made a beautiful apartment. \"You\u0027ve got a nice room,\" he could not help saying. \"Won\u0027t you look at the bedroom?\" said Mordaunt, politely. Maurice looked in, and found it in proportion to the parlor. \"Gilbert and I manage to make ourselves comfortable,\" said Mordaunt. \"We enjoy it ourselves, and are glad to have a pleasant place to invite our friends to.\" Maurice was astonished; but such is the influence of wealth, or apparent wealth, upon a disposition like his, that he thawed, and made up his mind that he had better change his manner toward one who was able to afford living in such a style. \"He must have money,\" he thought. \"Perhaps it\u0027s his rich uncle. I thought he was lying, but I guess it\u0027s true, after all.\" Tom saw the change in his manner, and it amused him. \"He thinks I\u0027m somebody, after all,\" he said to himself. \"What would he say if he knowed what I used to be?—how I went round the streets of New York calling out: \u0027Shine yer boots!\u0027 and was glad if I could earn a dollar a day that way? I don\u0027t believe Mordaunt would mind. I\u0027m going to tell him some time, and see.\" \"Do you ever play checkers, Mr. Walton?\" asked Mordaunt. \"Sometimes.\" \"Then suppose we try a game, or perhaps you will play with him, Gilbert?\" \"I\u0027d rather look on,\" said Tom. \"I don\u0027t know how to play, but maybe I\u0027ll learn lookin\u0027 at you.\" \"Very well.\" Two games were played, and then a waiter appeared from a neighboring restaurant with some cake and ice-cream, of which Maurice partook with evident enjoyment. His ideas with regard to our hero were quite revolutionized. He was a good fellow, after all. So when he took leave, at the close of the evening, he readily promised to come again, and did not forget to do so. \"He\u0027ll take more notice of me now,\" said Tom, laughing. \"He\u0027ll think I\u0027m somebody.\" \"It\u0027s the way of the world, Gilbert,\" said Mordaunt. \"We must take it as it comes.\" \"Maybe,\" said Tom, looking at his companion earnestly, \"you wouldn\u0027t like to have me room with you if you knew what I used to be.\" \"What did you used to be?\" asked Mordaunt, not without curiosity. \"A New York bootblack.\" \"Is it possible?\" \"Don\u0027t you want me to go?\" \"No, Gilbert; my friendship is too strong for that. But I want to hear about your former life. Sit down and tell me all about it.\" Mordaunt listened with interest and surprise to the story of his roommate. \"It seems,\" he said, in conclusion, \"that there is a fortune somewhere to which you are entitled.\" \"Yes,\" said our hero, \"but my uncle will take pretty good care that I don\u0027t get it.\" \"From your description he doesn\u0027t seem to be a credit to the family. What are you going to do about it? Have you any plan?\" \"Mr. Ferguson advises me to stay here for the present. He says I am as likely to hear of my uncle, if I stay in Cincinnati, as if I travel round the country after him.\" \"I presume he is right. As your uncle was formerly in business here, he is likely to come here some time on a visit. If he does, he will be likely to call at your establishment. The best thing you can do is to attend to your business, learn as much as possible, and keep your eyes open.\" \"I guess you\u0027re right,\" said Tom. \"I ain\u0027t very old yet. I\u0027ll try to learn something, so that, when I come into my fortune, I can appear like a gentleman.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83482.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
