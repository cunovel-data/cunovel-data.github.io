{"id":7939,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. AN UNWELCOME RETURN.","content":"\"I wish I know\u0027d the boy would come to no harm,\" thought John, the coachman. \"What made Master Jasper so anxious to have him ride the ugly brute? He wouldn\u0027t trust his own neck, but maybe it makes a difference when another\u0027s is in danger. I ain\u0027t sure but I\u0027d rather my frind, Pat Murphy, would break his neck than mysilf. It\u0027s human natur to think of your silf first, and Master Jasper is got his shere of human natur\u0027 I\u0027m thinkin\u0027!\" Time passed, and still John, as he kept about his work, could not keep his thoughts off the adventurous youth who had ridden Bucephalus. From time to time he went outside the stable, and shading his eyes with his hand, looked up the road, but still nothing was to be seen of either of the boys. \"If he can manage the ugly baste, he knows how to ride, that\u0027s sure,\" said John to himself. \"I wish I was certain of that same, I do, by St. Patrick.\" \"What are you looking at, John?\" asked a voice, near at hand. John turned suddenly, and perceived that it was Mr. Grey who spoke. \"I was lookin\u0027 to see if the boys was comin\u0027 back,\" said John. \"They\u0027ll come back in due time. You needn\u0027t leave off your work for that.\" \"I wish I knowed that, sir.\" \"Knowed what?\" repeated his employer. \"That the young man—Mr. Gilbert—would come back safe.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t he come back?\" inquired James Grey. \"He rode on Bucephalus, sir.\" \"Suppose he did?\" \"I\u0027m afraid the ugly baste will do him some harm.\" \"I am not afraid. Bucephalus is a spirited horse, I am aware, but he is used to riding, and doubtless can manage him.\" \"So is Mr. Jasper used to riding, but you couldn\u0027t hire him to ride Bucephalus.\" \"He has a horse of his own,\" said Mr. Grey, impatiently, not liking John\u0027s pertinacity. \"Of course he prefers to ride on his own horse.\" \"Would you ride him yourself, sir?\" asked John, shrewdly. \"I have had enough of this,\" said Mr. Grey, sternly. \"It is a good rule, John, to mind your own business, and I am forced to remind you of it. Go into the stable, and continue your work. I did not know Gilbert was going to ride Bucephalus, but as he has chosen to do it, I do not feel in the least anxious. I have no doubt he will come back safe.\" \"There he comes, begorra,\" exclaimed John, suddenly, swinging his hat in joyous excitement, \"alive and kickin\u0027, sure, and the ugly brute as make and quiet as a lamb, too.\" \"Where?\" asked Mr. Grey, sharing John\u0027s excitement, but feeling a wicked disappointment in the failure of his evil plans. \"Don\u0027t you see him, sir? He\u0027s jist at the turnin\u0027. Shure he looks like he had mastered the horse, as bowld as a hero.\" It was as John had said. Side by side at a walk came the two horses with their riders. The fierce steed had found his master, and looked quiet and subdued. Never till that day had he been broken. Till this time he had felt his power, now he felt the power of another. Gilbert seemed perfectly at home on his back, and from his manner no one would have supposed that he had had a hard conflict with the brute, from which, had he not come forth victorious, the result might have been death or serious injury. \"He\u0027s dangerous,\" thought his uncle. \"A boy who can subdue such a horse must have an unconquerable will. While he lives, I am not safe.\" To John he said, wishing to keep up appearances: \"I told you he would come back safe. You only made a fool of yourself by worrying.\" \"Shure he must be a splindid rider, sir,\" said John, perplexed, \"or else he has the divil\u0027s own luck, the one or the other.\" Mr. Grey waited till the boys came up, and John took the liberty of doing the same, though he had been bidden to go back to his work. \"How did you enjoy your ride?\" he inquired, looking to Gilbert. \"I see you rode Bucephalus.\" \"I had a little fight with the horse,\" answered Gilbert, \"but I came off best.\" \"So he undertook to trouble you, did he?\" asked Mr. Grey, with curiosity. \"Yes. He thought he was master, and undertook first to disobey, and afterward to run away with me. But I think he met his match, didn\u0027t you, Bucephalus?\" said Gilbert, with a laugh, as he stroked the horse\u0027s neck. Bucephalus showed signs of pleasure, and the fierce glance of his eye was softer and more gentle than Mr. Grey had ever known it. \"Shure and I\u0027m glad you come back safe, Mr. Gilbert,\" said John, earnestly. \"I don\u0027t see how you did it.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll find him so troublesome after this, John,\" said our hero, dismounting. \"We are better friends than we were—eh, Bucephalus?\" \"Ye must have had a charm,\" said John, more than half in earnest. \"I never saw such a change in a creetur before. He was a lion when he went out, and he comes back a lamb.\" \"It\u0027s a great secret,\" said Gilbert, laughing. \"Will it last, do you think?\" \"I think so. When a horse is once conquered he remembers it.\" \"Shure, thin, he\u0027s worth twice the sum he was before,\" said John. \"Do you want me to charge Mr. Grey for my services?\" asked Gilbert, laughing. \"Shure he could afford to pay you,\" answered John, \"and that handsome.\" \"How far did you go, Jasper?\" inquired his father. \"About eight miles, sir.\" \"Well, you must be tired and hungry. Come into the house, and the cook shall send you up some lunch.\" \"I am not in the least hungry, sir,\" said Gilbert. \"We lunched at a hotel in the next town.\" Jasper accompanied his father into the house, but Gilbert remained behind five minutes longer. John\u0027s good-natured anxiety for his safety had enlisted his good will, and he thought he would like to chat a while with him. \"You seem to be surprised at my coming home safe,\" he said. \"Yes, sir—shure I am. You\u0027re the only one I know that could manage the ugly brute, let alone a horse-tamer.\" \"But Jasper has ridden on him. Don\u0027t you think I can manage him as well as Jasper?\" \"Mr. Jasper niver has ridden on Bucephalus.\" \"He told me he had,\" said Gilbert, in a tone of surprise. \"Shure, sir, you couldn\u0027t have understood him.\" \"Do you mean to say that he never rode on the horse?\" \"No; and he wouldn\u0027t for a hundred dollars.\" \"What did he mean, then, by telling me he had done so?\" \"Are you sure he told you so, Mr. Gilbert?\" \"Yes; he said he had ridden Bucephalus, but not often, as he preferred his own horse.\" \"Then, savin\u0027 your presince, he told a lie, but you mustn\u0027t tell him I said so.\" \"I won\u0027t betray you; but I don\u0027t see why he should deceive me,\" said Gilbert, regarding the coachman with perplexity. \"Did Mr. Grey ever ride on him?\" \"No, sir, and he wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027d be afraid of his life.\" \"Did you ever ride on him yourself, John?\" \"Yes, sir, I did that same. I rid him once too often. Before I knew where I was I found myself lyin\u0027 in the road lookin\u0027 up to the stars, of which I saw plenty, though it was broad daylight.\" \"How long ago was that?\" \"Two months ago, jist after we got him. I hain\u0027t been on his back since.\" Gilbert now began to look serious. He was beginning to understand a little better how matters stood. \"I shouldn\u0027t think Mr. Grey or Jasper would have let me ride him if he was so dangerous,\" he said, after a pause. \"Nor I,\" said John. \"Faith, they care less for your neck than their own, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027.\" \"It is lucky I am a good rider, or you might never have seen me again. I conquered him, but it wasn\u0027t easy. Six months ago he would have conquered me.\" \"All\u0027s well that ends well,\" said John, philosophically. \"He won\u0027t be up to any more of his tantrums when you are on his back, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027. Horses have a good mimery, and they know their master.\" \"I shall not be afraid to ride him now. But I must go into the house.\" Gilbert entered the house. He did not enter his uncle\u0027s presence at once, but went up to his room and seated himself thoughtfully at the window. \"Can it be that he meant to risk my life?\" he said to himself. \"I am in his way, I know, but is he capable of such a crime?\" He could not decide. He was not prone to think evil of others, yet he felt that it was necessary to be on his guard. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019/83498.html","bookId":262,"book":{"id":262,"title":"Tom, The Bootblack or, The Road to Success","description":"简介： How do you feel this morning, Jacob? asked a boy of fifteen, bending over an old man crouched in the corner of an upper room, in a poor tenement-house, distant less than a quarter of a mile from the New York City Hall....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3019","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
