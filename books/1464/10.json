{"id":38084,"no":10,"title":"IX. — KNEE-DEEP IN KNICKERS","content":"When the column of figures under the heading known as “Profits,” and the column of figures under the heading known as “Loss” are so unevenly balanced that the wrong side of the ledger sags, then to the listening stockholders there comes the painful thought that at the next regular meeting it is perilously possible that the reading may come under the heads of Assets and Liabilities. There had been a meeting in the offices of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company, New York. The quarterly report had had a startlingly lop-sided sound. After it was over Mrs. Emma McChesney, secretary of the company, followed T. A. Buck, its president, into the big, bright show-room. T. A. Buck\u0027s hands were thrust deep into his pockets. His teeth worried a cigar, savagely. Care, that clawing, mouthing hag, perched on his brow, tore at his heart. He turned to face Emma McChesney. “Well,” he said, bitterly, “it hasn\u0027t taken us long, has it? Father\u0027s been dead a little over a year. In that time we\u0027ve just about run this great concern, the pride of his life, into the ground.” Mrs. Emma McChesney, calm, cool, unruffled, scrutinized the harassed man before her for a long minute. “What rotten football material you would have made, wouldn\u0027t you?” she observed. “Oh, I don\u0027t know,” answered T. A. Buck, through his teeth. “I can stand as stiff a scrimmage as the next one. But this isn\u0027t a game. You take things too lightly. You\u0027re a woman. I don\u0027t think you know what this means.” Emma McChesney\u0027s lips opened as do those of one whose tongue\u0027s end holds a quick and stinging retort. Then they closed again. She walked over to the big window that faced the street. When she had stood there a moment, silent, she swung around and came back to where T. A. Buck stood, still wrapped in gloom. “Maybe I don\u0027t take myself seriously. I\u0027d have been dead ten years ago if I had. But I do take my job seriously. Don\u0027t forget that for a minute. You talk the way a man always talks when his pride is hurt.” “Pride! It isn\u0027t that.” “Oh, yes, it is. I didn\u0027t sell T. A. Buck\u0027s Featherloom Petticoats on the road for almost ten years without learning a little something about men and business. When your father died, and I learned that he had shown his appreciation of my work and loyalty by making me secretary of this great company, I didn\u0027t think of it as a legacy—a stroke of good fortune.” “No?” “No. To me it was a sacred trust—something to be guarded, nursed, cherished. And now you say we\u0027ve run this concern into the ground. Do you honestly think that?” T. A. shrugged impotent shoulders. “Figures don\u0027t lie.” He plunged into another fathom of gloom. “Another year like this and we\u0027re done for.” Emma McChesney came over and put one firm hand on T. A. Buck\u0027s drooping shoulder. It was a strange little act for a woman—the sort of thing a man does when he would hearten another man. “Wake up!” she said, lightly. “Wake up, and listen to the birdies sing. There isn\u0027t going to be another year like this. Not if the planning, and scheming, and brain-racking that I\u0027ve been doing for the last two or three months mean anything.” T. A. Buck seated himself as one who is weary, body and mind. “Got another new one?” Emma McChesney regarded him a moment thoughtfully. Then she stepped to the tall show-case, pushed back the sliding glass door, and pointed to the rows of brilliant-hued petticoats that hung close-packed within. “Look at \u0027em!” she commanded, disgust in her voice. “Look at \u0027em!” T. A. Buck raised heavy, lack-luster eyes and looked. What he saw did not seem to interest him. Emma McChesney drew from the rack a skirt of king\u0027s blue satin messaline and held it at arm\u0027s length. “And they call that thing a petticoat! Why, fifteen years ago the material in this skirt wouldn\u0027t have made even a fair-sized sleeve.” T. A. Buck regarded the petticoat moodily. “I don\u0027t see how they get around in the darned things. I honestly don\u0027t see how they wear \u0027em.” “That\u0027s just it. They don\u0027t wear \u0027em. There you have the root of the whole trouble.” “Oh, nonsense!” disputed T. A. “They certainly wear something—some sort of an—” “I tell you they don\u0027t. Here. Listen. Three years ago our taffeta skirts ran from thirty-six to thirty-eight yards to the dozen. We paid from ninety cents to one dollar five a yard. Now our skirts run from twenty-five to twenty-eight yards to the dozen. The silk costs us from fifty to sixty cents a yard. Silk skirts used to be a luxury. Now they\u0027re not even a necessity.” “Well, what\u0027s the answer? I\u0027ve been pondering some petticoat problems myself. I know we\u0027ve got to sell three skirts to-day to make the profit that we used to make on one three years ago.” Emma McChesney had the brave-heartedness to laugh. “This skirt business reminds me of a game we used to play when I was a kid. We called it Going to Jerusalem, I think. Anyway, I know each child sat in a chair except the one who was It. At a signal everybody had to get up and change chairs. There was a wild scramble, in which the one who was It took part. When the burly-burly was over some child was always chairless, of course. He had to be It. That\u0027s the skirt business to-day. There aren\u0027t enough chairs to go round, and in the scramble somebody\u0027s got to be left out. And let me tell you, here and now, that the firm of T. A. Buck, Featherloom Petticoats, is not going to be It.” T. A. rose as wearily as he had sat down. Even the most optimistic of watchers could have discerned no gleam of enthusiasm on his face. “I thought,” he said listlessly, “that you and I had tried every possible scheme to stimulate the skirt trade.” “Every possible one, yes,” agreed Mrs. McChesney, sweetly. “And now it\u0027s time to try the impossible. The possibilities haven\u0027t worked. My land! I could write a book on the Decline and Fall of the Petticoat, beginning with the billowy white muslin variety, and working up to the present slinky messaline affair. When I think of those dear dead days of the glorious—er—past, when the hired girl used to complain and threaten to leave because every woman in the family had at least three ruffled, embroidery-flounced white muslin petticoats on the line on Mondays—” The lines about T. A. Buck\u0027s mouth relaxed into a grim smile. “Remember that feature you got them to run in the Sunday Sphere? The one headed \u0027Are Skirts Growing Fuller, and Where?\u0027” “Do I remember it!” wailed Emma McChesney. “And can I ever forget the money we put into that fringed model we called the Carmencita! We made it up so it could retail for a dollar ninety-five, and I could have sworn that the women would maim each other to get to it. But it didn\u0027t go. They won\u0027t even wear fringe around their ankles.” T. A.\u0027s grim smile stretched into a reminiscent grin. “But nothing in our whole hopeless campaign could touch your Municipal Purity League agitation for the abolition of the form-hugging skirt. You talked public morals until you had A. Comstock and Lucy Page Gaston looking like Parisian Apaches.” A little laugh rippled up to Emma McChesney\u0027s lips, only to die away to a sigh. She shook her head in sorrowful remembrance. “Yes. But what good did it do? The newspapers and magazines did take it up, but what happened? The dressmakers and tailors, who are charging more than ever for their work, and putting in half as much material, got together and knocked my plans into a cocked hat. In answer to those snap-shots showing what took place every time a woman climbed a car step, they came back with pictures of the styles of \u002761, proving that the street-car effect is nothing to what happened to a belle of \u002761 if she chanced to sit down or get up too suddenly in the hoop-skirt days.” They were both laughing now, like a couple of children. “And, oh, say!” gasped Emma, “remember Moe Selig, of the Fine-Form Skirt Company, trying to get the doctors to state that hobble skirts were making women knock-kneed! Oh, mercy!” But their laugh ended in a little rueful silence. It was no laughing matter, this situation. T. A. Buck shrugged his shoulders, and began a restless pacing up and down. “Yep. There you are. Meanwhile—” “Meanwhile, women are still wearing \u0027em tight, and going petticoatless.” Suddenly T. A. stopped short in his pacing and fastened his surprised and interested gaze on the skirt of the trim and correct little business frock that sat so well upon Emma McChesney\u0027s pretty figure. “Why, look at that!” he exclaimed, and pointed with one eager finger. “Mercy!” screamed Emma McChesney. “What is it? Quick! A mouse?” T. A. Buck shook his head, impatiently. “Mouse! Lord, no! Plaits!” “Plaits!” She looked down, bewildered. “Yes. In your skirt. Three plaits at the front-left, and three in the back. That\u0027s new, isn\u0027t it? If outer skirts are being made fuller, then it follows—” “It ought to follow,” interrupted Emma McChesney, “but it doesn\u0027t. It lags way behind. These plaits are stitched down. See? That\u0027s the fiendishness of it. And the petticoat underneath—if there is one—must be just as smooth, and unwrinkled, and scant as ever. Don\u0027t let \u0027em fool you.” Buck spread his palms with a little gesture of utter futility. “I\u0027m through. Out with your scheme. We\u0027re ready for it. It\u0027s our last card, whatever it is.” There was visible on Emma McChesney\u0027s face that little tightening of the muscles, that narrowing of the eyelids which betokens intense earnestness; the gathering of all the forces before taking a momentous step. Then, as quickly, her face cleared. She shook her head with a little air of sudden decision. “Not now. Just because it\u0027s our last card I want to be sure that I\u0027m playing it well. I\u0027ll be ready for you to-morrow morning in my office. Come prepared for the jolt of your young life.” For the first time since the beginning of the conversation a glow of new courage and hope lighted up T. A. Buck\u0027s good-looking features. His fine eyes rested admiringly upon Emma McChesney standing there by the great show-case. She seemed to radiate energy, alertness, confidence. “When you begin to talk like that,” he said, “I always feel as though I could take hold in a way to make those famous jobs that Hercules tackled look like little Willie\u0027s chores after school.” “Fine!” beamed Emma McChesney. “Just store that up, will you? And don\u0027t let it filter out at your finger-tips when I begin to talk to-morrow.” “We\u0027ll have lunch together, eh? And talk it over then sociably.” Mrs. McChesney closed the glass door of the case with a bang. “No, thanks. My office at 9:30.” T. A. Buck followed her to the door. “But why not lunch? You never will take lunch with me. Ever so much more comfortable to talk things over that way—” “When I talk business,” said Emma McChesney, pausing at the threshold, “I want to be surrounded by a business atmosphere. I want the scene all set—one practical desk, two practical chairs, one telephone, one letter-basket, one self-filling fountain-pen, et cetera. And when I lunch I want to lunch, with nothing weightier on my mind than the question as to whether I\u0027ll have chicken livers saute or creamed sweetbreads with mushrooms.” “That\u0027s no reason,” grumbled T. A. “That\u0027s an excuse.” “It will have to do, though,” replied Mrs. McChesney abruptly, and passed out as he held the door open for her. He was still standing in the doorway after her trim, erect figure had disappeared into the little office across the hail. The little scarlet leather clock on Emma McChesney\u0027s desk pointed to 9:29 A.M. when there entered her office an immaculately garbed, miraculously shaven, healthily rosy youngish-middle-aged man who looked ten years younger than the harassed, frowning T. A. Buck with whom she had almost quarreled the evening before. Mrs. McChesney was busily dictating to a sleek little stenographer. The sleek little stenographer glanced up at T. A. Buck\u0027s entrance. The glance, being a feminine one, embraced all of T. A.\u0027s good points and approved them from the tips of his modish boots to the crown of his slightly bald head, and including the creamy-white flower that reposed in his buttonhole. “\u0027Morning!” said Emma McChesney, looking up briefly. “Be with you in a minute.... and in reply would say we regret that you have had trouble with No. 339. It is impossible to avoid pulling at the seams in the lower-grade silk skirts when they are made up in the present scant style. Our Mr. Spalding warned you of this at the time of your purchase. We will not under any circumstances consent to receive the goods if they are sent back on our hands. Yours sincerely. That\u0027ll be all, Miss Casey.” She swung around to face her visitor as the door closed. If T. A. Buck looked ten years younger than he had the afternoon before, Emma McChesney undoubtedly looked five years older. There were little, worried, sagging lines about her eyes and mouth. T. A. Buck\u0027s eyes had followed the sheaf of signed correspondence, and the well-filled pad of more recent dictation which the sleek little stenographer had carried away with her. “Good Lord! It looks as though you had stayed down here all night.” Emma McChesney smiled a little wearily. “Not quite that. But I was here this morning in time to greet the night watchman. Wanted to get my mail out of the way.” Her eyes searched T. A. Buck\u0027s serene face. Then she leaned forward, earnestly. “Haven\u0027t you seen the morning paper?” “Just a mere glance at \u0027em. Picked up Burrows on the way down, and we got to talking. Why?” “The Rasmussen-Welsh Skirt Company has failed. Liabilities three hundred thousand. Assets one hundred thousand.” “Failed! Good God!” All the rosy color, all the brisk morning freshness had vanished from his face. “Failed! Why, girl, I thought that concern was as solid as Gibraltar.” He passed a worried hand over his head. “That knocks the wind out of my sails.” “Don\u0027t let it. Just say that it fills them with a new breeze. I\u0027m all the more sure that the time is ripe for my plan.” T. A. Buck took from a vest pocket a scrap of paper and a fountain pen, slid down in his chair, crossed his legs, and began to scrawl meaningless twists and curlycues, as was his wont when worried or deeply interested. “Are you as sure of this scheme of yours as you were yesterday?” “Sure,” replied Emma McChesney, briskly. “Sartin-sure.” “Then fire away.” Mrs. McChesney leaned forward, breathing a trifle fast. Her eyes were fastened on her listener. “Here\u0027s the plan. We\u0027ll make Featherloom Petticoats because there still are some women who have kept their senses. But we\u0027ll make them as a side line. The thing that has got to keep us afloat until full skirts come in again will be a full and complete line of women\u0027s satin messaline knickerbockers made up to match any suit or gown, and a full line of pajamas for women and girls. Get the idea? Scant, smart, trim little taupe-gray messaline knickers for a taupe gray suit, blue messaline for blue suits, brown messaline for brown—” T. A. Buck stared, open-mouthed, the paper on which he had been scrawling fluttering unnoticed to the floor. “Look here!” he interrupted. “Is this supposed to be humorous?” “And,” went on Emma McChesney, calmly, “in our full and complete, not to say nifty line of women\u0027s pajamas—pink pajamas, blue pajamas, violet pajamas, yellow pajamas, white silk—” T. A. Buck stood up. “I want to say,” he began, “that if you are jesting, I think this is a mighty poor time to joke. And if you are serious I can only deduce from it that this year of business worry and responsibility has been too much for you. I\u0027m sure that if you were—” “That\u0027s all right,” interrupted Emma McChesney. “Don\u0027t apologize. I purposely broke it to you this way, when I might have approached it gently. You\u0027ve done just what I knew you\u0027d do, so it\u0027s all right. After you\u0027ve thought it over, and sort of got chummy with the idea, you\u0027ll be just as keen on it as I am.” “Never!” “Oh, yes, you will. It\u0027s the knickerbocker end of it that scares you. Nothing new or startling about pajamas, except that more and more women are wearing \u0027em, and that no girl would dream of going away to school without her six sets of pajamas. Why, a girl in a regulation nightie at one of their midnight spreads would be ostracized. Of course I\u0027ve thought up a couple of new kinks in \u0027em—new ways of cutting and all that, and there\u0027s one model—a washable crepe, for traveling, that doesn\u0027t need to be pressed—but I\u0027ll talk about that later.” T. A. Buck was trying to put in a word of objection, but she would have none of it. But at Emma McChesney\u0027s next words his indignation would brook no barriers. “Now,” she went on, “the feature of the knickerbockers will be this: They\u0027ve got to be ready for the boys\u0027 spring trip, and in all the larger cities, especially in the hustling Middle-Western towns, and along the coast, too, I\u0027m planning to have the knickerbockers introduced at private and exclusive exhibitions, and worn by—get this, please—worn by living models. One big store in each town, see? Half a dozen good-looking girls—” “Never!” shouted T. A. Buck, white and shaking. “Never! This firm has always had a name for dignity, solidness, conservatism—” “Then it\u0027s just about time it lost that reputation. It\u0027s all very well to hang on to your dignity when you\u0027re on solid ground, but when you feel things slipping from under you the thing to do is to grab on to anything that\u0027ll keep you on your feet for a while at least. I tell you the women will go wild over this knickerbocker idea. They\u0027ve been waiting for it.” “It\u0027s a wild-cat scheme,” disputed Buck hotly. “It\u0027s a drowning man\u0027s straw, and just about as helpful. I\u0027m a reasonable man—” “All unreasonable men say that,” smiled Emma McChesney. “—I\u0027m a reasonable man, I say. And heaven knows I have the interest of this firm at heart. But this is going too far. If we\u0027re going to smash we\u0027ll go decently, and with our name untarnished. Pajamas are bad enough. But when it comes to the firm of T. A. Buck being represented by—by—living model hussies stalking about in satin tights like chorus girls, why—” In Emma McChesney\u0027s alert, electric mind there leapt about a dozen plans for winning this man over. For win him she would, in the end. It was merely a question of method. She chose the simplest. There was a set look about her jaw. Her eyes flashed. Two spots of carmine glowed in her cheeks. “I expected just this,” she said. “And I prepared for it.” She crossed swiftly to her desk, opened a drawer, and took out a flat package. “I expected opposition. That\u0027s why I had these samples made up to show you. I designed them myself, and tore up fifty patterns before I struck one that suited me. Here are the pajamas.” She lifted out a dainty, shell-pink garment, and shook it out before the half-interested, half-unwilling eyes of T. A. Buck. “This is the jacket. Buttons on the left; see? Instead of the right, as it would in a man\u0027s garment. Semi-sailor collar, with knotted soft silk scarf. Oh, it\u0027s just a little kink, but they\u0027ll love it. They\u0027re actually becoming. I\u0027ve tried \u0027em. Notice the frogs and cord. Pretty neat, yes? Slight flare at the hips. Makes \u0027em set and hang right. Perfectly straight, like a man\u0027s coat.” T. A. Buck eyed the garments with a grudging admiration. “Oh, that part of it don\u0027t sound so unreasonable, although I don\u0027t believe there is much of a demand for that kind of thing. But the other—-the—the knickerbocker things—that\u0027s not even practical. It will make an ugly garment, and the women who would fall for a fad like that wouldn\u0027t be of the sort to wear an ugly piece of lingerie. It isn\u0027t to be thought of seriously—” Emma McChesney stepped to the door of the tiny wash-room off her office and threw it open. “Miss La Noyes! We\u0027re ready for you.” And there emerged from the inner room a trim, lithe, almost boyishly slim figure attired in a bewitchingly skittish-looking garment consisting of knickerbockers and snug brassiere of king\u0027s blue satin messaline. Dainty black silk stockings and tiny buckled slippers set off the whole effect. “Miss La Noyes,” said Emma McChesney, almost solemnly, “this is Mr. T. A. Buck, president of the firm. Miss La Noyes, of the \u0027Gay Social Whirl\u0027 company.” Miss La Noyes bowed slightly and rested one white hand at her side in an attitude of nonchalant ease. “Pleased, I\u0027m shaw!” she said, in a clear, high voice. And, “Charmed,” replied T. A. Buck, his years and breeding standing him in good stead now. Emma McChesney laid a kindly hand on the girl\u0027s shoulder. “Turn slowly, please. Observe the absence of unnecessary fulness about the hips, or at the knees. No wrinkles to show there. No man will ever appreciate the fine points of this little garment, but the women!—To the left, Miss La Noyes. You\u0027ll see it fastens snug and trim with a tiny clasp just below the knees. This garment has the added attraction of being fastened to the upper garment, a tight satin brassiere. The single, unattached garment is just as satisfactory, however. Women are wearing plush this year. Not only for the street, but for evening dresses. I rather think they\u0027ll fancy a snappy little pair of yellow satin knickers under a gown of the new orange plush. Or a taupe pair, under a gray street suit. Or a natty little pair of black satin, finished and piped in white satin, to be worn with a black and white shopping costume. Why, I haven\u0027t worn a petticoat since I—” “Do you mean to tell me,” burst from the long-pent T. A. Buck, “that you wear \u0027em too?” “Crazy about \u0027em. Miss La Noyes, will you just slip on your street skirt, please?” She waited in silence until the demure Miss La Noyes reappeared. A narrow, straight-hanging, wrinkleless cloth skirt covered the much discussed under-garment. “Turn slowly, please. Thanks. You see, Mr. Buck? Not a wrinkle. No bunchiness. No lumps. No crawling up about the knees. Nothing but ease, and comfort, and trim good looks.” T. A. Buck passed his hand over his head in a dazed, helpless gesture. There was something pathetic in his utter bewilderment and helplessness in contrast with Emma McChesney\u0027s breezy self-confidence, and the show-girl\u0027s cool poise and unconcern. “Wait a minute,” he murmured, almost pleadingly. “Let me ask a couple of questions, will you?” “Questions? A hundred. That proves you\u0027re interested.” “Well, then, let me ask this young lady the first one. Miss—er—La Noyes, do you honestly and truly like this garment? Would you buy one if you saw it in a shop window?” Miss La Noyes\u0027 answer came trippingly and without hesitation. She did not even have to feel of her back hair first. “Say, I\u0027d go without my lunch for a week to get it. Mrs. McChesney says I can have this pair. I can\u0027t wait till our prima donna sees \u0027em. She\u0027ll hate me till she\u0027s got a dozen like \u0027em.” “Next!” urged Mrs. McChesney, pleasantly. But T. A. Buck shook his head. “That\u0027s all. Only—” Emma McChesney patted Miss La Noyes lightly on the shoulder, and smiled dazzlingly upon her. “Run along, little girl. You\u0027ve done beautifully. And many thanks.” Miss La Noyes, appearing in another moment dressed for the street, stopped at the door to bestow a frankly admiring smile upon the abstracted president of the company, and a grateful one upon its pink-cheeked secretary. “Hope you\u0027ll come and see our show some evening. You won\u0027t know me at first, because I wear a blond wig in the first scene. Third from the left, front row.” And to Mrs. McChesney: “I cer\u0027nly did hate to get up so early this morning, but after you\u0027re up it ain\u0027t so fierce. And it cer\u0027nly was easy money. Thanks.” {Illustration: “\u0027No man will ever appreciate the fine points of this little garment, but the women—!\u0027”} Emma McChesney glanced quickly at T. A., saw that he was pliant enough for the molding process, and deftly began to shape, and bend, and smooth and pat. “Let\u0027s sit down, and unravel the kinks in our nerves. Now, if you do favor this new plan—oh, I mean after you\u0027ve given it consideration, and all that! Yes, indeed. But if you do, I think it would be good policy to start the game in—say—Cleveland. The Kaufman-Oster Company of Cleveland have a big, snappy, up-to-the-minute store. We\u0027ll get them to send out announcement cards. Something neat and flattering-looking. See? Little stage all framed up. Scene set to show a bedroom or boudoir. Then, thin girls, plump girls, short girls, high girls. They\u0027ll go through all the paces. We won\u0027t only show the knickerbockers: we demonstrate how the ordinary petticoat bunches and crawls up under the heavy plush and velvet top skirt. We\u0027ll show \u0027em in street clothes, evening clothes, afternoon frocks. Each one in a different shade of satin knicker. And silk stockings and cunning little slippers to match. The store will stand for that. It\u0027s a big ad for them, too.” Emma McChesney\u0027s hair was slightly tousled. Her cheeks were carmine. Her eyes glowed. “Don\u0027t you see! Don\u0027t you get it! Can\u0027t you feel how the thing\u0027s going to take hold?” “By Gad!” burst from T. A. Buck, “I\u0027m darned if I don\u0027t believe you\u0027re right—almost—But are you sure that you believe—” Emma McChesney brought one little white fist down into the palm of the other hand. “Sure? Why, I\u0027m so sure that when I shut my eyes I can see T. A. Senior sitting over there in that chair, tapping the side of his nose with the edge of his tortoise-shell-rimmed glasses, and nodding his head, with his features all screwed up like a blessed old gargoyle, the way he always did when something tickled him. That\u0027s how sure I am.” T. A. Buck stood up abruptly. He shrugged his shoulders. His face looked strangely white and drawn. “I\u0027ll leave it to you. I\u0027ll do my share of the work. But I\u0027m not more than half convinced, remember.” “That\u0027s enough for the present,” answered Emma McChesney, briskly. “Well, now, suppose we talk machinery and girls, and cutters for a while.” Two months later found T. A. Buck and his sales-manager, both shirt-sleeved, both smoking nervously, as they marked, ticketed, folded, arranged. They were getting out the travelers\u0027 spring lines. Entered Mrs. McChesney, and stood eying them, worriedly. It was her dozenth visit to the stock-room that morning. A strange restlessness seemed to trouble her. She wandered from office to show-room, from show-room to factory. “What\u0027s the trouble?” inquired T. A. Buck, squinting up at her through a cloud of cigar smoke. “Oh, nothing,” answered Mrs. McChesney, and stood fingering the piles of glistening satin garments, a queer, faraway look in her eyes. Then she turned and walked listlessly toward the door. There she encountered Spalding—Billy Spalding, of the coveted Middle-Western territory, Billy Spalding, the long-headed, quick-thinking; Spalding, the persuasive, Spalding the mixer, Spalding on whom depended the fate of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Knickerbocker and Pajama. “\u0027Morning! When do you start out?” she asked him. “In the morning. Gad, that\u0027s some line, what? I\u0027m itching to spread it. You\u0027re certainly a wonder-child, Mrs. McChesney. Why, the boys—” Emma McChesney sighed, somberly. “That line does sort of—well, tug at your heart-strings, doesn\u0027t it?” She smiled, almost wistfully. “Say, Billy, when you reach the Eagle House at Waterloo, tell Annie, the head-waitress to rustle you a couple of Mrs. Traudt\u0027s dill pickles. Tell her Mrs. McChesney asked you to. Mrs. Traudt, the proprietor\u0027s wife, doles \u0027em out to her favorites. They\u0027re crisp, you know, and firm, and juicy, and cold, and briny.” Spalding drew a sibilant breath. “I\u0027ll be there!” he grinned. “I\u0027ll be there!” But he wasn\u0027t. At eight the next morning there burst upon Mrs. McChesney a distraught T. A. Buck. “Hear about Spalding?” he demanded. “Spalding? No.” “His wife \u0027phoned from St. Luke\u0027s. Taken with an appendicitis attack at midnight. They operated at five this morning. One of those had-it-been-twenty-four-hours-later-etc. operations. That settles us.” “Poor kid,” replied Emma McChesney. “Rough on him and his brand-new wife.” “Poor kid! Yes. But how about his territory? How about our new line? How about—” “Oh, that\u0027s all right,” said Emma McChesney, cheerfully. “I\u0027d like to know how! We haven\u0027t a man equal to the territory. He\u0027s our one best bet.” “Oh, that\u0027s all right,” said Mrs. McChesney again, smoothly. A little impatient exclamation broke from T. A. Buck. At that Emma McChesney smiled. Her new listlessness and abstraction seemed to drop from her. She braced her shoulders, and smiled her old sunny, heartening smile. “I\u0027m going out with that line. I\u0027m going to leave a trail of pajamas and knickerbockers from Duluth to Canton.” “You! No, you won\u0027t!” A dull, painful red had swept into T. A. Buck\u0027s face. It was answered by a flood of scarlet in Mrs. McChesney\u0027s countenance. “I don\u0027t get you,” she said. “I\u0027m afraid you don\u0027t realize what this trip means. It\u0027s going to be a fight. They\u0027ll have to be coaxed and bullied and cajoled, and reasoned with. It\u0027s going to be a \u0027show-me\u0027 trip.” T. A. Buck took a quick step forward. “That\u0027s just why. I won\u0027t have you fighting with buyers, taking their insults, kowtowing to them, salving them. It—it isn\u0027t woman\u0027s work.” Emma McChesney was sorting the contents of her desk with quick, nervous fingers. “I\u0027ll get the Twentieth Century,” she said, over her shoulder. “Don\u0027t argue, please. If it\u0027s no work for a woman then I suppose it follows that I\u0027m unwomanly. For ten years I traveled this country selling T. A. Buck\u0027s Featherloom Petticoats. My first trip on the road I was in the twenties—and pretty, too. I\u0027m a woman of thirty-seven now. I\u0027ll never forget that first trip—the heartbreaks, the insults I endured, the disappointments, the humiliation, until they understood that I meant business—strictly business. I\u0027m tired of hearing you men say that this and that and the other isn\u0027t woman\u0027s work. Any work is woman\u0027s work that a woman can do well. I\u0027ve given the ten best years of my life to this firm. Next to my boy at school it\u0027s the biggest thing in my life. Sometimes it swamps even him. Don\u0027t come to me with that sort of talk.” She was locking drawers, searching pigeon-holes, skimming files. “This is my busy day.” She arose, and shut her desk with a bang, locked it, and turned a flushed and beaming face toward T. A. Buck, as he stood frowning before her. {Illustration: “Emma McChesney... I believe in you now! Dad and I both believe in you\u0027”} “Your father believed in me—from the ground up. We understood each other, he and I. You\u0027ve learned a lot in the last year and a half, T. A. Junior-that-was, but there\u0027s one thing you haven\u0027t mastered. When will you learn to believe in Emma McChesney?” She was out of the office before he had time to answer, leaving him standing there. In the dusk of a late winter evening just three weeks later, a man paused at the door of the unlighted office marked “Mrs. McChesney.” He looked about a moment, as though dreading detection. Then he opened the door, stepped into the dim quiet of the little room, and closed the door gently after him. Everything in the tiny room was quiet, neat, orderly. It seemed to possess something of the character of its absent owner. The intruder stood there a moment, uncertainly, looking about him. Then he took a step forward and laid one hand on the back of the empty chair before the closed desk. He shut his eyes and it seemed that he felt her firm, cool, reassuring grip on his fingers as they clutched the wooden chair. The impression was so strong that he kept his eyes shut, and they were still closed when his voice broke the silence of the dim, quiet little room. “Emma McChesney,” he was saying aloud, “Emma McChesney, you great big, fine, brave, wonderful woman, you! I believe in you now! Dad and I both believe in you.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2694/74077.html","bookId":1464,"book":{"id":1464,"title":"Roast Beef, Medium","description":"简介： Seated at Life\u0027s Dining Table, with the Menu of Morals before you, your eye wanders a bit over the entrees, the hors d\u0027oeuvres, and the things a la, though you know that Roast Beef, Medium, is safe, and sane, and sure.
