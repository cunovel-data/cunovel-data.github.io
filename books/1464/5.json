{"id":38079,"no":5,"title":"IV. — HIS MOTHER\u0027S SON","content":"“Full?” repeated Emma McChesney (and if it weren\u0027t for the compositor there\u0027d be an exclamation point after that question mark). “Sorry, Mrs. McChesney,” said the clerk, and he actually looked it, “but there\u0027s absolutely nothing stirring. We\u0027re full up. The Benevolent Brotherhood of Bisons is holding its regular annual state convention here. We\u0027re putting up cots in the hall.” Emma McChesney\u0027s keen blue eyes glanced up from their inspection of the little bunch of mail which had just been handed her. “Well, pick out a hall with a southern exposure and set up a cot or so for me,” she said, agreeably; “because I\u0027ve come to stay. After selling Featherloom Petticoats on the road for ten years I don\u0027t see myself trailing up and down this town looking for a place to lay my head. I\u0027ve learned this one large, immovable truth, and that is, that a hotel clerk is a hotel clerk. It makes no difference whether he is stuck back of a marble pillar and hidden by a gold vase full of thirty-six-inch American Beauty roses at the Knickerbocker, or setting the late fall fashions for men in Galesburg, Illinois.” By one small degree was the perfect poise of the peerless personage behind the register jarred. But by only one. He was a hotel night clerk. “It won\u0027t do you any good to get sore, Mrs. McChesney,” he began, suavely. “Now a man would—” “But I\u0027m not a man,” interrupted Emma McChesney. “I\u0027m only doing a man\u0027s work and earning a man\u0027s salary and demanding to be treated with as much consideration as you\u0027d show a man.” The personage busied himself mightily with a pen, and a blotter, and sundry papers, as is the manner of personages when annoyed. “I\u0027d like to accommodate you; I\u0027d like to do it.” “Cheer up,” said Emma McChesney, “you\u0027re going to. I don\u0027t mind a little discomfort. Though I want to mention in passing that if there are any lady Bisons present you needn\u0027t bank on doubling me up with them. I\u0027ve had one experience of that kind. It was in Albia, Iowa. I\u0027d sleep in the kitchen range before I\u0027d go through another.” Up went the erstwhile falling poise. “You\u0027re badly mistaken, madam. I\u0027m a member of this order myself, and a finer lot of fellows it has never been my pleasure to know.” “Yes, I know,” drawled Emma McChesney. “Do you know, the thing that gets me is the inconsistency of it. Along come a lot of boobs who never use a hotel the year around except to loaf in the lobby, and wear out the leather chairs, and use up the matches and toothpicks and get the baseball returns, and immediately you turn away a traveling man who uses a three-dollar-a-day room, with a sample room downstairs for his stuff, who tips every porter and bell-boy in the place, asks for no favors, and who, if you give him a half-way decent cup of coffee for breakfast, will fall in love with the place and boom it all over the country. Half of your Benevolent Bisons are here on the European plan, with a view to patronizing the free-lunch counters or being asked to take dinner at the home of some local Bison whose wife has been cooking up on pies, and chicken salad and veal roast for the last week.” {Illustration: “\u0027Son!\u0027 echoed the clerk, staring\"} Emma McChesney leaned over the desk a little, and lowered her voice to the tone of confidence. “Now, I\u0027m not in the habit of making a nuisance of myself like this. I don\u0027t get so chatty as a rule, and I know that I could jump over to Monmouth and get first-class accommodations there. But just this once I\u0027ve a good reason for wanting to make you and myself a little miserable. Y\u0027see, my son is traveling with me this trip.” “Son!” echoed the clerk, staring. “Thanks. That\u0027s what they all do. After a while I\u0027ll begin to believe that there must be something hauntingly beautiful and girlish about me or every one wouldn\u0027t petrify when I announce that I\u0027ve a six-foot son attached to my apron-strings. He looks twenty-one, but he\u0027s seventeen. He thinks the world\u0027s rotten because he can\u0027t grow one of those fuzzy little mustaches that the men are cultivating to match their hats. He\u0027s down at the depot now, straightening out our baggage. Now I want to say this before he gets here. He\u0027s been out with me just four days. Those four days have been a revelation, an eye-opener, and a series of rude jolts. He used to think that his mother\u0027s job consisted of traveling in Pullmans, eating delicate viands turned out by the hotel chefs, and strewing Featherloom Petticoats along the path. I gave him plenty of money, and he got into the habit of looking lightly upon anything more trifling than a five-dollar bill. He\u0027s changing his mind by great leaps. I\u0027m prepared to spend the night in the coal cellar if you\u0027ll just fix him up—not too comfortably. It\u0027ll be a great lesson for him. There he is now. Just coming in. Fuzzy coat and hat and English stick. Hist! As they say on the stage.” The boy crossed the crowded lobby. There was a little worried, annoyed frown between his eyes. He laid a protecting hand on his mother\u0027s arm. Emma McChesney was conscious of a little thrill of pride as she realized that he did not have to look up to meet her gaze. “Look here, Mother, they tell me there\u0027s some sort of a convention here, and the town\u0027s packed. That\u0027s what all those banners and things were for. I hope they\u0027ve got something decent for us here. I came up with a man who said he didn\u0027t think there was a hole left to sleep in.” “You don\u0027t say!” exclaimed Emma McChesney, and turned to the clerk. “This is my son, Jock McChesney—Mr. Sims. Is this true?” “Glad to know you, sir,” said Mr. Sims. “Why, yes, I\u0027m afraid we are pretty well filled up, but seeing it\u0027s you maybe we can do something for you.” He ruminated, tapping his teeth with a pen-holder, and eying the pair before him with a maddening blankness of gaze. Finally: “I\u0027ll do my best, but you can\u0027t expect much. I guess I can squeeze another cot into eighty-seven for the young man. There\u0027s—let\u0027s see now—who\u0027s in eighty-seven? Well, there\u0027s two Bisons in the double bed, and one in the single, and Fat Ed Meyers in the cot and—” Emma McChesney stiffened into acute attention. “Meyers?” she interrupted. “Do you mean Ed Meyers of the Strauss Sans-silk Skirt Company?” “That\u0027s so. You two are in the same line, aren\u0027t you? He\u0027s a great little piano player, Ed is. Ever hear him play?” “When did he get in?” “Oh, he just came in fifteen minutes ago on the Ashland division. He\u0027s in at supper.” “Oh,” said Emma McChesney. The two letters breathed relief. But relief had no place in the voice, or on the countenance of Jock McChesney. He bristled with belligerence. “This cattle-car style of sleeping don\u0027t make a hit. I haven\u0027t had a decent night\u0027s rest for three nights. I never could sleep on a sleeper. Can\u0027t you fix us up better than that?” “Best I can do.” “But where\u0027s mother going? I see you advertise three \u0027large and commodious steam-heated sample rooms in connection.\u0027 I suppose mother\u0027s due to sleep on one of the tables there.” “Jock,” Emma McChesney reproved him, “Mr. Sims is doing us a great favor. There isn\u0027t another hotel in town that would—” “You\u0027re right, there isn\u0027t,” agreed Mr. Sims. “I guess the young man is new to this traveling game. As I said, I\u0027d like to accommodate you, but—Let\u0027s see now. Tell you what I\u0027ll do. If I can get the housekeeper to go over and sleep in the maids\u0027 quarters just for to-night, you can use her room. There you are! Of course, it\u0027s over the kitchen, and there may be some little noise early in the morning—” Emma McChesney raised a protesting hand. “Don\u0027t mention it. Just lead me thither. I\u0027m so tired I could sleep in an excursion special that was switching at Pittsburgh. Jock, me child, we\u0027re in luck. That\u0027s twice in the same place. The first time was when we were inspired to eat our supper on the diner instead of waiting until we reached here to take the leftovers from the Bisons\u0027 grazing. I hope that housekeeper hasn\u0027t a picture of her departed husband dangling, life-size, on the wall at the foot of the bed. But they always have. Good-night, son. Don\u0027t let the Bisons bite you. I\u0027ll be up at seven.” But it was just 6:30 A.M. when Emma McChesney turned the little bend in the stairway that led to the office. The scrub-woman was still in possession. The cigar-counter girl had not yet made her appearance. There was about the place a general air of the night before. All but the night clerk. He was as spruce and trim, and alert and smooth-shaven as only a night clerk can be after a night\u0027s vigil. “\u0027Morning!” Emma McChesney called to him. She wore blue serge, and a smart fall hat. The late autumn morning was not crisper and sunnier than she. “Good-morning, Mrs. McChesney,” returned Mr. Sims, sonorously. “Have a good night\u0027s sleep? I hope the kitchen noises didn\u0027t wake you.” Emma McChesney paused with her hand on the door. “Kitchen? Oh, no. I could sleep through a vaudeville china-juggling act. But—-what an extraordinarily unpleasant-looking man that housekeeper\u0027s husband must have been.” That November morning boasted all those qualities which November-morning writers are so prone to bestow upon the month. But the words wine, and sparkle, and sting, and glow, and snap do not seem to cover it. Emma McChesney stood on the bottom step, looking up and down Main Street and breathing in great draughts of that unadjectivable air. Her complexion stood the test of the merciless, astringent morning and came up triumphantly and healthily firm and pink and smooth. The town was still asleep. She started to walk briskly down the bare and ugly Main Street of the little town. In her big, generous heart, and her keen, alert mind, there were many sensations and myriad thoughts, but varied and diverse as they were they all led back to the boy up there in the stuffy, over-crowded hotel room—the boy who was learning his lesson. Half an hour later she reentered the hotel, her cheeks glowing. Jock was not yet down. So she ordered and ate her wise and cautious breakfast of fruit and cereal and toast and coffee, skimming over her morning paper as she ate. At 7:30 she was back in the lobby, newspaper in hand. The Bisons were already astir. She seated herself in a deep chair in a quiet corner, her eyes glancing up over the top of her paper toward the stairway. At eight o\u0027clock Jock McChesney came down. There was nothing of jauntiness about him. His eyelids were red. His face had the doughy look of one whose sleep has been brief and feverish. As he came toward his mother you noticed a stain on his coat, and a sunburst of wrinkles across one leg of his modish brown trousers. “Good-morning, son!” said Emma McChesney. “Was it as bad as that?” Jock McChesney\u0027s long fingers curled into a fist. “Say,” he began, his tone venomous, “do you know what those—those—those—” “Say it!” commanded Emma McChesney. “I\u0027m only your mother. If you keep that in your system your breakfast will curdle in your stomach.” Jock McChesney said it. I know no phrase better fitted to describe his tone than that old favorite of the erotic novelties. It was vibrant with passion. It breathed bitterness. It sizzled with savagery. It—Oh, alliteration is useless. “Well,” said Emma McChesney, encouragingly, “go on.” {Illustration: “\u0027Well!\u0027 gulped Jock, \u0027those two double-bedded, bloomin\u0027 blasted Bisons—\u0027\"} “Well!” gulped Jock McChesney, and glared; “those two double-bedded, bloomin\u0027, blasted Bisons came in at twelve, and the single one about fifteen minutes later. They didn\u0027t surprise me. There was a herd of about ninety-three of \u0027em in the hall, all saying good-night to each other, and planning where they\u0027d meet in the morning, and the time, and place and probable weather conditions. For that matter, there were droves of \u0027em pounding up and down the halls all night. I never saw such restless cattle. If you\u0027ll tell me what makes more noise in the middle of the night than the metal disk of a hotel key banging and clanging up against a door, I\u0027d like to know what it is. My three Bisons were all dolled up with fool ribbons and badges and striped paper canes. When they switched on the light I gave a crack imitation of a tired working man trying to get a little sleep. I breathed regularly and heavily, with an occasional moaning snore. But if those two hippopotamus Bisons had been alone on their native plains they couldn\u0027t have cared less. They bellowed, and pawed the earth, and threw their shoes around, and yawned, and stretched and discussed their plans for the next day, and reviewed all their doings of that day. Then one of them said something about turning in, and I was so happy I forgot to snore. Just then another key clanged at the door, in walked a fat man in a brown suit and a brown derby, and stuff was off.” “That,” said Emma McChesney, “would be Ed Meyers, of the Strauss Sans-silk Skirt Company.” “None other than our hero.” Jock\u0027s tone had an added acidity. “It took those four about two minutes to get acquainted. In three minutes they had told their real names, and it turned out that Meyers belonged to an organization that was a second cousin of the Bisons. In five minutes they had got together a deck and a pile of chips and were shirt-sleeving it around a game of pinochle. I would doze off to the slap of cards, and the click of chips, and wake up when the bell-boy came in with another round, which he did every six minutes. When I got up this morning I found that Fat Ed Meyers had been sitting on the chair over which I trustingly had draped my trousers. This sunburst of wrinkles is where he mostly sat. This spot on my coat is where a Bison drank his beer.” Emma McChesney folded her paper and rose, smiling. “It is sort of trying, I suppose, if you\u0027re not used to it.” “Used to it!” shouted the outraged Jock. “Used to it! Do you mean to tell me there\u0027s nothing unusual about—” “Not a thing. Oh, of course you don\u0027t strike a bunch of Bisons every day. But it happens a good many times. The world is full of Ancient Orders and they\u0027re everlastingly getting together and drawing up resolutions and electing officers. Don\u0027t you think you\u0027d better go in to breakfast before the Bisons begin to forage? I\u0027ve had mine.” The gloom which had overspread Jock McChesney\u0027s face lifted a little. The hungry boy in him was uppermost. “That\u0027s so. I\u0027m going to have some wheat cakes, and steak, and eggs, and coffee, and fruit, and toast, and rolls.” “Why slight the fish?” inquired his mother. Then, as he turned toward the dining-room, “I\u0027ve two letters to get out. Then I\u0027m going down the street to see a customer. I\u0027ll be up at the Sulzberg-Stein department store at nine sharp. There\u0027s no use trying to see old Sulzberg before ten, but I\u0027ll be there, anyway, and so will Ed Meyers, or I\u0027m no skirt salesman. I want you to meet me there. It will do you good to watch how the overripe orders just drop, ker-plunk, into my lap.” Maybe you know Sulzberg \u0026 Stein\u0027s big store? No? That\u0027s because you\u0027ve always lived in the city. Old Sulzberg sends his buyers to the New York market twice a year, and they need two floor managers on the main floor now. The money those people spend for red and green decorations at Christmas time, and apple-blossoms and pink crepe paper shades in the spring, must be something awful. Young Stein goes to Chicago to have his clothes made, and old Sulzberg likes to keep the traveling men waiting in the little ante-room outside his private office. Jock McChesney finished his huge breakfast, strolled over to Sulzberg \u0026 Stein\u0027s, and inquired his way to the office only to find that his mother was not yet there. There were three men in the little waiting-room. One of them was Fat Ed Meyers. His huge bulk overflowed the spindle-legged chair on which he sat. His brown derby was in his hands. His eyes were on the closed door at the other side of the room. So were the eyes of the other two travelers. Jock took a vacant seat next to Fat Ed Meyers so that he might, in his mind\u0027s eye, pick out a particularly choice spot upon which his hard young fist might land—if only he had the chance. Breaking up a man\u0027s sleep like that, the great big overgrown mutt! “What\u0027s your line?” said Ed Meyers, suddenly turning toward Jock. Prompted by some imp—“Skirts,” answered Jock. “Ladies\u0027 petticoats.” (“As if men ever wore \u0027em!” he giggled inwardly.) Ed Meyers shifted around in his chair so that he might better stare at this new foe in the field. His little red mouth was open ludicrously. “Who\u0027re you out for?” he demanded next. There was a look of Emma McChesney on Jock\u0027s face. “Why—er—the union Underskirt and Hosiery Company of Chicago. New concern.” “Must be,” ruminated Ed Meyers. “I never heard of \u0027em, and I know \u0027em all. You\u0027re starting in young, ain\u0027t you, kid! Well, it\u0027ll never hurt you. You\u0027ll learn something new every day. Now me, I—” In breezed Emma McChesney. Her quick glance rested immediately upon Meyers and the boy. And in that moment some instinct prompted Jock McChesney to shake his head, ever so slightly, and assume a blankness of expression. And Emma McChesney, with that shrewdness which had made her one of the best salesmen on the road, saw, and miraculously understood. “How do, Mrs. McChesney,” grinned Fat Ed Meyers. “You see I beat you to it.” “So I see,” smiled Emma, cheerfully. “I was delayed. Just sold a nice little bill to Watkins down the Street.” She seated herself across the way, and kept her eyes on that closed door. “Say, kid,” Meyers began, in the husky whisper of the fat man, “I\u0027m going to put you wise to something, seeing you\u0027re new to this game. See that lady over there?” He nodded discreetly in Emma McChesney\u0027s direction. “Pretty, isn\u0027t she?” said Jock, appreciatively. “Know who she is?” “Well—I—she does look familiar but—” “Oh, come now, quit your bluffing. If you\u0027d ever met that dame you\u0027d remember it. Her name\u0027s McChesney—Emma McChesney, and she sells T. A. Buck\u0027s Featherloom Petticoats. I\u0027ll give her her dues; she\u0027s the best little salesman on the road. I\u0027ll bet that girl could sell a ruffled, accordion-plaited underskirt to a fat woman who was trying to reduce. She\u0027s got the darndest way with her. And at that she\u0027s straight, too.” If Ed Meyers had not been gazing so intently into his hat, trying at the same time to look cherubically benign he might have seen a quick and painful scarlet sweep the face of the boy, coupled with a certain tense look of the muscles around the jaw. “Well, now, look here,” he went on, still in a whisper. “We\u0027re both skirt men, you and me. Everything\u0027s fair in this game. Maybe you don\u0027t know it, but when there\u0027s a bunch of the boys waiting around to see the head of the store like this, and there happens to be a lady traveler in the crowd, why, it\u0027s considered kind of a professional courtesy to let the lady have the first look-in. See? It ain\u0027t so often that three people in the same line get together like this. She knows it, and she\u0027s sitting on the edge of her chair, waiting to bolt when that door opens, even if she does act like she was hanging on the words of that lady clerk there. The minute it does open a crack she\u0027ll jump up and give me a fleeting, grateful smile, and sail in and cop a fat order away from the old man and his skirt buyer. I\u0027m wise. Say, he may be an oyster, but he knows a pretty woman when he sees one. By the time she\u0027s through with him he\u0027ll have enough petticoats on hand to last him from now until Turkey goes suffrage. Get me?” “I get you,” answered Jock. “I say, this is business, and good manners be hanged. When a woman breaks into a man\u0027s game like this, let her take her chances like a man. Ain\u0027t that straight?” “You\u0027ve said something,” agreed Jock. “Now, look here, kid. When that door opens I get up. See? And shoot straight for the old man\u0027s office. See? Like a duck. See? Say, I may be fat, kid, but I\u0027m what they call light on my feet, and when I see an order getting away from me I can be so fleet that I have Diana looking like old Weston doing a stretch of muddy country road in a coast to coast hike. See? Now you help me out on this and I\u0027ll see that you don\u0027t suffer for it. I\u0027ll stick in a good word for you, believe me. You take the word of an old stager like me and you won\u0027t go far—” The door opened. Simultaneously three figures sprang into action. Jock had the seat nearest the door. With marvelous clumsiness he managed to place himself in Ed Meyers\u0027 path, then reddened, began an apology, stepped on both of Ed\u0027s feet, jabbed his elbow into his stomach, and dropped his hat. A second later the door of old Sulzberg\u0027s private office closed upon Emma McChesney\u0027s smart, erect, confident figure. Now, Ed Meyers\u0027 hands were peculiar hands for a fat man. They were tapering, slender, delicate, blue-veined, temperamental hands. At this moment, despite his purpling face, and his staring eyes, they were the most noticeable thing about him. His fingers clawed the empty air, quivering, vibrant, as though poised to clutch at Jock\u0027s throat. Then words came. They spluttered from his lips. They popped like corn kernels in the heat of his wrath; they tripped over each other; they exploded. “You darned kid, you!” he began, with fascinating fluency. “You thousand-legged, double-jointed, ox-footed truck horse. Come on out of here and I\u0027ll lick the shine off your shoes, you blue-eyed babe, you! What did you get up for, huh? What did you think this was going to be—a flag drill?” With a whoop of pure joy Jock McChesney turned and fled. They dined together at one o\u0027clock, Emma McChesney and her son Jock. Suddenly Jock stopped eating. His eyes were on the door. “There\u0027s that fathead now,” he said, excitedly. “The nerve of him! He\u0027s coming over here.” Ed Meyers was waddling toward them with the quick light step of the fat man. His pink, full-jowled face was glowing. His eyes were bright as a boy\u0027s. He stopped at their table and paused for one dramatic moment. “So, me beauty, you two were in cahoots, huh? That\u0027s the second low-down deal you\u0027ve handed me. I haven\u0027t forgotten that trick you turned with Nussbaum at DeKalb. Never mind, little girl. I\u0027ll get back at you yet.” He nodded a contemptuous head in Jock\u0027s direction. “Carrying a packer?” {Illustration: “\u0027Come on out of here, and I\u0027ll lick the shine off your shoes, you blue-eyed babe, you!\u0027”} Emma McChesney wiped her fingers daintily on her napkin, crushed it on the table, and leaned back in her chair. “Men,” she observed, wonderingly, “are the cussedest creatures. This chap occupied the same room with you last night and you don\u0027t even know his name. Funny! If two strange women had found themselves occupying the same room for a night they wouldn\u0027t have got to the kimono and back hair stage before they would not only have known each other\u0027s name, but they\u0027d have tried on each other\u0027s hats, swapped corset cover patterns, found mutual friends living in Dayton, Ohio, taught each other a new Irish crochet stitch, showed their family photographs, told how their married sister\u0027s little girl nearly died with swollen glands, and divided off the mirror into two sections to paste their newly washed handkerchiefs on. Don\u0027t tell me men have a genius for friendship.” “Well, who is he?” insisted Ed Meyers. “He told me everything but his name this morning. I wish I had throttled him with a bunch of Bisons\u0027 badges last night.” “His name,” smiled Emma McChesney, “is Jock McChesney. He\u0027s my one and only son, and he\u0027s put through his first little business deal this morning just to show his mother that he can be a help to his folks if he wants to. Now, Ed Meyers, if you\u0027re going to have apoplexy don\u0027t you go and have it around this table. My boy is only on his second piece of pie, and I won\u0027t have his appetite spoiled.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2694/74072.html","bookId":1464,"book":{"id":1464,"title":"Roast Beef, Medium","description":"简介： Seated at Life\u0027s Dining Table, with the Menu of Morals before you, your eye wanders a bit over the entrees, the hors d\u0027oeuvres, and the things a la, though you know that Roast Beef, Medium, is safe, and sane, and sure.
