{"id":38080,"no":6,"title":"V. — PINK TIGHTS AND GINGHAMS","content":"Some one—probably one of those Frenchmen whose life job it was to make epigrams—-once said that there are but two kinds of women: good women, and bad women. Ever since then problem playwrights have been putting that fiction into the mouths of wronged husbands and building their “big scene” around it. But don\u0027t you believe it. There are four kinds: good women, bad women, good bad women, and bad good women. And the worst of these is the last. This should be a story of all four kinds, and when it is finished I defy you to discover which is which. \n \n When the red stuff in the thermometer waxes ambitious, so that fat men stand, bulging-eyed, before it and beginning with the ninety mark count up with a horrible satisfaction—ninety-one—ninety-two—ninety-three—NINETY FOUR! by gosh! and the cinders are filtering into your berth, and even the porter is wandering restlessly up and down the aisle like a black soul in purgatory and a white duck coat, then the thing to do is to don those mercifully few garments which the laxity of sleeping-car etiquette permits, slip out between the green curtains and fare forth in search of draughts, liquid and atmospheric. \n \n At midnight Emma McChesney, inured as she was to sleepers and all their horrors, found her lower eight unbearable. With the bravery of desperation she groped about for her cinder-strewn belongings, donned slippers and kimono, waited until the tortured porter\u0027s footsteps had squeaked their way to the far end of the car, then sped up the dim aisle toward the back platform. She wrenched open the door, felt the rush of air, drew in a long, grateful, smoke-steam-dust laden lungful of it, felt the breath of it on spine and chest, sneezed, realized that she would be the victim of a summer cold next day, and, knowing, cared not. \n \n “Great, ain\u0027t it?” said a voice in the darkness. (Nay, reader. A woman\u0027s voice.) \n \n Emma McChesney was of the non-screaming type. But something inside of her suspended action for the fraction of a second. She peered into the darkness. \n \n “\u0027J\u0027 get scared?” inquired the voice. Its owner lurched forward from the corner in which she had been crouching, into the half-light cast by the vestibule night-globe. \n \n Even as men judge one another by a Masonic emblem, an Elk pin, or the band of a cigar, so do women in sleeping-cars weigh each other according to the rules of the Ancient Order of the Kimono. Seven seconds after Emma McChesney first beheld the negligee that stood revealed in the dim light she had its wearer neatly weighed, marked, listed, docketed and placed. \n \n It was the kind of kimono that is associated with straw-colored hair, and French-heeled shoes, and over-fed dogs at the end of a leash. The Japanese are wrongly accused of having perpetrated it. In pattern it showed bright green flowers-that-never-were sprawling on a purple background. A diamond bar fastened it not too near the throat. \n \n It was one of Emma McChesney\u0027s boasts that she was the only living woman who could get off a sleeper at Bay City, Michigan, at 5 A.M., without looking like a Swedish immigrant just dumped at Ellis Island. Traveling had become a science with her, as witness her serviceable dark-blue silk kimono, and her hair in a schoolgirl braid down her back. The blonde woman cast upon Emma McChesney an admiring eye. \n \n “Gawd, ain\u0027t it hot!” she said, sociably. \n \n “I wonder,” mused Emma McChesney, “if that porter could be hypnotized into making some lemonade—a pitcherful, with a lot of ice in it, and the cold sweat breaking out all over the glass? \n \n “Lemonade!” echoed the other, wonder and amusement in her tone. “Are they still usin\u0027 it?” She leaned against the door, swaying with the motion of the car, and hugging her plump, bare arms. “Travelin\u0027 alone?” she asked. \n \n “Oh, yes,” replied Emma McChesney, and decided it was time to go in. \n \n “Lonesome, ain\u0027t it, without company? Goin\u0027 far?” \n \n “I\u0027m accustomed to it. I travel on business, not pleasure. I\u0027m on the road, representing T. A. Buck\u0027s Featherloom Petticoats!” \n \n The once handsome violet eyes of the plump blonde widened with surprise. Then they narrowed to critical slits. \n \n “On the road! Sellin\u0027 goods! And I thought you was only a kid. It\u0027s the way your hair\u0027s fixed, I suppose. Say, that must be a hard life for a woman—buttin\u0027 into a man\u0027s game like that.” \n \n “Oh, I suppose any work that takes a woman out into the world—” began Emma McChesney vaguely, her hand on the door-knob. \n \n “Sure,” agreed the other. “I ought to know. The hotels and time-tables alone are enough to kill. Who do you suppose makes up train schedules? They don\u0027t seem to think no respectable train ought to leave anywhere before eleven-fifty A.M., or arrive after six A.M. We played Ottumwa, Iowa, last night, and here we are jumpin\u0027 to Illinois.” \n \n In surprise Emma McChesney turned at the door for another look at the hair, figure, complexion and kimono. \n \n “Oh, you\u0027re an actress! Well, if you think mine is a hard life for a woman, why—” \n \n “Me!” said the green-gold blonde, and laughed not prettily. “I ain\u0027t a woman. I\u0027m a queen of burlesque. \n \n “Burlesque? You mean one of those—” Emma McChesney stopped, her usually deft tongue floundering. \n \n “One of those \u0027men only\u0027 troupes? You guessed it. I\u0027m Blanche LeHaye, of the Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles. We get into North Bend at six to-morrow morning, and we play there to-morrow night, Sunday.” She took a step forward so that her haggard face and artificially tinted hair were very near Emma McChesney. “Know what I was thinkin\u0027 just one second before you come out here?” \n \n “No; what?” \n \n “I was thinkin\u0027 what a cinch it would be to just push aside that canvas thing there by the steps and try what the newspaper accounts call \u0027jumping into the night.\u0027 Say, if I\u0027d had on my other lawnjerie I\u0027ll bet I\u0027d have done it.” \n \n Into Emma McChesney\u0027s understanding heart there swept a wave of pity. But she answered lightly: “Is that supposed to be funny?” \n \n The plump blonde yawned. “It depends on your funny bone. Mine\u0027s got blunted. I\u0027m the lady that the Irish comedy guy slaps in the face with a bunch of lettuce. Say, there\u0027s something about you that makes a person get gabby and tell things. You\u0027d make a swell clairvoyant.” \n \n Beneath the comedy of the bleached hair, and the flaccid face, and the bizarre wrapper; behind the coarseness and vulgarity and ignorance, Emma McChesney\u0027s keen mental eye saw something decent and clean and beautiful. And something pitiable, and something tragic. \n \n “I guess you\u0027d better come in and get some sleep,” said Emma McChesney; and somehow found her hand resting on the woman\u0027s shoulder. So they stood, on the swaying, jolting platform. Blanche LeHaye, of the Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles, looked down, askance, at the hand on her shoulder, as at some strange and interesting object. \n \n “Ten years ago,” she said, “that would have started me telling the story of my life, with all the tremolo stops on, and the orchestra in tears. Now it only makes me mad.” \n \n Emma McChesney\u0027s hand seemed to snatch itself away from the woman\u0027s shoulder. \n \n “You can\u0027t treat me with your life\u0027s history. I\u0027m going in.” \n \n “Wait a minute. Don\u0027t go away sore, kid. On the square, I guess I liked the feel of your hand on my arm, like that. Say, I\u0027ve done the same thing myself to a strange dog that looked up at me, pitiful. You know, the way you reach down, and pat \u0027m on the head, and say, \u0027Nice doggie, nice doggie, old fellow,\u0027 even if it is a street cur, with a chawed ear, and no tail. They growl and show their teeth, but they like it. A woman—Lordy! there comes the brakeman. Let\u0027s beat it. Ain\u0027t we the nervy old hens!” \n \n The female of the species as she is found in sleeping-car dressing-rooms had taught Emma McChesney to rise betimes that she might avoid contact with certain frowsy, shapeless beings armed with bottles of milky liquids, and boxes of rosy pastes, and pencils that made arched and inky lines; beings redolent of bitter almond, and violet toilette water; beings in doubtful corsets and green silk petticoats perfect as to accordion-plaited flounce, but showing slits and tatters farther up; beings jealously guarding their ten inches of mirror space and consenting to move for no one; ladies who had come all the way from Texas and who insisted on telling about it, despite a mouthful of hairpins; doubtful sisters who called one dearie and required to be hooked up; distracted mothers with three small children who wiped their hands on your shirt-waist. \n \n {Illustration: “\u0027You can\u0027t treat me with your life\u0027s history. I\u0027m going in\u0027”} \n \n So it was that Emma McChesney, hatted and veiled by 5:45, saw the curtains of the berth opposite rent asunder to disclose the rumpled, shapeless figure of Miss Blanche LeHaye. The queen of burlesque bore in her arms a conglomerate mass of shoes, corset, purple skirt, bag and green-plumed hat. She paused to stare at Emma McChesney\u0027s trim, cool preparedness. \n \n “You must have started to dress as soon\u0027s you come in last night. I never slep\u0027 a wink till just about half a hour ago. I bet I ain\u0027t got more than eleven minutes to dress in. Ain\u0027t this a scorcher!” \n \n When the train stopped at North Bend, Emma McChesney, on her way out, collided with a vision in a pongee duster, rose-colored chiffon veil, chamois gloves, and plumed hat. Miss Blanche LeHaye had made the most of her eleven minutes. Her baggage attended to, Emma McChesney climbed into a hotel \u0027bus. It bore no other passengers. From her corner in the vehicle she could see the queen of burlesque standing in the center of the depot platform, surrounded by her company. It was a tawdry, miserable, almost tragic group, the men undersized, be-diamonded, their skulls oddly shaped, their clothes a satire on the fashions for men, their chins unshaven, their loose lips curved contentedly over cigarettes; the women dreadfully unreal with the pitiless light of the early morning sun glaring down on their bedizened faces, their spotted, garish clothes, their run-down heels, their vivid veils, their matted hair. They were quarreling among themselves, and a flame of hate for the moment lighted up those dull, stupid, vicious faces. Blanche LeHaye appeared to be the center about which the strife waged, for suddenly she flung through the shrill group and walked swiftly over to the \u0027bus and climbed into it heavily. One of the women turned, her face lived beneath the paint, to scream a great oath after her. The \u0027bus driver climbed into his seat and took up the reins. After a moment\u0027s indecision the little group on the platform turned and trailed off down the street, the women sagging under the weight of their bags, the men, for the most part, hurrying on ahead. When the \u0027bus lurched past them the woman who had screamed the oath after Blanche LeHaye laughed shrilly and made a face, like a naughty child, whereupon the others laughed in falsetto chorus. \n \n A touch of real color showed in Blanche LeHaye\u0027s flabby cheek. “I\u0027ll show\u0027m she snarled. That hussy of a Zella Dacre thinkin\u0027 she can get my part away from me the last week or so, the lyin\u0027 sneak. I\u0027ll show\u0027m a leadin\u0027 lady\u0027s a leadin\u0027 lady. Let \u0027em go to their hash hotels. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to the real inn in this town just to let \u0027em know that I got my dignity to keep up, and that I don\u0027t have to mix in with scum like that. You see that there? She pointed at something in the street. Emma McChesney turned to look. The cheap lithographs of the Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles Company glared at one from the bill-boards. \n \n “That\u0027s our paper,” explained Blanche LeHaye. “That\u0027s me, in the center of the bunch, with the pink reins in my hands, drivin\u0027 that four-in-hand of johnnies. Hot stuff! Just let Dacre try to get it away from me, that\u0027s all. I\u0027ll show\u0027m.” \n \n She sank back into her corner. Her anger left her with the suddenness characteristic of her type. \n \n “Ain\u0027t this heat fierce?” she fretted, and closed her eyes. \n \n Now, Emma McChesney was a broad-minded woman. The scars that she had received in her ten years\u0027 battle with business reminded her to be tender at sight of the wounds of others. But now, as she studied the woman huddled there in the corner, she was conscious of a shuddering disgust of her—of the soiled blouse, of the cheap finery, of the sunken places around the jaw-bone, of the swollen places beneath the eyes, of the thin, carmined lips, of the— \n \n Blanche LeHaye opened her eyes suddenly and caught the look on Emma McChesney\u0027s face. Caught it, and comprehended it. Her eyes narrowed, and she laughed shortly. \n \n “Oh, I dunno,” drawled Blanche LeHaye. “I wouldn\u0027t go\u0027s far\u0027s that, kid. Say, when I was your age I didn\u0027t plan to be no bum burlesquer neither. I was going to be an actress, with a farm on Long Island, like the rest of \u0027em. Every real actress has got a farm on Long Island, if it\u0027s only there in the mind of the press agent. It\u0027s a kind of a religion with \u0027em. I was goin\u0027 to build a house on mine that was goin\u0027 to be a cross between a California bungalow and the Horticultural Building at the World\u0027s Fair. Say, I ain\u0027t the worst, kid. There\u0027s others outside of my smear, understand, that I wouldn\u0027t change places with.” \n \n A dozen apologies surged to Emma McChesney\u0027s lips just as the driver drew up at the curbing outside the hotel and jumped down to open the door. She found herself hoping that the hotel clerk would not class her with her companion. \n \n At eleven o\u0027clock that morning Emma McChesney unlocked her door and walked down the red-carpeted hotel corridor. She had had two hours of restful sleep. She had bathed, and breakfasted, and donned clean clothes. She had brushed the cinders out of her hair, and manicured. She felt as alert, and cool and refreshed as she looked, which speaks well for her comfort. \n \n Halfway down the hail a bedroom door stood open. Emma McChesney glanced in. What she saw made her stop. The next moment she would have hurried on, but the figure within called out to her. \n \n Miss Blanche LeHaye had got into her kimono again. She was slumped in a dejected heap in a chair before the window. There was a tray, with a bottle and some glasses on the table by her side. \n \n “Gawd, ain\u0027t it hot!” she whined miserably. “Come on in a minute. I left the door open to catch the breeze, but there ain\u0027t any. You look like a peach just off the ice. Got a gent friend in town?” \n \n “No,” answered Emma McChesney hurriedly, and turned to go. \n \n “Wait a minute,” said Blanche LeHaye, sharply, and rose. She slouched over to where Emma McChesney stood and looked up at her sullenly. \n \n “Why!” gasped Emma McChesney, and involuntarily put out her hand, “why—my dear—you\u0027ve been crying! Is there—” \n \n “No, there ain\u0027t. I can bawl, can\u0027t I, if I am a bum burlesquer?” She put down the squat little glass she had in her hand and stared resentfully at Emma McChesney\u0027s cool, fragrant freshness. \n \n “Say,” she demanded suddenly, “whatja mean by lookin\u0027 at me the way you did this morning, h\u0027m? Whatja mean? You got a nerve turnin\u0027 up your nose at me, you have. I\u0027ll just bet you ain\u0027t no better than you might be, neither. What the—” \n \n Swiftly Emma McChesney crossed the room and closed the door. Then she came back to where Blanche LeHaye stood. \n \n “Now listen to me,” she said. “You shed that purple kimono of yours and hustle into some clothes and come along with me. I mean it. Whenever I\u0027m anywhere near this town I make a jump and Sunday here. I\u0027ve a friend here named Morrissey—Ethel Morrissey—and she\u0027s the biggest-hearted, most understanding friend that a woman ever had. She\u0027s skirt and suit buyer at Barker \u0026 Fisk\u0027s here. I have a standing invitation to spend Sunday at her house. She knows I\u0027m coming. I help get dinner if I feel like it, and wash my hair if I want to, and sit out in the back yard, and fool with the dog, and act like a human being for one day. After you\u0027ve been on the road for ten years a real Sunday dinner in a real home has got Sherry\u0027s flossiest efforts looking like a picnic collation with ants in the pie. You\u0027re coming with me, more for my sake than for yours, because the thought of you sitting here, like this, would sour the day for me.” \n \n Blanche LeHaye\u0027s fingers were picking at the pin which fastened her gown. She smiled, uncertainly. \n \n “What\u0027s your game?” she inquired. \n \n “I\u0027ll wait for you downstairs,” said Emma McChesney, pleasantly. “Do you ever have any luck with caramel icing? Ethel\u0027s and mine always curdles.” \n \n “Do I?” yelled the queen of burlesque. “I invented it.” And she was down on her knees, her fingers fumbling with the lock of her suitcase. \n \n Only an Ethel Morrissey, inured to the weird workings of humanity by years of shrewd skirt and suit buying, could have stood the test of having a Blanche LeHaye thrust upon her, an unexpected guest, and with the woman across the street sitting on her front porch taking it all in. \n \n At the door—“This is Miss Blanche LeHaye of the—er—Simon—” \n \n “Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles,” put in Miss LeHaye. “Pleased to meet you.” \n \n “Come in,” said Miss Ethel Morrissey without batting an eye. “I just \u0027phoned the hotel. Thought you\u0027d gone back on me, Emma. I\u0027m baking a caramel cake. Don\u0027t slam the door. This your first visit here, Miss LeHaye? Excuse me for not shaking hands. I\u0027m all flour. Lay your things in there. Ma\u0027s spending the day with Aunt Gus at Forest City and I\u0027m the whole works around here. It\u0027s got skirts and suits beat a mile. Hot, ain\u0027t it? Say, suppose you girls slip off your waists and I\u0027ll give you each an all-over apron that\u0027s loose and let\u0027s the breeze slide around.” \n \n Blanche LeHaye, the garrulous, was strangely silent. When she stepped about it was in the manner of one who is fearful of wakening a sleeper. When she caught the eyes of either of the other women her own glance dropped. \n \n When Ethel Morrissey came in with the blue-and-white gingham aprons Blanche LeHaye hesitated a long minute before picking hers up. Then she held it by both sleeves and looked at it long, and curiously. When she looked up again she found the eyes of the other two upon her. She slipped the apron over her head with a nervous little laugh. \n \n “I\u0027ve been a pair of pink tights so long,” she said, “that I guess I\u0027ve almost forgotten how to be a woman. But once I get this on I\u0027ll bet I can come back.” \n \n She proved it from the moment that she measured out the first cupful of brown sugar for the caramel icing. She shed her rings, and pinned her hair back from her forehead, and tucked up her sleeves, and as Emma McChesney watched her a resolve grew in her mind. \n \n The cake disposed of—“Give me some potatoes to peel, will you?” said Blanche LeHaye, suddenly. “Give \u0027em to me in a brown crock, with a chip out of the side. There\u0027s certain things always goes hand-in-hand in your mind. You can\u0027t think of one without the other. Now, Lillian Russell and cold cream is one; and new potatoes and brown crocks is another.” \n \n {Illustration: “\u0027Now, Lillian Russell and cold cream is one; and new potatoes and brown crocks is another\u0027”} \n \n She peeled potatoes, sitting hunched up on the kitchen chair with her high heels caught back of the top rung. She chopped spinach until her face was scarlet, and her hair hung in limp strands at the back of her neck. She skinned tomatoes. She scoured pans. She wiped up the white oilcloth table-top with a capable and soapy hand. The heat and bustle of the little kitchen seemed to work some miraculous change in her. Her eyes brightened. Her lips smiled. Once, Emma McChesney and Ethel Morrissey exchanged covert looks when they heard her crooning one of those tuneless chants that women hum when they wring out dishcloths in soapy water. \n \n After dinner, in the cool of the sitting-room, with the shades drawn, and their skirts tucked halfway to their knees, things looked propitious for that first stroke in the plan which had worked itself out in Emma McChesney\u0027s alert mind. She caught Blanche LeHaye\u0027s eye, and smiled. \n \n “This beats burlesquing, doesn\u0027t it?” she said. She leaned forward a bit in her chair. “Tell me, Miss LeHaye, haven\u0027t you ever thought of quitting that—the stage—and turning to something—something—” \n \n “Something decent?” Blanche LeHaye finished for her. “I used to. I\u0027ve got over that. Now all I ask is to get a laugh when I kick the comedian\u0027s hat off with my toe.” \n \n “But there must have been a time—” insinuated Emma McChesney, gently. \n \n Blanche LeHaye grinned broadly at the two women who were watching her so intently. \n \n “I think I ought to tell you,” she began, “that I never was a minister\u0027s daughter, and I don\u0027t remember ever havin\u0027 been deserted by my sweetheart when I was young and trusting. If I was to draw a picture of my life it would look like one of those charts that the weather bureau gets out—one of those high and low barometer things, all uphill and downhill like a chain of mountains in a kid\u0027s geography.” \n \n She shut her eyes and lay back in the depths of the leather-cushioned chair. The three sat in silence for a moment. \n \n “Look here,” said Emma McChesney, suddenly, rising and coming over to the woman in the big chair, “that\u0027s not the life for a woman like you. I can get you a place in our office—not much, perhaps, but something decent—something to start with. If you—” \n \n “For that matter,” put in Ethel Morrissey, quickly, “I could get you something right here in our store. I\u0027ve been there long enough to have some say-so, and if I recommend you they\u0027d start you in the basement at first, and then, if you made good, they advance you right along.” \n \n Blanche LeHaye stood up and, twisting her arm around at the back, began to unbutton her gingham apron. \n \n “I guess you think I\u0027m a bad one, don\u0027t you? Well, maybe I am. But I\u0027m not the worst. I\u0027ve got a brother. He lives out West, and he\u0027s rich, and married, and respectable. You know the way a man can climb out of the mud, while a woman just can\u0027t wade out of it? Well, that\u0027s the way it was with us. His wife\u0027s a regular society bug. She wouldn\u0027t admit that there was any such truck as me, unless, maybe, the Municipal Protective League, or something, of her town, got to waging a war against burlesque shows. I hadn\u0027t seen Len—that\u0027s my brother—-in years and years. Then one night in Omaha, I glimmed him sitting down in the B. H. row. His face just seemed to rise up at me out of the audience. He recognized me, too. Say, men are all alike. What they see in a dingy, half-fed, ignorant bunch like us, I don\u0027t know. But the minute a man goes to Cleveland, or Pittsburgh, or somewhere on business he\u0027ll hunt up a burlesque show, and what\u0027s more, he\u0027ll enjoy it. Funny. Well, Len waited for me after the show, and we had a talk. He told me his troubles, and I told him some of mine, and when we got through I wouldn\u0027t have swapped with him. His wife\u0027s a wonder. She\u0027s climbed to the top of the ladder in her town. And she\u0027s pretty, and young-looking, and a regular swell. Len says their home is one of the kind where the rubberneck auto stops while the spieler tells the crowd who lives there, and how he made his money. But they haven\u0027t any kids, Len told me. He\u0027s crazy about \u0027em. But his wife don\u0027t want any. I wish you could have seen Len\u0027s face when he was talking about it.” \n \n She dropped the gingham apron in a circle at her feet, and stepped out of it. She walked over to where her own clothes lay in a gaudy heap. \n \n “Exit the gingham. But it\u0027s been great.” She paused before slipping her skirt over her head. The silence of the other two women seemed to anger her a little. \n \n {Illustration: \u0027“Why, girls, I couldn\u0027t hold down a job in a candy factory\u0027”} \n \n “I guess you think I\u0027m a bad one, clear through, don\u0027t you? Well, I ain\u0027t. I don\u0027t hurt anybody but myself. Len\u0027s wife—that\u0027s what I call bad.” \n \n “But I don\u0027t think you\u0027re bad clear through,” tried Emma McChesney. “I don\u0027t. That\u0027s why I made that proposition to you. That\u0027s why I want you to get away from all this, and start over again.” \n \n “Me?” laughed Blanche LeHaye. “Me! In a office! With ledgers, and sale bills, and accounts, and all that stuff! Why, girls, I couldn\u0027t hold down a job in a candy factory. I ain\u0027t got any intelligence. I never had. You don\u0027t find women with brains in a burlesque troupe. If they had \u0027em they wouldn\u0027t be there. Why, we\u0027re the dumbest, most ignorant bunch there is. Most of us are just hired girls, dressed up. That\u0027s why you find the Woman\u0027s Uplift union having such a blamed hard time savin\u0027 souls. The souls they try to save know just enough to be wise to the fact that they couldn\u0027t hold down a five-per-week job. Don\u0027t you feel sorry for me. I\u0027m doing the only thing I\u0027m good for.” \n \n Emma McChesney put out her hand. “I\u0027m sorry,” she said. “I only meant it for—” \n \n “Why, of course,” agreed Blanche LeHaye, heartily. “And you, too.” She turned so that her broad, good-natured smile included Ethel Morrissey. “I\u0027ve had a whale of a time. My fingers are all stained up with new potatoes, and my nails is full of strawberry juice, and I hope it won\u0027t come off for a week. And I want to thank you both. I\u0027d like to stay, but I\u0027m going to hump over to the theater. That Dacre\u0027s got the nerve to swipe the star\u0027s dressing-room if I don\u0027t get my trunks in first.” \n \n They walked with her to the front porch, making talk as they went. Resentment and discomfiture and a sort of admiration all played across the faces of the two women, whose kindness had met with rebuff.
