{"id":38081,"no":7,"title":"VI. — SIMPLY SKIRTS","content":"They may differ on the subjects of cigars, samples, hotels, ball teams and pinochle hands, but two things there are upon which they stand united. Every member of that fraternity which is condemned to a hotel bedroom, or a sleeper berth by night, and chained to a sample case by day agrees in this, first: That it isn\u0027t what it used to be. Second: If only they could find an opening for a nice, paying gents\u0027 furnishing business in a live little town that wasn\u0027t swamped with that kind of thing already they\u0027d buy it and settle down like a white man, by George! and quit this peddling. The missus hates it anyhow; and the kids know the iceman better than they do their own dad. On the morning that Mrs. Emma McChesney (representing T. A. Buck, Featherloom Petticoats) finished her talk with Miss Hattie Stitch, head of Kiser \u0026 Bloch\u0027s skirt and suit department, she found herself in a rare mood. She hated her job; she loathed her yellow sample cases; she longed to call Miss Stitch a green-eyed cat; and she wished that she had chosen some easy and pleasant way of earning a living, like doing plain and fancy washing and ironing. Emma McChesney had been selling Featherloom Petticoats on the road for almost ten years, and she was famed throughout her territory for her sane sunniness, and her love of her work. Which speaks badly for Miss Hattie Stitch. Miss Hattie Stitch hated Emma McChesney with all the hate that a flat-chested, thin-haired woman has for one who can wear a large thirty-six without one inch of alteration, and a hat that turns sharply away from the face. For forty-six weeks in the year Miss Stitch existed in Kiser \u0026 Bloch\u0027s store at River Falls. For six weeks, two in spring, two in fall, and two in mid-winter, Hattie lived in New York, with a capital L. She went there to select the season\u0027s newest models (slightly modified for River Falls), but incidentally she took a regular trousseau with her. All day long Hattie picked skirt and suit models with unerring good taste and business judgment. At night she was a creature transformed. Every house of which Hattie bought did its duty like a soldier and a gentleman. Nightly Hattie powdered her neck and arms, performed sacred rites over her hair and nails, donned a gown so complicated that a hotel maid had to hook her up the back, and was ready for her evening\u0027s escort at eight. There wasn\u0027t a hat in a grill room from one end of the Crooked Cow-path to the other that was more wildly barbaric than Hattie\u0027s, even in these sane and simple days when the bird of paradise has become the national bird. The buyer of suits for a thriving department store in a hustling little Middle-Western town isn\u0027t to be neglected. Whenever a show came to River Falls Hattie would look bored, pass a weary hand over her glossy coiffure and say: “Oh, yes. Clever little show. Saw it two winters ago in New York. This won\u0027t be the original company, of course.” The year that Hattie came back wearing a set of skunk everyone thought it was lynx until Hattie drew attention to what she called the “brown tone” in it. After that Old Lady Heinz got her old skunk furs out of the moth balls and tobacco and newspapers that had preserved them, and her daughter cut them up into bands for the bottom of her skirt, and the cuffs of her coat. When Kiser \u0026 Bloch had their fall and spring openings the town came ostensibly to see the new styles, but really to gaze at Hattie in a new confection, undulating up and down the department, talking with a heavy Eastern accent about this or that being “smart” or “good this year,” or having “a world of style,” and sort of trailing her toes after her to give a clinging, Grecian line, like pictures of Ethel Barrymore when she was thin. The year that Hattie confided to some one that she was wearing only scant bloomers beneath her slinky silk the floor was mobbed, and they had to call in reserves from the basement ladies-and-misses-ready-to-wear. Miss Stitch came to New York in March. On the evening of her arrival she dined with Fat Ed Meyers, of the Strauss Sans-silk Skirt Company. He informed her that she looked like a kid, and that that was some classy little gown, and it wasn\u0027t every woman who could wear that kind of thing and get away with it. It took a certain style. Hattie smiled, and hummed off-key to the tune the orchestra was playing, and Ed told her it was a shame she didn\u0027t do something with that voice. “I have something to tell you,” said Hattie. “Just before I left I had a talk with old Kiser. Or rather, he had a talk with me. You know I have pretty much my own way in my department. Pity if I couldn\u0027t have. I made it. Well, Kiser wanted to know why I didn\u0027t buy Featherlooms. I said we had no call for \u0027em, and he came back with figures to prove we\u0027re losing a good many hundreds a year by not carrying them. He said the Strauss Sans-silk skirt isn\u0027t what it used to be. And he\u0027s right.” “Oh, say—” objected Ed Meyers. “It\u0027s true,” insisted Hattie. “But I couldn\u0027t tell him that I didn\u0027t buy Featherlooms because McChesney made me tired. Besides, she never entertains me when I\u0027m in New York. Not that I\u0027d go to the theater in the evening with a woman, because I wouldn\u0027t, but—Say, listen. Why don\u0027t you make a play for her job? As long as I\u0027ve got to put in a heavy line of Featherlooms you may as well get the benefit of it. You could double your commissions. I\u0027ll bet that woman makes her I-don\u0027t know-how-many thousands a year.” Ed Meyers\u0027 naturally ruddy complexion took on a richer tone, and he dropped his fork hastily. As he gazed at Miss Stitch his glance was not more than half flattering. “How you women do love each other, don\u0027t you! You don\u0027t. I don\u0027t mind telling you my firm\u0027s cutting down its road force, and none of us knows who\u0027s going to be beheaded next. But—well—a guy wouldn\u0027t want to take a job away from a woman—especially a square little trick like McChesney. Of course she\u0027s played me a couple of low-down deals and I promised to get back at her, but that\u0027s business. But—” “So\u0027s this,” interrupted Miss Hattie Stitch. “And I don\u0027t know that she is so square. Let me tell you that I heard she\u0027s no better than she might be. I have it on good authority that three weeks ago, at the River House, in our town—” Their heads came close together over the little, rose-shaded restaurant table. At eleven o\u0027clock next morning Fat Ed Meyers walked into the office of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company and asked to see old T. A. “He\u0027s in Europe,” a stenographer informed him, “spaing, and sprudeling, and badening. Want to see T. A. Junior?” “T. A. Junior!” almost shouted Ed Meyers. “You don\u0027t mean to tell me that fellow\u0027s taken hold—” “Believe me. That\u0027s why Featherlooms are soaring and Sans-silks are sinking. Nobody would have believed it. T. A. Junior\u0027s got a live wire looking like a stick of licorice. When they thought old T. A. was going to die, young T. A. seemed to straighten out all of a sudden and take hold. It\u0027s about time. He must be almost forty, but he don\u0027t show it. I don\u0027t know, he ain\u0027t so good-looking, but he\u0027s got swell eyes.” Ed Meyers turned the knob of the door marked “Private,” and entered, smiling. Ed Meyers had a smile so cherubic that involuntarily you armed yourself against it. “Hel-lo Buck!” he called jovially. “I hear that at last you\u0027re taking an interest in skirts—other than on the hoof.” And he offered young T. A. a large, dark cigar with a fussy-looking band encircling its middle. Young T. A. looked at it disinterestedly, and spake, saying: “What are you after?” “Why, I just dropped in—” began Ed Meyers lamely. “The dropping,” observed T. A. Junior, “is bad around here this morning. I have one little formula for all visitors to-day, regardless of whether they\u0027re book agents or skirt salesmen. That is, what can I do for you?” Ed Meyers tucked his cigar neatly into the extreme right corner of his mouth, pushed his brown derby far back on his head, rested his strangely lean hands on his plump knees, and fixed T. A. Junior with a shrewd blue eye. “That suits me fine,” he agreed. “I never was one to beat around the bush. Look here. I know skirts from the draw-string to the ruffle. It\u0027s a woman\u0027s garment, but a man\u0027s line. There\u0027s fifty reasons why a woman can\u0027t handle it like a man. For one thing the packing cases weigh twenty-five pounds each, and she\u0027s as dependent on a packer and a porter as a baby is on its mother. Another is that if a man has to get up to make a train at 4 A.M. he don\u0027t require twenty-five minutes to fasten down three sets of garters, and braid his hair, and hook his waist up the back, and miss his train. And he don\u0027t have neuralgic headaches. Then, the head of a skirt department in a store is a woman, ten times out of ten. And lemme tell you,” he leaned forward earnestly, “a woman don\u0027t like to buy of a woman. Don\u0027t ask me why. I\u0027m too modest. But it\u0027s the truth.” “Well?” said young T. A., with the rising inflection. “Well,” finished Ed Meyers, “I like your stuff. I think it\u0027s great. It\u0027s a seller, with the right man to push it. I\u0027d like to handle it. And I\u0027ll guarantee I could double the returns from your Middle-Western territory.” T. A. Junior had strangely translucent eyes. Their luminous quality had an odd effect upon any one on whom he happened to turn them. He had been scrawling meaningless curlycues on a piece of paper as Ed Meyers talked. Now he put down the pencil, turned, and looked Ed Meyers fairly in the eye. “You mean you want Mrs. McChesney\u0027s territory?” he asked quietly. “Well, yes, I do,” confessed Ed Meyers, without a blush. Young T. A. swung back to his desk, tore from the pad before him the piece of paper on which he had been scrawling, crushed it, and tossed it into the wastebasket with an air of finality. “Take the second elevator down,” he said. “The nearest one\u0027s out of order.” For a moment Ed Meyers stared, his fat face purpling. “Oh, very well,” he said, rising. “I just made you a business proposition, that\u0027s all. I thought I was talking to a business man. Now, old T. A.—” “That\u0027ll be about all,” observed T. A. Junior, from his desk. Ed Meyers started toward the door. Then he paused, turned, and came back to his chair. His heavy jaw jutted out threateningly. “No, it ain\u0027t all, either. I didn\u0027t want to mention it, and if you\u0027d treated me like a gentleman, I wouldn\u0027t have. But I want to say to you that McChesney\u0027s giving this firm a black eye. Morals don\u0027t figure with a man on the road, but when a woman breaks into this game, she\u0027s got to be on the level.” T. A. Junior rose. The blonde stenographer who had made the admiring remark anent his eyes would have appreciated those features now. They glowed luminously into Ed Meyers\u0027 pale blue ones until that gentleman dropped his eyelids in confusion. He seemed at a disadvantage in every way, as T. A. Junior\u0027s lean, graceful height towered over the fat man\u0027s bulk. “I don\u0027t know Mrs. McChesney,” said T. A. Junior. “I haven\u0027t even seen her in six years. My interest in the business is very recent. I do know that my father swears she\u0027s the best salesman he has on the road. Before you go any further I want to tell you that you\u0027ll have to prove what you just implied, so definitely, and conclusively, and convincingly that when you finish you\u0027ll have an ordinary engineering blue-print looking like a Turner landscape. Begin.” Ed Meyers, still standing, clutched his derby tightly and began. “She\u0027s a looker, Emma is. And smooth! As the top of your desk. But she\u0027s getting careless. Now a decent, hard-working, straight girl like Miss Hattie Stitch, of Kiser \u0026 Bloch\u0027s, River Falls, won\u0027t buy of her. You\u0027ll find you don\u0027t sell that firm. And they buy big, too. Why, last summer I had it from the clerk of the hotel in that town that she ran around all day with a woman named LeHaye—Blanche LeHaye, of an aggregation of bum burlesquers called the Sam Levin Crackerjack Belles. And say, for a whole month there, she had a tough young kid traveling with her that she called her son. Oh, she\u0027s queering your line, all right. The days are past when it used to be a signal for a loud, merry laugh if you mentioned you were selling goods on the road. It\u0027s a fine art, and a science these days, and the name of T. A. Buck has always stood for—” Downstairs a trim, well-dressed, attractive woman stepped into the elevator and smiled radiantly upon the elevator man, who had smiled first. “Hello, Jake,” she said. “What\u0027s old in New York? I haven\u0027t been here in three months. It\u0027s good to be back.” “Seems grand t\u0027 see you, Mis\u0027 McChesney,” returned Jake. “Well, nothin\u0027 much stirrin\u0027. Whatcha think of the Grand Central? I understand they\u0027re going to have a contrivance so you can stand on a mat in the waiting-room and wish yourself down to the track an\u0027 train that you\u0027re leavin\u0027 on. The G\u0027ints have picked a bunch of shines this season. T. A. Junior\u0027s got a new sixty-power auto. Genevieve—that yella-headed steno—was married last month to Henry, the shipping clerk. My wife presented me with twin girls Monday. Well, thank you, Mrs. McChesney. I guess that\u0027ll help some.” Emma McChesney swung down the hall and into the big, bright office. She paused at the head bookkeeper\u0027s desk. The head bookkeeper was a woman. Old Man Buck had learned something about the faithfulness of women employees. The head bookkeeper looked up and said some convincing things. “Thanks,” said Emma, in return. “It\u0027s mighty good to be here. Is it true that skirts are going to be full in the back? How\u0027s business? T. A. in?” “Young T. A. is. But I think he\u0027s busy just now. You know T. A. Senior isn\u0027t back yet. He had a tight squeeze, I guess. Everybody\u0027s talking about the way young T. A. took hold. You know he spent years running around Europe, and he made a specialty of first nights, and first editions, and French cars when he did show up here. But now! He\u0027s changed the advertising, and designing, and cutting departments around here until there\u0027s as much difference between this place now and the place it was three months ago as there is between a hoop-skirt and a hobble. He designed one skirt—Here, Miss Kelly! Just go in and get one of those embroidery flounce models for Mrs. McChesney. How\u0027s that? Honestly, I\u0027d wear it myself.” Emma McChesney held the garment in her two hands and looked it over critically. Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully. She looked up to reply when the door of T. A. Buck\u0027s private office opened, and Ed Meyers walked briskly out. Emma McChesney put down the skirt and crossed the office so that she and he met just in front of the little gate that formed an entrance along the railing. Ed Meyers\u0027 mouth twisted itself into a smile. He put out a welcoming hand. “Why, hello, stranger! When did you drive in? How\u0027s every little thing? I\u0027m darned if you don\u0027t grow prettier and younger every day of your sweet life.” “Quit Sans-silks?” inquired Mrs. McChesney briefly. {Illustration: “\u0027Honestly. I\u0027d wear it myself!\u0027”} “Why—no. But I was just telling young T. A. in there that if I could only find a nice, paying little gents\u0027 furnishing business in a live little town that wasn\u0027t swamped with that kind of thing already I\u0027d buy it, by George! I\u0027m tired of this peddling.” “Sing that,” said Emma McChesney. “It might sound better,” and marched into the office marked “Private.” T. A. Junior\u0027s good-looking back and semi-bald head were toward her as she entered. She noted, approvingly, woman-fashion, that his neck would never lap over the edge of his collar in the back. Then Young T. A. turned about. He gazed at Emma McChesney, his eyebrows raised inquiringly. Emma McChesney\u0027s honest blue eyes, with no translucent nonsense about them, gazed straight back at T. A. Junior. “I\u0027m Mrs. McChesney. I got in half an hour ago. It\u0027s been a good little trip, considering business, and politics, and all that. I\u0027m sorry to hear your father\u0027s still ill. He and I always talked over things after my long trip.” Young T. A.\u0027s expert eye did not miss a single point, from the tip of Mrs. McChesney\u0027s smart spring hat to the toes of her well-shod feet, with full stops for the fit of her tailored suit, the freshness of her gloves, the clearness of her healthy pink skin, the wave of her soft, bright hair. “How do you do, Mrs. McChesney,” said Young T. A. emphatically. “Please sit down. It\u0027s a good idea—this talking over your trip. There are several little things—now Kiser \u0026 Bloch, of River Falls, for instance. We ought to be selling them. The head of their skirt and suit department is named Stitch, isn\u0027t she? Now, what would you say of Miss Stitch?” “Say?” repeated Emma McChesney quickly. “As a woman, or a buyer?” T. A. Junior thought a minute. “As a woman.” Mrs. McChesney thoughtfully regarded the tips of her neatly gloved hands. Then she looked up. “The kindest and gentlest thing I can say about her is that if she\u0027d let her hair grow out gray maybe her face wouldn\u0027t look so hard.” T. A. Junior flung himself back in his chair and threw back his head and laughed at the ceiling. Then, “How old is your son?” with disconcerting suddenness. “Jock\u0027s scandalously near eighteen.” In her quick mind Emma McChesney was piecing odds and ends together, and shaping the whole to fit Fat Ed Meyers. A little righteous anger was rising within her. T. A. Junior searched her face with his glowing eyes. “Does my father know that you have a young man son? Queer you never mentioned it. “Queer? Maybe. Also, I don\u0027t remember ever having mentioned what church my folks belonged to, or where I was born, or whether I like my steak rare or medium, or what my maiden name was, or the size of my shoes, or whether I take my coffee with or without. That\u0027s because I don\u0027t believe in dragging private and family affairs into the business relation. I think I ought to tell you that on the way in I met Ed Meyers, of the Strauss Sans-silk Skirt Company, coming out. So anything you say won\u0027t surprise me.” “You wouldn\u0027t be surprised,” asked T. A. Junior smoothly, “if I were to say that I\u0027m considering giving a man your territory?” Emma McChesney\u0027s eyes—those eyes that had seen so much of the world and its ways, and that still could return your gaze so clearly and honestly—widened until they looked so much like those of a hurt child, or a dumb animal that has received a death wound, that young T. A. dropped his gaze in confusion. Emma McChesney stood up. Her breath came a little quickly. But when she spoke, her voice was low and almost steady. “If you expect me to beg you for my job, you\u0027re mistaken. T. A. Buck\u0027s Featherloom Petticoats have been my existence for almost ten years. I\u0027ve sold Featherlooms six days in the week, and seven when I had a Sunday customer. They\u0027ve not only been my business and my means of earning a livelihood, they\u0027ve been my religion, my diversion, my life, my pet pastime. I\u0027ve lived petticoats, I\u0027ve talked petticoats, I\u0027ve sold petticoats, I\u0027ve dreamed petticoats—why, I\u0027ve even worn the darned things! And that\u0027s more than any man will ever do for you.” {Illustration: “\u0027I\u0027ve lived petticoats, I\u0027ve talked petticoats, I\u0027ve dreamed petticoats—why, I\u0027ve even worn the darn things!\u0027”} Young T. A. rose. He laughed a little laugh of sheer admiration. Admiration shone, too, in those eyes of his which so many women found irresistible. He took a step forward and laid one well-shaped hand on Emma McChesney\u0027s arm. She did not shrink, so he let his hand slip down the neat blue serge sleeve until it reached her snugly gloved hand. “You\u0027re all right!” he said. His voice was very low, and there was a new note in it. “Listen, girlie. I\u0027ve just bought a new sixty-power machine. Have dinner with me to-night, will you? And we\u0027ll take a run out in the country somewhere. It\u0027s warm, even for March. I\u0027ll bring along a fur coat for you. H\u0027m?” Mrs. McChesney stood thoughtfully regarding the hand that covered her own. The blue of her eyes and the pink of her cheeks were a marvel to behold. “It\u0027s a shame,” she began slowly, “that you\u0027re not twenty-five years younger, so that your father could give you the licking you deserve when he comes home. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if he\u0027d do it anyway. The Lord preserve me from these quiet, deep devils with temperamental hands and luminous eyes. Give me one of the bull-necked, red-faced, hoarse-voiced, fresh kind every time. You know what they\u0027re going to say, at least, and you\u0027re prepared for them. If I were to tell you how the hand you\u0027re holding is tingling to box your ears you\u0027d marvel that any human being could have that much repression and live. I\u0027ve heard of this kind of thing, but I didn\u0027t know it happened often off the stage and outside of novels. Let\u0027s get down to cases. If I let you make love to me, I keep my job. Is that it?” “Why—no—I—to tell the truth I was only—” “Don\u0027t embarrass yourself. I just want to tell you that before I\u0027d accept your auto ride I\u0027d open a little fancy art goods and needlework store in Menominee, Michigan, and get out the newest things in Hardanger work and Egyptian embroidery. And that\u0027s my notion of zero in occupation. Besides, no plain, everyday workingwoman could enjoy herself in your car because her conscience wouldn\u0027t let her. She\u0027d be thinking all the time how she was depriving some poor, hard-working chorus girl of her legitimate pastime, and that would spoil everything. The elevator man told me that you had a new motor car, but the news didn\u0027t interest me half as much as that of his having new twin girls. Anything with five thousand dollars can have a sixty-power machine, but only an elevator man on eight dollars a week can afford the luxury of twins.” “My dear Mrs. McChesney—” “Don\u0027t,” said Emma McChesney sharply. “I couldn\u0027t stand much more. I joke, you know, when other women cry. It isn\u0027t so wearing.” She turned abruptly and walked toward the door. T. A. Junior overtook her in three long strides, and placed himself directly before her. “My cue,” said Emma McChesney, with a weary brightness, “to say, \u0027Let me pass, sir!\u0027” “Please don\u0027t,” pleaded T. A. Junior. “I\u0027ll remember this the rest of my life. I thought I was a statue of modern business methods, but after to-day I\u0027m going to ask the office boy to help me run this thing. If I could only think of some special way to apologize to you—” “Oh, it\u0027s all right,” said Emma McChesney indifferently. “But it isn\u0027t! It isn\u0027t! You don\u0027t understand. That human jellyfish of a Meyers said some things, and I thought I\u0027d be clever and prove them. I can\u0027t ask your pardon. There aren\u0027t words enough in the language. Why, you\u0027re the finest little woman—you\u0027re—you\u0027d restore the faith of a cynic who had chronic indigestion. I wish I—Say, let me relieve you of a couple of those small towns that you hate to make, and give you Cleveland and Cincinnati. And let me—Why say, Mrs. McChesney! Please! Don\u0027t! This isn\u0027t the time to—” “I can\u0027t help it,” sobbed Emma McChesney, her two hands before her face. “I\u0027ll stop in a minute. There; I\u0027m stopping now. For Heaven\u0027s sake, stop patting me on the head!” “Please don\u0027t be so decent to me,” entreated T. A. Junior, his fine eyes more luminous than ever. “If only you\u0027d try to get back at me I wouldn\u0027t feel so cut up about it.” Emma McChesney looked up at him, a smile shining radiantly through the tears. “Very well. I\u0027ll do it. Just before I came in they showed me that new embroidery flounced model you just designed. Maybe you don\u0027t know it, but women wear only one limp petticoat nowadays. And buttoned shoes. The eyelets in that embroidery are just big enough to catch on the top button of a woman\u0027s shoe, and tear, and trip her. I ought to have let you make up a couple of million of them, and then watch them come back on your hands. I was going to tell you, anyway, for T. A. Senior\u0027s sake. Now I\u0027m doing it for your own.” {Illustration: “And found himself addressing the backs of the letters on the door marked \u0027Private\u0027”} “For—” began T. A. Junior excitedly. And found himself addressing the backs of the letters on the door marked “Private,” as it slammed after the trim, erect figure in blue.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2694/74074.html","bookId":1464,"book":{"id":1464,"title":"Roast Beef, Medium","description":"简介： Seated at Life\u0027s Dining Table, with the Menu of Morals before you, your eye wanders a bit over the entrees, the hors d\u0027oeuvres, and the things a la, though you know that Roast Beef, Medium, is safe, and sane, and sure.
