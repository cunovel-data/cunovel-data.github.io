{"id":15437,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. MR. MOLLETT RETURNS TO SOUTH MAIN STREET.","content":"I must now take my readers back to that very unsavoury public-house in South Main Street, Cork, in which, for the present, lived Mr. Matthew Mollett and his son Abraham. \\n\\n \\n\\n I need hardly explain to a discerning public that Mr. Matthew Mollett was the gentleman who made that momentous call at Castle Richmond, and flurried all that household. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Drat it!\" said Mrs. Jones to herself on that day, as soon as she had regained the solitude of her own private apartment, after having taken a long look at Mr. Mollett in the hall. On that occasion she sat down on a low chair in the middle of the room, put her two hands down substantially on her two knees, gave a long sigh, and then made the above exclamation,—\"Drat it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jones was still thoroughly a Saxon, although she had lived for so many years among the Celts. But it was only when she was quite alone that she allowed herself the indulgence of so peculiarly Saxon a mode of expressing either her surprise or indignation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the same man,\" she said to herself, \"as come that day, as sure as eggs;\" and then for five minutes she maintained her position, cogitating. \"And he\u0027s like the other fellow too,\" she continued. \"Only, somehow he\u0027s not like him.\" And then another pause. \"And yet he is; only it can\u0027t be; and he ain\u0027t just so tall, and he\u0027s older like.\" And then, still meditating, Mrs. Jones kept her position for full ten minutes longer; at the end of which time she got up and shook herself. She deserved to be bracketed with Lord Brougham and Professor Faraday, for she had kept her mind intent on her subject, and had come to a resolution. \"I won\u0027t say nothing to nobody, noways,\" was the expression of her mind\u0027s purpose. \"Only I\u0027ll tell missus as how he was the man as come to Wales.\" And she did tell so much to her mistress—as we have before learned. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Mollett had gone down from Cork to Castle Richmond in one of those delightful Irish vehicles called a covered car. An inside-covered car is an equipage much given to shaking, seeing that it has a heavy top like a London cab, and that it runs on a pair of wheels. It is entered from behind, and slopes backwards. The sitter sits sideways, between a cracked window on one side and a cracked doorway on the other; and as a draught is always going in at the ear next the window, and out at the ear next the door, it is about as cold and comfortless a vehicle for winter as may be well imagined. Now the journey from Castle Richmond to Cork has to be made right across the Boggeragh Mountains. It is over twenty miles Irish; and the road is never very good. Mr. Mollett, therefore, was five hours in the covered car on his return journey; and as he had stopped for lunch at Kanturk, and had not hurried himself at that meal, it was very dark and very cold when he reached the house in South Main Street. \\n\\n \\n\\n I think I have explained that Mr. Mollett senior was not absolutely a drunkard; but nevertheless, he was not averse to spirits in cold weather, and on this journey had warmed himself with whisky once or twice on the road. He had found a shebeen house when he crossed the Nad river, and another on the mountain-top, and a third at the point where the road passes near the village of Blarney, and at all these convenient resting-spots Mr. Mollett had endeavoured to warm himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n There are men who do not become absolutely drunk, but who do become absolutely cross when they drink more than is good for them; and of such men Mr. Mollett was one. What with the cold air, and what with the whisky, and what with the jolting, Mr. Mollett was very cross when he reached the Kanturk Hotel, so that he only cursed the driver instead of giving him the expected gratuity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come to yer honour in the morning,\" said the driver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may go to the devil in the morning,\" answered Mr. Mollett; and this was the first intimation of his return which reached the ears of his expectant son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s the governor,\" said Aby, who was then flirting with Miss O\u0027Dwyer in the bar. \"Somebody\u0027s been stroking him the wrong way of the \u0027air.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The charms of Miss O\u0027Dwyer in these idle days had been too much for the prudence of Mr. Abraham Mollett; by far too much, considering that in his sterner moments his ambition led him to contemplate a match with a young lady of much higher rank in life. But wine, which \"inspires us\" and fires us \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With courage, love, and joy,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n had inspired him with courage to forget his prudence, and with love for the lovely Fanny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, nonsense, Mr. Aby,\" she had said to him a few minutes before the wheels of the covered car were heard in South Main Street. \"You know you main nothing of the sort.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By \u0027eavens, Fanny, I mean every word of it; may this drop be my poison if I don\u0027t. This piece of business here keeps me and the governor hon and hoff like, and will do for some weeks perhaps; but when that\u0027s done, honly say the word, and I\u0027ll make you Mrs. M. Isn\u0027t that fair now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Mr. Aby—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind the mister, Fan, between friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"La! I couldn\u0027t call you Aby without it; could I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Try, my darling.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—Aby—there now. It does sound so uppish, don\u0027t it? But tell me this now; what is the business that you and the old gentleman is about down at Kanturk?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abraham Mollett hereupon had put one finger to his nose, and then winked his eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you care about me, as you say you do, you wouldn\u0027t be shy of just telling me as much as that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s business, Fan; and business and love don\u0027t hamalgamate like whisky and sugar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Mr. Aby; I don\u0027t want to have anything to do with a man who won\u0027t show his rispect by telling me his sacrets.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s it, is it, Fan?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you think I can\u0027t keep a sacret. You think I\u0027d be telling father, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s about some money that\u0027s due to him down there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who from?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He expects to get it from some of those Fitzgerald people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In saying so much Mr. Mollett the younger had not utterly abandoned all prudence. He knew very well that the car-driver and others would be aware that his father had been to Castle Richmond; and that it was more than probable that either he or his father would have to make further visits there. Indeed, he had almost determined that he would go down to the baronet himself. Under these circumstances it might be well that some pretext for these visits should be given. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Which Fitzgerald, Mr. Aby? Is it the Hap House young man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hap House. I never heard of such a place. These people live at Castle Richmond.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh—h—h! If Mr. Mollett have money due there, sure he have a good mark to go upon. Why, Sir Thomas is about the richest man in these parts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And who is this other man; at \u0027Appy—what is it you call his place?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hap House. Oh, it\u0027s he is the thorough-going young gentleman. Only they say he\u0027s a leetle too fast. To my mind, Mr. Owen is the finest-looking man to be seen anywhere\u0027s in the county Cork.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a flame of yours, is he, Fan?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you main by a flame. But there\u0027s not a girl in Cork but what likes the glance of his eye. They do say that he\u0027d have Lady Clara Desmond; only there ain\u0027t no money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what\u0027s he to these other people?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cousin, I believe; or hardly so much as that, I\u0027m thinking. But all the same if anything was to happen to young Mr. Herbert, it would all go to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would, would it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So people say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. \u0027Erbert is the son of the old cock at Castle Richmond, isn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just so. He\u0027s the young cock; he, he, he!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And if he was to be—nowhere like; not his father\u0027s son at all, for instance, it would all go to this \u0027andsome \u0027Appy \u0027Ouse man; would it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Every shilling, they say; house, title, and all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hum,\" said Mr. Abraham Mollett; and he began again to calculate his family chances. Perhaps, after all, this handsome young man who was at present too poor to marry his noble lady love might be the more liberal man to deal with. But then any dealings with him would kill the golden goose at once. All would depend on the size of the one egg which might be extracted. \\n\\n \\n\\n He certainly felt, however, that this Fitzgerald family arrangement was one which it was beneficial that he should know; but he felt also that it would be by no means necessary at present to communicate the information to his father. He put it by in his mind, regarding it as a fund on which he might draw if occasion should require. It might perhaps be pleasant for him to make the acquaintance of this \u0027andsome young Fitzgerald of \u0027Appy \u0027Ouse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And now, Fan, my darling, give us a kiss,\" said he, getting up from his seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Deed and I won\u0027t,\" said Fan, withdrawing herself among the bottles and glasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Deed and you shall, my love,\" said Aby, pertinaciously, as he prepared to follow her through the brittle ware. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hu—sh—be aisy now. There\u0027s Tom. He\u0027s ears for everything, and eyes like a cat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do I care for Tom?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And father \u0027ll be coming in. Be aisy, I tell you. I won\u0027t now, Mr. Aby; and that\u0027s enough. You\u0027ll break the bottle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D—— the bottle. That\u0027s smashed hany way. Come, Fan, what\u0027s a kiss among friends?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cock you up with kisses, indeed! how bad you are for dainties! There; do you hear that? That\u0027s the old gentleman;\" and then, as the voice of Mr. Mollett senior was heard abusing the car-driver, Miss O\u0027Dwyer smoothed her apron, put her hands to her side hair, and removed the debris of the broken bottle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, governor,\" said Aby, \"how goes it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How goes it, indeed! It goes pretty well, I dare say, in here, where you can sit drinking toddy all the evening, and doing nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what on hearth would you have me be doing? Better here than paddling about in the streets, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you could do a stroke of work now and then to earn your bread, it might be better.\" Now Aby knew from experience that whenever his father talked to him about earning his bread, he was half drunk and whole cross. So he made no immediate reply on that point. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are cold I suppose, governor, and had better get a bit of something to eat, and a little tea.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And put my feet in hot water, and tallow my nose, and go to bed, hadn\u0027t I? Miss O\u0027Dwyer, I\u0027ll trouble you to mix me a glass of brandy-punch. Of all the roads I ever travelled, that\u0027s the longest and hardest to get over. Dashed, if I didn\u0027t begin to think I\u0027d never be here.\" And so saying he flung himself into a chair, and put up his feet on the two hobs. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a kettle on one of them, which the young lady pushed a little nearer to the hot coals, in order to show that the water should be boiling; and as she did so Aby gave her a wink over his father\u0027s shoulder, by way of conveying to her an intimation that \"the governor was a little cut,\" or in other language tipsy, and that the brandy-punch should be brewed with a discreet view to past events of the same description. All which Miss O\u0027Dwyer perfectly understood. \\n\\n \\n\\n It may easily be conceived that Aby was especially anxious to receive tidings of what had been done this day down in the Kanturk neighbourhood. He had given his views to his father, as will be remembered; and though Mr. Mollett senior had not professed himself as absolutely agreeing with them, he had nevertheless owned that he was imbued with the necessity of taking some great step. He had gone down to take this great step, and Aby was very anxious to know how it had been taken. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the father and son were both sober, or when the son was tipsy, or when the father was absolutely drunk—an accident which would occur occasionally, the spirit and pluck of the son was in the ascendant. He at such times was the more masterful of the two, and generally contrived, either by persuasion or bullying, to govern his governor. But when it did happen that Mollett père was half drunk and cross with drink, then, at such moments, Mollett fils had to acknowledge to himself that his governor was not to be governed. \\n\\n \\n\\n And, indeed, at such moments his governor could be very disagreeable—could say nasty, bitter things, showing very little parental affection, and make himself altogether bad society, not only to his son, but to his son\u0027s companions also. Now it appeared to Aby that his father was at present in this condition. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had only to egg him on to further drinking, and the respectable gentleman would become stupid, noisy, soft, and affectionate. But then, when in that state, he would blab terribly. It was much with the view of keeping him from that state, that under the present circumstances the son remained with the father. To do the father justice, it may be asserted that he knew his own weakness, and that, knowing it, he had abstained from heavy drinking since he had taken in hand this great piece of diplomacy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you must be hungry, governor; won\u0027t you take a bit of something?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shall we get you a steek, Mr. Mollett?\" asked Miss O\u0027Dwyer, hospitably, \"or just a bit of bacon with a couple of eggs or so? It wouldn\u0027t be a minute, you know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your eggs are all addled and bad,\" said Mr. Mollett; \"and as for a beef-steak, it\u0027s my belief there isn\u0027t such a thing in all Ireland.\" After which civil speech, Miss O\u0027Dwyer winked at Aby, as much as to say, \"You see what a state he\u0027s in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have a bit of buttered toast and a cup of tea, governor,\" suggested the son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m d—— if I do,\" replied the father. \"You\u0027re become uncommon fond of tea of late—that is, for other people. I don\u0027t see you take much of it yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A cup of tay is the thing to warm one afther such a journey as you\u0027ve had; that\u0027s certain, Mr. Mollett,\" said Fanny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them\u0027s your ideas about warming, are they, my dear?\" said the elderly gentleman. \"Do you come and sit down on my knee here for a few minutes or so, and that\u0027d warm me better than all the \u0027tay\u0027 in the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aby showed by his face that he was immeasurably disgusted by the iniquitous coarseness of this overture. Miss O\u0027Dwyer, however, looking at the gentleman\u0027s age, and his state as regarded liquor, passed it over as of no moment whatsoever. So that when, in the later part of the evening, Aby expressed to that young lady his deep disgust, she merely said, \"Oh, bother; what matters an old man like that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then, when they were at this pass, Mr. O\u0027Dwyer came in. He did not interfere much with his daughter in the bar room, but he would occasionally take a dandy of punch there, and ask how things were going on in doors. He was a fat, thickset man, with a good-humoured face, a flattened nose, and a great aptitude for stable occupations. He was part owner of the Kanturk car, as has been before said, and was the proprietor of sundry other cars, open cars and covered cars, plying for hire in the streets of Cork. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope the mare took your honour well down to Kanturk and back again,\" said he, addressing his elder customer with a chuck of his head intended for a bow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you call well,\" said Mr. Mollett. \"She hadn\u0027t a leg to stand upon for the last three hours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a leg to stand upon! Faix, then, and it\u0027s she\u0027d have the four good legs if she travelled every inch of the way from Donagh-a-Dee to Ti-vora,\" to which distance Mr. O\u0027Dwyer specially referred as being supposed to be the longest known in Ireland. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She may be able to do that; but I\u0027m blessed if she\u0027s fit to go to Kanturk and back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s done the work, anyhow,\" said Mr. O\u0027Dwyer, who evidently thought that this last argument was conclusive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And a precious time she\u0027s been about it. Why, my goodness, it would have been better for me to have walked it. As Sir Thomas said to me—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! did you see Sir Thomas Fitzgerald?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hereupon Aby gave his father a nudge; but the father either did not appreciate the nudge, or did not choose to obey it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I did see him. Why shouldn\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only they do say he\u0027s hard to get to speak to now-a-days. He\u0027s not over well, you know, these years back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well or ill he\u0027ll see me, I take it, when I go that distance to ask him. There\u0027s no doubt about that; is there, Aby?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t say, I\u0027m sure, not knowing the gentleman,\" said Aby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We holds land from Sir Thomas, we do; that is, me and my brother Mick, and a better landlord ain\u0027t nowhere,\" said Mr. O\u0027Dwyer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re one of the tenants, are you? The rents are paid pretty well, ain\u0027t they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To the day,\" said Mr. O\u0027Dwyer, proudly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would you think now—\" Mr. Mollett was continuing; but Aby interrupted him somewhat violently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold your confounded stupid tongue, will you, you old jolterhead;\" and on this occasion he put his hand on his father\u0027s shoulder and shook him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who are you calling jolterhead? Who do you dare to speak to in that way? you impudent young cub you. Am I to ask your leave when I want to open my mouth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aby had well known that his father in his present mood would not stand the manner in which the interruption was attempted. Nor did he wish to quarrel before the publican and his daughter. But anything was better than allowing his father to continue in the strain in which he was talking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are talking of things which you don\u0027t hunderstand, and about people you don\u0027t know,\" said Aby. \"You\u0027ve had a drop too much on the road too, and you \u0027ad better go to bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Mollett turned round to strike at his son; but even in his present state he was somewhat quelled by Aby\u0027s eye. Aby was keenly alive to the necessity for prudence on his father\u0027s part, though he was by no means able to be prudent himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Talking of things which I don\u0027t understand, am I?\" said the old man. \"That\u0027s all you know about it. Give me another glass of that brandy toddy, my dear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Aby\u0027s look had quelled, or at any rate silenced him; and though he did advance another stage in tipsiness before they succeeded in getting him off to bed, he said no more about Sir Thomas Fitzgerald or his Castle Richmond secrets. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nevertheless, he had said enough to cause suspicion. One would not have imagined, on looking at Mr. O\u0027Dwyer, that he was a very crafty person, or one of whose finesse in affairs of the world it would be necessary to stand much in awe. He seemed to be thick, and stolid, and incapable of deep inquiry; but, nevertheless, he was as fond of his neighbours\u0027 affairs as another, and knew as much about the affairs of his neighbours at Kanturk as any man in the county Cork. \\n\\n \\n\\n He himself was a Kanturk man, and his wife had been a Kanturk woman; no less a person, indeed, than the sister of Father Bernard M\u0027Carthy, rest her soul;—for it was now at peace, let us all hope. She had been dead these ten years; but he did not the less keep up his connection with the old town, or with his brother-in-law the priest, or with the affairs of the persons there adjacent; especially, we may say, those of his landlord, Sir Thomas Fitzgerald, under whom he still held a small farm, in conjunction with his brother Mick, the publican at Kanturk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s all that about Sir Thomas?\" said he to his daughter in a low voice as soon as the Molletts had left the bar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t just know,\" said Fanny. She was a good daughter, and loved her father, whose indoor affairs she kept tight enough for him. But she had hardly made up her mind as yet whether or no it would suit her to be Mrs. Abraham Mollett. Should such be her destiny, it might be as well for her not to talk about her husband\u0027s matters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it true that the old man did see Sir Thomas to-day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You heard what passed, father; but I suppose it is true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the young \u0027un has been down to Kanturk two or three times. What can the like of them have to do with Sir Thomas?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To this Fanny could only say that she knew nothing about it, which in the main was true. Aby, indeed, had said that his father had gone down to collect money that was due to him; but then Fanny did not believe all that Aby said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like that young \u0027un at all,\" continued Mr. O\u0027Dwyer. \"He\u0027s a nasty, sneaking fellow, as cares for no one but his own belly. I\u0027m not over fond of the old \u0027un neither.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They is both free enough with their money, father,\" said the prudent daughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, they is welcome in the way of business, in course. But look here, Fan; don\u0027t you have nothing to say to that Aby; do you hear me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who? I? ha, ha, ha!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all very well laughing; but mind what I says, for I won\u0027t have it. He is a nasty, sneaking, good-for-nothing fellow, besides being a heretic. What\u0027d your uncle Bernard say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! for the matter of that, if I took a liking to a fellow I shouldn\u0027t ask Uncle Bernard what he had to say. If he didn\u0027t like it, I suppose he might do the other thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I won\u0027t have it. Do you hear that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Laws, father, what nonsense you do talk. Who\u0027s thinking about the man? He comes here for what he wants to ate and dhrink, and I suppose the house is free to him as another. If not we\u0027d betther just shut up the front door.\" After which she tossed herself up and began to wipe her glasses in a rather dignified manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. O\u0027Dwyer sat smoking his pipe and chewing the cud of his reflections. \"They ain\u0027t afther no good; I\u0027m sure of that.\" In saying which, however, he referred to the doings of the Molletts down at Kanturk, rather than to any amatory proceedings which might have taken place between the young man and his daughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the following morning Mr. Mollett senior awoke with a racking headache. My belief is, that when men pay this penalty for drinking, they are partly absolved from other penalties. The penalties on drink are various. I mean those which affect the body, exclusive of those which affect the mind. There are great red swollen noses, very disagreeable both to the wearer and his acquaintances; there are morning headaches, awful to be thought of; there are sick stomachs, by which means the offender escapes through a speedy purgatory; there are sallow cheeks, sunken eyes, and shaking shoulders; there are very big bellies, and no bellies at all; and there is delirium tremens. For the most part a man escapes with one of these penalties. If he have a racking headache, his general health does not usually suffer so much as though he had endured no such immediate vengeance from violated nature. Young Aby when he drank had no headaches; but his eye was bloodshot, his cheek bloated, and his hand shook. His father, on the other hand, could not raise his head after a debauch; but when that was gone, all ill results of his imprudence seemed to have vanished. \\n\\n \\n\\n At about noon on that day Aby was sitting by his father\u0027s bedside. Up to that time it had been quite impossible to induce him to speak a word. He could only groan, swallow soda-water with \"hairs of the dog that bit him\" in it, and lay with his head between his arms. But soon after noon Aby did induce him to say a word or two. The door of the room was closely shut, the little table was strewed with soda-water bottles and last drops of small goes of brandy. Aby himself had a cigar in his mouth, and on the floor near the bed-foot was a plate with a cold, greasy mutton chop, Aby having endeavoured in vain to induce his father to fortify exhausted nature by eating. The appearance of the room and the air within it would not have been pleasant to fastidious people. But then the Molletts were not fastidious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did see Sir Thomas, then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I did see him. I wish, Aby, you\u0027d let me lie just for another hour or so. I\u0027d be all right then. The jolting of that confounded car has nearly shaken my head to pieces.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Aby was by no means inclined to be so merciful. The probability was that he would be able to pump his father more thoroughly in his present weak state than he might do in a later part of the afternoon; so he persevered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, governor, it\u0027s so important we should know what we\u0027re about. Did you see any one else except himself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw them all I believe, except her. I was told she never showed in the morning; but I\u0027m blessed if I don\u0027t think I saw the skirt of her dress through an open door. I\u0027ll tell you what, Aby, I could not stand that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps, father, after hall it\u0027ll be better I should manage the business down there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe there won\u0027t be much more to manage. But, Aby, do leave me now, there\u0027s a good fellow; then in another hour or so I\u0027ll get up, and we\u0027ll have it all out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you\u0027re out in the open air and comfortable, it won\u0027t be fair to be bothering you with business. Come, governor, ten minutes will tell the whole of it if you\u0027ll only mind your eye. How did you begin with Sir Thomas?\" And then Aby went to the door, opened it very gently, and satisfied himself that there was nobody listening on the landing-place. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Mollett sighed wearily, but he knew that his only hope was to get this job of talking over. \"What was it you were saying, Aby?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you begin with Sir Thomas?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did I begin with him? Let me see. Oh! I just told him who I was; and then he turned away and looked down under the fire like, and I thought he was going to make a faint of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t suppose he would be very glad to see you, governor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I saw how badly he took it, and how wretched he seemed, I almost made up my mind to go away and never trouble him any more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did, did you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And just to take what he\u0027d choose to give me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, them\u0027s your hideas, hare they? Then I tell you what; I shall just take the matter into my own hands hentirely. You have no more \u0027eart than a chicken.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s very well, Aby; but you did not see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think that would make hany difference? When a man\u0027s a job of work to do, \u0027e should do it. Them\u0027s my notions. Do you think a man like that is to go and hact in that way, and then not pay for it? Whose wife is she I\u0027d like to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a tone of injured justice about Aby which almost roused the father to participate in the son\u0027s indignation. \"Well; I did my best, though the old gentleman was in such a taking,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what was your best? Come, out with it at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I—m-m. I—just told him who I was, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess he understood that quite well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And then I said things weren\u0027t going exactly well with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have said that at all. What matters that to him? What you hask for you hask for because you\u0027re able to demand it. That\u0027s the ground for hus to take, and by —— I\u0027ll take it too. There shall be no \u0027alf-measures with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And then I told him—just what we were agreed, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That we\u0027d go snacks in the whole concern?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t exactly say that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then what the devil did you say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I told him that, looking at what the property was, twelve hundred pounds wasn\u0027t much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think not either.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that if his son was to be allowed to have it all—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A bastard, you know, keeping it away from the proper heir.\" It may almost be doubted whether, in so speaking, Aby did not almost think that he himself had a legitimate right to inherit the property at Castle Richmond. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He must look to pay up handsome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But did you say what \u0027andsome meant?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t—not then. He fell about upon the table like, and I wasn\u0027t quite sure he wouldn\u0027t make a die of it; and then heaven knows what might have happened to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Psha; you \u0027as no pluck, governor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Aby, I ain\u0027t so sure you\u0027d have such an uncommon deal of pluck yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll try, at any rate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t such a pleasant thing to see an old gentleman in that state. And what would happen if he chose to ring the bell and order the police to take me? Have you ever thought of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gammon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it isn\u0027t gammon. A word from him would put me into quod, and there I should be for the rest of my days. But what would you care for that?\" And poor Mr. Mollett senior shook under the bedclothes as his attention became turned to this very dreary aspect of his affairs. \"Pluck, indeed! I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Aby, I often wonder at my own pluck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Psha! Wouldn\u0027t a word from you split upon him, and upon her, and upon the young \u0027un, and ruin \u0027em? Or a word from me either, for the matter of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Mollett senior shook again. He repented now, as he had already done twenty times, that he had taken that son of his into his confidence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what on hearth did you say to him?\" continued Aby. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, not much more then; at least, not very much more. There was a good deal of words, but they didn\u0027t seem to lead to much, except this, just to make him understand that he must come down handsome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And there was nothing done about Hemmiline?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said the father, rather shortly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If that was settled, that would be the clincher. There would be no further trouble to nobody then. It would be all smooth sailing for your life, governor, and lots of tin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you what it is, Aby, you may just drop that, for I won\u0027t have the young lady bothered about it, nor yet the young lady\u0027s father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t, won\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I won\u0027t; so there\u0027s an end of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose I may pay my distresses to any young lady if I think fitting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And have yourself kicked into the ditch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know too much for kicking, governor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They shall know as much as you do, and more too, if you go on with that. There\u0027s a measure in all things. I won\u0027t have it done, so I tell you.\" And the father turned his face round to the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was by no means the end of the conversation, though we need not verbatim go through any more of it. It appeared that old Mollett had told Sir Thomas that his permanent silence could be purchased by nothing short of a settled \"genteel\" income for himself and his son, no absolute sum having been mentioned; and that Sir Thomas had required a fortnight for his answer, which answer was to be conveyed to Mr. Mollett verbally at the end of that time. It was agreed that Mr. Mollett should repeat his visit to Castle Richmond on that day fortnight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the mean time I\u0027ll go down and freshen the old gentleman up a bit,\" said Aby, as he left his father\u0027s bedroom. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2728/75144.html","bookId":1403,"book":{"id":1403,"title":"Castle Richmond","description":"简介： Castle Richmond was written in 1861, long after Trollope had left Ireland.
