{"id":68409,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"THE AVENUE FOCH seemed to have been built for the richest people in the world. A wide road running from the Arc de Triomphe to the Bois de Boulogne, it had ornamental gardens on both sides flanked by inner roads giving access to the palatial houses. Number 84 was an elegant residence with a broad staircase leading to five stories of charming rooms. The Gestapo had turned it into a house of torture. Dieter sat in a perfectly proportioned drawing room, stared at the intricately decorated ceiling for a moment, then closed his eyes, preparing himself for the interrogation. He had to sharpen his wits and at the same time numb his feelings. Some men enjoyed torturing prisoners. Sergeant Becker in Reims was one. They smiled when their victims screamed, they got erections as they inflicted wounds, and they experienced orgasms during their victims\u0027 death throes. But they were not good interrogators, for they focused on pain rather than information. The best torturers were men such as Dieter who loathed the process from the bottom of their hearts. Now he imagined himself closing doors in his soul, shutting his emotions away in cupboards. He thought of the two women as pieces of machinery that would disgorge information as soon as he figured out how to switch them on. He felt a familiar coldness settle over him like a blanket of snow, and he knew he was ready. \"Bring the older one,\" he said. Lieutenant Hesse went to fetch her. He watched her carefully as she came in and sat in the chair. She had short hair and broad shoulders and wore a man-tailored suit. Her right hand hung limply, and she was supporting the swollen forearm with her left hand: Dieter had broken her wrist. She was obviously in pain, her face pale and gleaming with sweat, but her lips were set in a line of grim determination. He spoke to her in French. \"Everything that happens in this room is under your control,\" he said. \"The decisions you make, the things you say, will either cause you unbearable pain or bring you relief. It is entirely up to you.\" She said nothing. She was scared, but she did not panic. She was going to be difficult to break, he could tell already. He said, \"To begin with, tell me where the London headquarters of the Special Operations Executive is located.\" \"Eighty-one Regent Street,\" she said. He nodded. \"Let me explain something. I realize that SOE teaches its agents not to remain silent under questioning but to give false answers that will be difficult to check. Because I know this, I will ask you many questions to which I already know the answers. This way I will know whether you are lying to me. Where is the London headquarters?\" \"Carlton House Terrace.\" He walked across to her and slapped her face as hard as he could. She cried out in pain. Her cheek turned an angry red. It was often useful to begin with a slap in the face. The pain was minimal, but the blow was a humiliating demonstration of the helplessness of the prisoner, and it quickly sapped their initial bravery. But she looked defiantly at him. \"Is that how German officers treat ladies?\" She had a haughty manner, and she spoke French with the accent of the upper classes. She was some kind of aristocrat, he guessed, \"Ladies?\" he said scornfully. \"You have just shot and killed two policemen who were going about their lawful business. Specht\u0027s young wife is now a widow, and Rolfe\u0027s parents have lost their only child. You\u0027re not a soldier in uniform, you have no excuse. In answer to your question-no, this is not how we treat ladies, it\u0027s how we treat murderers.\" She looked away. He had scored a hit with that remark. He was beginning to undermine her moral foundation. \"Tell me something else,\" he said. \"How well do you know Flick Clairet?\" Her eyes widened in an involuntary expression of surprise. That told him he had guessed correctly. These two were part of Major Clairet\u0027s team. He had shaken her again. But she recovered her composure and said, \"I don\u0027t know anyone of that name.\" He reached down and knocked her left hand away. She cried out in pain as her broken wrist lost its support and sagged. He took her right hand and jerked it. She screamed. \"Why were you having dinner at the Ritz, for God\u0027s sake?\" he said. He released her hand. She stopped screaming. He repeated the question. She caught her breath and said, \"I like the food there.\" She was even tougher than he had thought. \"Take her away,\" he said. \"Bring the other one.\" The younger girl was quite pretty. She had put up no resistance when arrested, so she still looked presentable, her dress unruffled and her makeup intact. She appeared much more frightened than her colleague. He asked her the question he had asked the older one: \"Why were you having dinner at the Ritz?\" \"I\u0027ve always wanted to go there,\" she replied. He could hardly believe his ears. \"Weren\u0027t you afraid it might be dangerous?\" \"I thought Diana would look after me.\" So the other one\u0027s name was Diana. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Maude.\" This was suspiciously easy. \"And what are you doing in France, Maude?\" \"We were supposed to blow something up.\" \"What?\" \"I don\u0027t remember. Would it have something to do with railways?\" Dieter began to wonder whether he was being led up the garden path. \"How long have you known Felicity Clairet?\" he tried. \"Do you mean flick? Only a few days. She\u0027s awfully bossy.\" A thought crossed her mind. \"She was right, though-we shouldn\u0027t have gone to the Ritz.\" She began to cry. \"I never meant to do anything wrong. I just wanted to have a good time and see places, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever wanted.\" \"What\u0027s your team\u0027s code name?\" \"The Blackbirds,\" she said in English. He frowned. The radio message to Helicopter had referred to them as Jackdaws. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes. It\u0027s because of some poem, \u0027The Blackbird of Reims,\u0027 I think. No, \u0027The Jackdaw of Reims,\u0027 that\u0027s it.\" If she was not completely stupid, she was doing a very good imitation. \"Where do you think Flick is now?\" Maude thought for a long moment, then said, \"I really don\u0027t know.\" Dieter sighed in frustration. One prisoner was too tough to talk, the other too stupid to know anything useful. This was going to take longer than he had hoped. There might be a way of shortening the process. He was curious about the relationship between these two. Why had the dominant, mannish older woman risked her life to take the pretty, empty-headed girl to dinner at the Ritz? Perhaps I\u0027ve got a dirty mind, he said to himself But still... \"Take her away,\" he said in German. \"Put her in with the other one. Make sure the room has a judas.\" When they had been locked away, Lieutenant Hesse showed Dieter to a small room in the attic. He looked through a peephole into the room next door. The two women were sitting side by side on the edge of the narrow bed. Maude was crying and Diana was comforting her. Dieter watched carefully. Diana\u0027s broken right wrist rested in her lap. With her left hand she stroked Maude\u0027s hair. She was talking in a low voice, but Dieter could not hear the words. How close a relationship was this? Were they comrades in arms, bosom friends. or more? Diana leaned forward and kissed Maude\u0027s forehead. That did not mean much. Then Diana put a forefinger on Maude\u0027s chin, turned the girl\u0027s face to her own, and kissed her lips. It was a gesture of comfort, but surely too intimate for a mere friend? Finally Diana poked out the tip of her tongue and licked Maude\u0027s tears. That made up Dieter\u0027s mind. It was not foreplay-no one could have sex in such circumstances-but it was the kind of comfort that would be offered only by a lover, not by a mere friend. Diana and Maude were lesbians. And that solved the problem. \"Bring the older one again,\" he said, and he returned to the interview room. When Diana was brought in the second time, he had her tied to the chair. Then he said, \"Prepare the electrical machinery.\" He waited impatiently while the electric shock machine was rolled in on its trolley and plugged to a socket in the wall. Every minute that passed was taking Flick Clairet farther away from him. When everything was ready, he seized Diana by the hair with his left hand. Holding her head still, he attached two crocodile clips to her lower lip. He turned the power on. Diana screamed. He left it on for ten seconds, then switched off. When her sobbing began to ease he said, \"That was less than half power.\" It was true. He had rarely used full power. Only when the torture had gone on a long time, and the prisoner kept passing out, was full power used in an effort to penetrate the subject\u0027s fading consciousness. And by then it was generally too late, for madness was setting in. But Diana did not know that. \"Not again,\" she begged. \"Please, please, not again.\" \"Are you willing to answer my questions?\" She groaned, but she did not say yes. Dieter said, \"Bring the other one.\" Diana gasped. Lieutenant Hesse brought Maude in and tied her to a chair. \"What do you want?\" Maude cried. Diana said, \"Don\u0027t say anything-it\u0027s better.\" Maude was wearing a light summer blouse. She had a neat, trim figure with full breasts. Dieter tore her blouse open, sending the buttons flying. \"Please!\" Maude said. \"I\u0027ll tell you anything!\" Under her blouse she wore a cotton chemise with a lacy trim. He took hold of the neckline and ripped it off. Maude screamed. He stood back and looked. Maude\u0027s breasts were round and firm. A part of his mind noticed how pretty they were. Diana must love them, he thought. He took the crocodile clips from Diana\u0027s mouth and carefully fastened one to each of Maude\u0027s small pink nipples. Then he returned to the machine and put his hand on the control. \"Au right,\" Diana said quietly. \"I\u0027ll tell you everything.\" DIETER ARRANGED FOR the railway tunnel at Manes to be heavily guarded. If the Jackdaws got that far, they would find it almost impossible to enter the tunnel. He felt confident that Flick would not now achieve her objective. But that was secondary. His burning ambition was to capture her and interrogate her. It was already two o\u0027clock on Sunday morning. Tuesday would be the night of the full moon. The invasion could be hours away. But in those few hours Dieter could break the back of the French Resistance-if he could get Flick in a torture chamber. He only needed the list of names and addresses that she had in her head. The Gestapo in every city in France could be galvanized into action, thousands of trained staff. They were not the brightest of men, but they knew how to arrest people. In a couple of hours they could jail hundreds of Resistance cadres. Instead of the massive uprising that the Allies were no doubt hoping for to aid their invasion, there would be calm and order for the Germans to organize their response and push the invaders back into the sea. He had sent a Gestapo team to raid the Hotel de la Chapelle, but that was a matter of form: he was certain Flick and the other three would have left within minutes of the arrest of their comrades. Where was Flick now? Reims was the natural jumping-off point for an attack on Marles, which was why the Jackdaws had originally planned to land near the city. Dieter thought it likely Flick would still pass through Reims. It was on the road and rail routes to Marles, and there was probably some kind of help she needed from the remnants of the Bollinger circuit. He was betting she was now on her way from Paris to Reims. He arranged for every Gestapo checkpoint between the two cities to be given details of the false identities being used by Flick and her team. However that, too, was something of a formality: either they had alternative identities, or they would find ways to avoid the checkpoints. He called Reims, got Weber out of bed, and explained the situation. For once Weber was not obstructive. He agreed to send two Gestapo men to keep an eye on Michel\u0027s town house, two more to watch Gilberte\u0027s building, and two to the house in the rue du Bois to guard Stephanie. Finally, as the headache began, Dieter called Stephanie. \"The British terrorists are on their way to Reims,\" he told her. \"I\u0027m sending two men to guard you.\" She was as calm as ever. \"Thank you.\" \"But it\u0027s important that you continue to go to the rendezvous.\" With luck, Flick would not suspect the extent to which Dieter had penetrated the Bollinger circuit, and she would walk into his arms. \"Remember, we changed the location. It\u0027s not the cathedral crypt any more, it\u0027s the cafee la Gare. If anyone shows up, just drive them back to the house, the way you did with Helicopter. Then the Gestapo can take over from that point.\" \"Okay.\" \"Are you sure? I\u0027ve minimized the risk to you, but it\u0027s still dangerous.\" \"I\u0027m sure. You sound as if you have a migraine.\" \"It\u0027s just beginning.\" \"Do you have the medicine?\" \"Hans has it.\" \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m not there to give it to you.\" He was, too. \"I wanted to drive back to Reims tonight, but I don\u0027t think I can make it.\" \"Don\u0027t you dare. I\u0027ll be fine. Take a shot and go to bed. Come back here tomorrow.\" He knew she was right. It was going to be hard enough getting back to his apartment, less than a kilometer away. He could not travel to Reims until he had recovered from the strain of the interrogation. \"Okay,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll get a few hours\u0027 sleep and leave here in the morning.\" \"Happy birthday.\" \"You remembered! I forgot it myself.\" \"I have something for you.\" \"A gift?\" \"More like.. an action.\" He grinned, despite his headache. \"Oh, boy.\" \"I\u0027ll give it to you tomorrow.\" \"I can\u0027t wait.\" \"I love you.\" The words I love you, too, came to his lips, but he hesitated, reluctant from old habit to say them, and then there was a click as Stephanie hung up.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-38.html","bookId":2681,"book":{"id":2681,"title":"Jackdaws","description":"Storyline: In his own bestselling tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, Ken Follett once again strikes Nazi pay dirt as a gang of all-female saboteurs go behind German lines.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/jackdaws.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:29 AM"}}
