{"id":68385,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"FLICK TURNED AT the building door and saw a pretty girl wearing the uniform of an American lieutenant step out of the car and throw her arms around Paul.\\n\\n She noted the delighted smile on his face and the force of his hug.\\n\\n This was obviously his wife, girlfriend, or fiance probably making an unexpected visit to London.\\n\\n She must be with the U.S.\\n\\n forces in Britain, preparing for the invasion.\\n\\n Paul jumped into her car.\\n\\n Flick went into Orchard Court, feeling a little sad.\\n\\n Paul had a girl, they were nuts about one another, and they had been granted a surprise meeting.\\n\\n Flick wished Michel could show up just like that, out of the blue.\\n\\n But he was lying wounded on a couch in Reims with a shameless nineteen-year-old beauty nursing him.\\n\\n Percy was already back from Hendon.\\n\\n She found him making tea.\\n\\n \"How was your RAF girl?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Lady Denise Bowyer-she\u0027s on her way to the Finishing School,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Wonderful! Now we have four!\" \"But I\u0027m worried.\\n\\n She\u0027s a braggart.\\n\\n She boasted about the work she\u0027s doing in the Air Force, told me all sorts of details she should have kept quiet about.\\n\\n You\u0027ll have to see what you think of her in training.\" \"I don\u0027t suppose she knows anything about telephone exchanges.\" \"Not a thing.\\n\\n Nor explosives.\\n\\n Tea?\" \"Please.\" He handed her a cup and sat behind the cheap old desk.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Paul?\" \"Gone to find the public prosecutor.\\n\\n He\u0027s hoping to get Ruby Romain out of jail this evening.\" Percy gave her a quizzical glance.\\n\\n \"Do you like him?\" \"More than I did initially.\" \"Me too.\" Flick smiled.\\n\\n \"He charmed the socks off the old battleaxe running the prison.\" \"How was Ruby Romain?\" \"Terrifying.\\n\\n She slit the throat of another inmate in a quarrel over a bar of soap.\" \"Jesus.\" Percy shook his head in incredulity.\\n\\n \"What the hell kind of a team are we putting together, Flick?\" \"Dangerous.\\n\\n Which is what it\u0027s supposed to be.\\n\\n That\u0027s not the problem.\\n\\n Besides, the way things are going, we may have the luxury of eliminating the least satisfactory one or two during training.\\n\\n My worry is that we don\u0027t have the experts we need.\\n\\n There\u0027s no point taking a team of tough girls into France, then destroying the wrong cables.\" Percy drained his teacup and began to fill his pipe.\\n\\n \"I know a woman explosives expert who speaks French.\" Flick was surprised.\\n\\n \"But this is great! Why didn\u0027t you say so before?\" \"When I first thought of her, I dismissed her out of hand.\\n\\n She\u0027s not at all suitable.\\n\\n But I hadn\u0027t realized how desperate we\u0027d be.\" \"How is she unsuitable?\" \"She\u0027s about forty.\\n\\n SOE rarely uses anyone so old, especially on a parachute mission.\" He struck a match.\\n\\n Age was not going to be an obstacle at this stage, Flick thought.\\n\\n Excited, she said, \"Will she volunteer?\" \"I should think there\u0027s a good chance, especially if I ask her.\" \"You\u0027re friends.\" He nodded.\\n\\n \"How did she become an explosives expert?\" Percy looked embarrassed.\\n\\n Still holding the burning match, he said, \"She\u0027s a safebreaker.\\n\\n I met her years ago, when I was doing political work in the East End.\" The match burned down, and he struck another.\\n\\n \"Percy, I had no idea your past was so raffish.\\n\\n Where is she now?\" Percy looked at his watch.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s six o\u0027clock.\\n\\n At this time of the evening, she\u0027ll be in the private bar of the Mucky Duck.\" \"A pub.\" \"Yes.\" \"Then get that damn pipe alight and let\u0027s go there now.\" In the car, Flick said, \"How do you know she\u0027s a safebreaker?\" Percy shrugged.\\n\\n \"Everyone knows.\" \"Everyone? Even the police?\" \"Yes.\\n\\n In the East End, police and villains grow up together, go to the same schools, live in the same streets.\\n\\n They all know one another.\" \"But if they know who the criminals are, why don\u0027t they put them in jail? I suppose they can\u0027t prove anything.\" \"This is the way it works,\" Percy said.\\n\\n \"When they need a conviction, they arrest someone who is in that line of business.\\n\\n If it\u0027s a burglary, they arrest a burglar.\\n\\n It doesn\u0027t matter whether he was responsible for that particular crime, because they can always manufacture a case: suborn witnesses, counterfeit confessions, manufacture forensic evidence.\\n\\n Of course, they sometimes make mistakes, and jail innocent people, and they often use the system to pay off personal grudges, and so on; but nothing in life is perfect, is it?\" \"So you\u0027re saying the whole rigmarole of courts and juries is a farce?\" \"A highly successful, long-running farce that provides lucrative employment for otherwise useless citizens who act the parts of detectives, solicitors, banisters, and judges.\" \"Has your friend the safebreaker been to jail?\" \"No.\\n\\n You can escape prosecution if you\u0027re willing to pay hefty bribes, and you\u0027re careful to cultivate warm friendships with detectives.\\n\\n Let\u0027s say you live in the same street as Detective-Inspector Callahan\u0027s dear old mum.\\n\\n You drop in once a week, ask her if she needs any shopping done, look at photos of her grandchildren makes it hard for D.I.\\n\\n Callahan to put you in jail.\" Flick thought of the story Ruby had told a few hours ago.\\n\\n For some people, life in London was almost as bad as being under the Gestapo.\\n\\n Could things really be so different from what she had imagined? \"I can\u0027t tell if you\u0027re serious,\" she said to Percy.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to believe.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m serious,\" he said with a smile.\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t expect you to believe me.\" They were in Stepney, not far from the docks.\\n\\n The bomb damage here was the worst Flick had seen.\\n\\n Whole streets were flattened.\\n\\n Percy turned into a narrow cul-de-sac and parked outside a pub.\\n\\n \"Mucky Duck\" was a humorous sobriquet: the pub was called The White Swan.\\n\\n The private bar was not private, but was so called to distinguish it from the public bar, where there was sawdust on the floor and the beer was a penny a pint cheaper.\\n\\n Flick found herself thinking about explaining these idiosyncrasies to Paul.\\n\\n He would be amused.\\n\\n Geraldine Knight sat on a stool at the end of the bar, looking as if she might own the place.\\n\\n She had vivid blonde hair and heavy makeup, expertly applied.\\n\\n Her plump figure had the apparent firmness that could only have come from a corset.\\n\\n The cigarette burning in the ashtray bore a ring of bright lipstick around the end.\\n\\n It was hard to imagine anyone who looked less like a secret agent, Flick thought despondently.\\n\\n \"Percy Thwaite, as I live and breathe!\" the woman said.\\n\\n She sounded like a Cockney who had been to elocution lessons.\\n\\n \"What are you doing slumming around here, you bloody old communist?\" She was obviously delighted to see him.\\n\\n \"Hello, Jelly, meet my friend Flick,\" Percy said.\\n\\n \"Pleased to know you, I\u0027m sure,\" she said, shaking Flick\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Jelly?\" Flick inquired.\\n\\n \"No one knows where I got that nickname.\" \"Oh,\" said Flick.\\n\\n \"Jelly Knight, gelignite.\" Jelly ignored that.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have a gin-and-It, Percy, while you\u0027re buying.\" Flick spoke to her in French.\\n\\n \"Do you live in this part of London?\" \"Since I was ten,\" she replied, speaking French with a North American accent.\\n\\n \"I was born in Quebec.\" That was not so good, Flick thought.\\n\\n Germans might not notice the accent, but the French certainly would.\\n\\n Jelly would have to pose as a Canadian-born French citizen.\\n\\n It was a perfectly plausible history, but just unusual enough to attract curiosity.\\n\\n Damn.\\n\\n \"But you consider yourself British.\" \"English, not British,\" said Jelly with arch indignation.\\n\\n She switched back to the English language.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Church of England, I vote Conservative, and I dislike foreigners, heathens, and republicans.\" With a glance at Percy, she added, \"Present company excepted, of course.\" Percy said, \"You ought to live in Yorkshire, on a hill farm, someplace where they haven\u0027t seen a foreigner since the Vikings came.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how you can bear to live in London, surrounded by Russian Bolsheviks, German Jews, Irish Catholics, and nonconformist Welshmen building little chapels all over the place like moles disfiguring the lawn.\" \"London\u0027s not what it was, Perce.\" \"Not what it was when you were a foreigner?\" This was obviously a familiar old argument.\\n\\n Flick interrupted it impatiently.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m very glad to hear that you\u0027re so patriotic, Jelly.\" \"And why would you be interested in such a thing, may I ask?\" \"Because there\u0027s something you could do for your country.\" Percy put in, \"I told Flick about your..\\n\\n expertise, Jelly.\" She looked at her vermilion fingernails.\\n\\n \"Discretion, Percy, please.\\n\\n Discretion is the better part of valor, it says in the Bible.\" Flick said, \"I expect you know that there have been some fascinating recent developments in the field.\\n\\n Plastic explosives, I mean.\" \"I try to keep up to date,\" Jelly said with airy modesty.\\n\\n Her expression changed, and she looked shrewdly at Flick.\\n\\n \"This is something to do with the war, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Count me in.\\n\\n I\u0027ll do anything for England.\" \"You\u0027ll be away for a few days.\" \"No problem.\" \"You might not come back.\" \"What the hell does that mean?\" \"It will be very dangerous,\" Flick said quietly.\\n\\n Jelly looked dismayed.\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She swallowed.\\n\\n \"Well, that makes no difference,\" she said unconvincingly.\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\" Jelly looked thoughtful, as if she were calculating.\\n\\n \"You want me to blow something up.\" Flick nodded silently.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not overseas, is it?\" \"Could be.\" Jelly paled beneath her makeup.\\n\\n \"Oh, my gordon.\\n\\n You want me to go to France, don\u0027t you?\" Flick said nothing.\\n\\n \"Behind enemy lines! God\u0027s truth, I\u0027m too bloody old for that sort of thing.\\n\\n I\u0027m ..\\n\\n .\" She hesitated.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thirty- seven.\" She was about five years older than that, Flick thought, but she said, \"Well, we\u0027re almost the same age, I\u0027m nearly thirty.\\n\\n We\u0027re not too old for a bit of adventure, are we?\" \"Speak for yourself~ dear.\" Flick\u0027s heart sank.\\n\\n Jelly was not going to agree.\\n\\n The whole scheme had been misconceived, she decided.\\n\\n It was never going to be possible to find women who could do these jobs and speak perfect French.\\n\\n The plan had been doomed from the start.\\n\\n She turned away from Jelly.\\n\\n She felt like crying.\\n\\n Percy said, \"Jelly, we\u0027re asking you to do a job that\u0027s really crucial for the war effort.\" \"Pull the other leg, Perce, it\u0027s got bells on,\" she said, but her mockery was halfhearted, and she looked solemn.\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n \"No exaggeration.\\n\\n It could make a difference to whether we win or lose.\" She stared at him, saying nothing.\\n\\n Conflict twisted her face into a grimace of indecision.\\n\\n Percy said, \"And you\u0027re the only person in the country who can do it.\" \"Get off,\" she said skeptically.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a female safebreaker who speaks French- how many others do you think there are? I\u0027ll tell you: none.\" \"You mean this, don\u0027t you.\" \"I was never more serious in my life.\" \"Bloody hell, Perce.\" Jelly fell silent.\\n\\n She did not speak for a long moment.\\n\\n Flick held her breath.\\n\\n At last Jelly said, \"All right, you bastard, I\u0027ll do it.\" Flick was so pleased she kissed her.\\n\\n Percy said, \"God bless you, Jelly.\" Jelly said, \"When do we start?\" \"Now,\" said Percy.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027ll finish up that gin, I\u0027ll take you home to pack a case; then I\u0027ll drive you to the training center.\" \"What, tonight?\" \"I told you it was important.\" She swallowed the remains of her drink.\\n\\n \"All right, I\u0027m ready.\" She slid her ample bottom off the bar stool, and Flick thought: I wonder how she\u0027ll manage with a parachute.\\n\\n They left the pub.\\n\\n Percy said to Flick, \"You\u0027ll be all right going back on the Thbe?\" \"Of course.\" \"Then we\u0027ll see you tomorrow at the Finishing School.\" \"I\u0027ll be there,\" said Flick, and they parted company.\\n\\n She headed for the nearest station, feeling jubilant.\\n\\n It was a mild summer evening, and the East End was alive: a group of dirty-faced boys played cricket with a stick and a bald tennis ball; a tired man in soiled work clothes headed home for a late tea; a uniformed soldier, on leave with a packet of cigarettes and a few shillings in his pocket, strode along the pavement with a jaunty air, as if all the world\u0027s pleasures were his for the taking; three pretty girls in sleeveless dresses and straw hats giggled at the soldier.\\n\\n The fate of all these people would be decided in the next few days, Flick thought somberly.\\n\\n On the train to Bayswater, her spirits fell again.\\n\\n She still did not have the most crucial member of the team.\\n\\n Without a telephone engineer, Jelly might place the explosives in the wrong location.\\n\\n They would still do damage but, if the damage could be repaired in a day or two, the enormous effort and risk of life would have been wasted.\\n\\n When she returned to her bedsitting room, she found her brother Mark waiting there.\\n\\n She hugged and kissed him.\\n\\n \"What a nice surprise!\" she said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a night off, so I thought I\u0027d take you for a drink,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Steve?\" \"Giving his lago to the troops in Lyme Regis.\\n\\n We both work for ENSA most of the time, now.\" ENSA was the Entertainments National Service Association, which organized shows for the armed forces.\\n\\n \"Where shall we go?\" Flick was tired, and her first inclination was to turn him down.\\n\\n Then she remembered that she was going to France on Friday, and this could be the last time she ever saw her brother.\\n\\n \"How about the West End,\" she said.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll go to a nightclub.\" \"Perfect!\" They left the house and walked arm-in-arm along the street.\\n\\n Flick said, \"I saw Ma this morning.\" \"How is she?\" \"All right, but she hasn\u0027t softened her attitude to you and Steve, I\u0027m sorry to say.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect it.\\n\\n How did you happen to see her?\" \"I went down to Somersholme.\\n\\n It would take too long to explain why.\" \"Something hush-hush, I suppose.\" She smiled acknowledgment, then sighed as she remembered her problem.\"! don\u0027t suppose you happen to know a female telephone engineer who speaks French, do you?\" He stopped.\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"sort of.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-14.html","bookId":2681,"book":{"id":2681,"title":"Jackdaws","description":"Storyline: In his own bestselling tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, Ken Follett once again strikes Nazi pay dirt as a gang of all-female saboteurs go behind German lines.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/jackdaws.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:29 AM"}}
