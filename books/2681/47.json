Ruby, Jelly, and Greta sat at a separate table, not acknowledging them. Flick kept an eye on the street outside. She knew that Michel was in terrible danger. She had contemplated going to warn him. She could have gone to the Moulier place-but that would have played into the hands of the Gestapo, who must be following Michelin the hope that he would lead them to her. Even to phone the Moulier place would have risked betraying her hideout to a Gestapo eavesdropper at the telephone exchange. In fact, she had decided, the best thing she could do to help Michel was not to contact him directly. If her theory was right, Dieter Franck would let Michel remain at large until Flick was caught. So she had left a message for Michel with Madame LapeMeme. It read: Michel- I am sure you are under surveillance. The place we were at last night was raided after you left. You have probably been followed this morning. We will leave before you get here and make ourselves inconspicuous in the town center. Park the van near the railway station and leave the key under the driver\u0027s seat. Get a train to Marles. Shake off your shadow and come back. Be careful-please! -Flick Now burn this. It seemed good in theory, but she waited all morning in a fever of tension to see whether it would work. Then, at eleven o\u0027clock, she saw a high van draw up and park near the station entrance. Flick held her breath. On the side, in white lettering, she read Moulier \u0026 Fils-Viandes. Michel got out, and she breathed again. He walked into the station. He was carrying out her plan. She looked to see who might be following him, but it was impossible. People arrived at the station constantly, on foot, on bicycles, and in cars, and any of them might have been shadowing Michel. She remained in the cafepretending to drink the bitter, unsatisfying coffee substitute, keeping an eye on the van, trying to discover whether it was under surveillance. She studied the people and vehicles coming and going outside the station, but she did not spot anyone who might have been watching the van. After fifteen minutes, she nodded to Paul. They got up, picked up their cases, and walked out. Flick opened the van door and got into the driver\u0027s seat. Paul got in the other side. Flick\u0027s heart was in her mouth. If this was a Gestapo trap, now would be the moment when they arrested her. She fumbled beneath her seat and found a key. She started the van. She looked around. No one seemed to have noticed her. Ruby, Jelly, and Greta came out of the cafeFlick jerked her head to indicate that they should get in the back. She looked over her shoulder. The van was fitted out with shelves and cupboards, and trays for ice to keep the temperature down. Everything looked as if it had been well scrubbed, but there remained a faint, unpleasant odor of raw meat. The rear doors opened. The other three women threw their suitcases into the van and clambered in after them. Ruby pulled the doors shut. Flick put the gearshift into first and drove away. \"We did it!\" Jelly said. \"Thank gordon.\" Flick smiled thinly. The hard part was still ahead. She drove out of town on the road to Sainte-Cecile. She watched for police cars and Gestapo Citroens, but she felt fairly safe for the moment. The van\u0027s lettering announced its legitimacy. And it was not unusual for a woman to be driving such a vehicle, when so many Frenchmen were in labor camps in Germany-or had fled to the hills and joined the Maquis to avoid being sent to the camps. Soon after midday they reached Sainte-Cecile. Flick noted the sudden miraculous quiet that always fell on French streets at the stroke of noon, as the people turned their attention to the first serious meal of the day. She drove to Antoinette\u0027s building. A pair of tall wooden doors, half-open, led to the inner courtyard. Paul leaped out of the van and opened the doors, Flick drove in, and Paul closed the doors behind her. Now the van, with its distinctive legend, could not be seen from the street. \"Come when I whistle,\" Flick said, and she jumped out. She went to Antoinette\u0027s door while the others waited in the van. Last time she had knocked on this door, eight days and a lifetime ago, Michel\u0027s aunt Antoinette had hesitated to answer, jumpy on account of the gunfire from the square, but today she came right away. She opened the door, a slim middle-aged woman in a stylish but faded yellow cotton dress. She looked blankly at Flick for a moment: Flick still had on the dark wig. Then recognition dawned. \"You!\" she said. A look of panic came over her face. \"What do you want?\" Flick whistled to the others, then pushed Antoinette back inside. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" she said. \"We\u0027re going to tie you up so the Germans will think we forced you.\" \"What is this?\" Antoinette said shakily \"I\u0027ll explain in a moment. Are you alone?\" \"Yes.\" \"Good.\" The others came in and Ruby closed the apartment door. They went into Antoinette\u0027s kitchen. A meal was laid out on the table: black bread, a salad of shredded carrots, a heel of cheese, a wine bottle without a label. Antoinette said again, \"What is this?\" \"Sit down,\" Flick said. \"Finish your lunch.\" She sat down, but she said, \"I can\u0027t eat.\" \"It\u0027s very simple,\" Flick said. \"You and your ladies are not going to clean the chateau tonight.. we are.\" She looked baffled. \"How will that happen?\" \"We\u0027re going to send notes to each of the women on duty tonight, telling them to come here and see you before they go to work. When they arrive, we will tie them up. Then we will go to the chateau instead of them.\" \"You can\u0027t, you don\u0027t have passes.\" \"Yes, we do.\" \"How. ?\" Antoinette gasped. \"You stole my pass! Last Sunday. I thought I had lost it. I got into the most terrible trouble with the Germans!\" \"I\u0027m sorry you got into trouble.\" \"But this will be worse-you\u0027re going to blow the place up!\" Antoinette began to moan and rock. \"They\u0027ll blame me, you know what they\u0027re like, we\u0027ll all be tortured.\" Flick gritted her teeth. She knew that Antoinette could be right. The Gestapo might easily kill the real cleaners just in case they had had something to do with the deception. \"We\u0027re going to do everything we can to make you look innocent,\" she said. \"You will be our victims, the same as the Germans.\" All the same, there remained a risk, Flick knew. \"They won\u0027t believe us,\" Antoinette moaned. \"We might be killed.\" Flick hardened her heart. \"Yes,\" she said. \"That\u0027s why it\u0027s called a war.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-47.html","bookId":2681,"book":{"id":2681,"title":"Jackdaws","description":"Storyline: In his own bestselling tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, Ken Follett once again strikes Nazi pay dirt as a gang of all-female saboteurs go behind German lines.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/jackdaws.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:29 AM"}}
