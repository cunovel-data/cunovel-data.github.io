{"id":68393,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"DIETER SLEPT A few hours at the Hotel Frankfort and got up at two a.m.\\n\\n He was alone: Stephanie was at the house in the rue du Bois with the British agent Helicopter.\\n\\n Some time this morning, Helicopter would go in search of the head of the Bollinger circuit, and Dieter had to follow him.\\n\\n He knew Helicopter would start at Michel Clairet\u0027s house, so he had decided to put a surveillance team there by first light.\\n\\n He drove to Sainte-Cecile in the early hours, winding through the moonlit vineyards in his big car, and parked in front of the chateau.\\n\\n He went first to the photo lab in the basement.\\n\\n There was no one in the darkroom, but his prints were there, pegged on a line to dry like laundry.\\n\\n He had asked for two copies of Helicopter\u0027s picture of Flick CJairet.\\n\\n He took them off the line and studied one, remembering the way she had run through gunfire to rescue her husband.\\n\\n He tried to see some of that steely nerve in the carefree expression of the pretty girl in the swimsuit, but there was no sign of it.\\n\\n No doubt it had come with war.\\n\\n He pocketed the negative and picked up the original photo, which would have to be returned surreptitiously to Helicopter.\\n\\n He found an envelope and a sheet of plain paper, thought for a moment, and wrote:\\n\\n My darling, While Helicopter is shaving, please put this in his inside jacket pocket, so that it will look as if it slipped out of his wallet.\\n\\n Thank you.\\n\\n D.\\n\\n He put the note and the picture in the envelope, sealed it, and wrote: \"Mlle.\\n\\n Lemas\" on the front.\\n\\n He would drop it off later.\\n\\n He passed the cells and looked through a judas at Marie, the girl who had surprised him yesterday by showing up at the house in the rue du Bois with food for Mademoiselle Lemas\u0027s \"guests.\" She lay on a bloodstained sheet, staring at the wall with a wide-eyed gaze of horror, emitting a constant low moan like a piece of machinery that was broken but not switched off.\\n\\n Dieter had interrogated Marie last night.\\n\\n She had had no useful information.\\n\\n She had claimed she knew no one in the Resistance, only Mademoiselle Lemas.\\n\\n Dieter had been inclined to believe her, but he had let Sergeant Becker torture her just in case.\\n\\n However, she had not changed her story, and he now felt confident that her disappearance would not alert the Resistance to the impostor in the rue du Bois.\\n\\n He suffered a moment of depression as he stared at the wrecked body.\\n\\n He remembered her coming up the path yesterday with her bicycle, a picture of vigorous health.\\n\\n She had been a happy girl, albeit foolish.\\n\\n She had made a simple mistake, and now her life was coming to a ghastly end.\\n\\n She deserved her fate, of course; she had helped terrorists.\\n\\n All the same, it was horrible to contemplate.\\n\\n He put her out of his mind and went up the stairs.\\n\\n On the ground floor, the night shift telephonists were at their switchboards.\\n\\n Above that, on what had once been a floor of impossibly grand bedrooms, were the Gestapo offices.\\n\\n Dieter had not seen Weber since the fiasco in the cathedral and assumed the man was licking his wounds somewhere.\\n\\n However, he had spoken to Weber\u0027s deputy and asked for four Gestapo men to be here in plain clothes at three a.m.\\n\\n ready for a day\u0027s surveillance.\\n\\n Dieter had also ordered Lieutenant Hesse to be here.\\n\\n Now he pulled aside a blackout blind and looked out.\\n\\n Moonlight illuminated the parking lot, and he could see Hans walking across the yard, but there was no sign of anyone else.\\n\\n He went to Weber\u0027s office and was surprised to find him there alone, behind his desk, pretending to work on some papers by the light of a green-shaded lamp.\\n\\n \"Where are the men I asked for?\" Dieter said.\\n\\n Weber stood up.\\n\\n \"You pulled a gun on me yesterday,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What the devil do you mean by threatening an officer?\" Dieter had not expected this.\\n\\n Weber was being aggressive about an incident in which he had made a fool of himself Was it possible that he did not understand what a dreadful mistake he had made? \"It was your own damn fault, you idiot,\" Dieter said in exasperation.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want that man arrested.\" \"You can be court-martialed for what you did.\" Dieter was about to ridicule the idea; then he stopped himself~ It was true, he realized.\\n\\n He had simply done what was necessary to rescue the situation; but it was not impossible, in the bureaucratic Third Reich, for an officer to be arraigned for using his initiative.\\n\\n His heart sank, and he had to feign confidence.\\n\\n \"Go ahead, report me, I think I can justify myself in front of a tribunal.\" \"You actually fired your gun!\" Dieter could not resist saying, \"I suppose that\u0027s something you haven\u0027t often witnessed, in your military career.\" Weber flushed.\\n\\n He had never seen action.\\n\\n \"Guns should be used against the enemy, not fellow officers.\" \"I fired into the air.\\n\\n I\u0027m sorry if I frightened you.\\n\\n You were in the process of ruining a first-class counterintelligence coup.\\n\\n Don\u0027t you think a military court would take that into account? What orders were you following? You were the one who showed lack of discipline.\" \"I arrested a British terrorist spy.\" \"And what\u0027s the point of that? He\u0027s just one.\\n\\n They have plenty more.\\n\\n But, left to go free, he will lead us to others-perhaps many others.\\n\\n Your insubordination would have destroyed that chance.\\n\\n Fortunately for you, I saved you from a ghastly error.\" Weber looked sly.\\n\\n \"Certain people in authority would find it highly suspicious that you\u0027re so keen to free an Allied agent.\" Dieter sighed.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid.\\n\\n I\u0027m not some wretched Jewish shopkeeper, to be frightened by the threat of malicious gossip.\\n\\n You can\u0027t pretend I\u0027m a traitor, no one will believe you.\\n\\n Now, where are my men?\" \"The spy must be arrested immediately.\" \"No, he mustn\u0027t, and if you try I\u0027ll shoot you.\\n\\n Where are the men?\" \"I refuse to assign much-needed men to such an irresponsible task.\" \"You rejl~se?\" \"Yes.\" Dieter stared at him.\\n\\n He had not thought Weber brave enough or foolish enough to do this.\\n\\n \"What do you imagine will happen to you when the Field Marshal hears about this?\" Weber looked scared but defiant.\\n\\n \"I am not in the army,\" he said.\\n\\n \"This is the Gestapo.\" Unfortunately, he was right, Dieter thought despondently.\\n\\n It was all very well for Walter Goedel to order Dieter to use Gestapo personnel instead of taking much-needed fighting troops from the coast, but the Gestapo were not obliged to take orders from Dieter.\\n\\n The name of Rommel had frightened Weber for a while, but the effect had worn off And now Dieter was left with no staff but Lieutenant Hesse.\\n\\n Could he and Hans manage the shadowing of Helicopter without assistance? It would be difficult, but there was no alternative.\\n\\n He tried one more threat.\\n\\n \"Are you sure you\u0027re willing to bear the consequences of this refusal, Willi? You\u0027re going to get into the most dreadful trouble.\" \"On the contrary, I think it is you who are in trouble.\" Dieter shook his head in despair.\\n\\n There was no more to be said.\\n\\n He had already spent too much time arguing with this idiot.\\n\\n He went out.\\n\\n He met Hans in the hall and explained the situation.\\n\\n They went to the back of the chateau, where the engineering section was housed in the former servants\u0027 quarters.\\n\\n Last night Hans had arranged to borrow a PTT van and a moped, the kind of motorized bicycle whose small engine was started by pedaling.\\n\\n Dieter wondered whether Weber might have found out about the vehicles and ordered the engineers not to lend them.\\n\\n He hoped not: dawn was due in half an hour, and he did not have time for more arguments.\\n\\n But there was no trouble.\\n\\n Dieter and Hans put on overalls and drove away, with the moped in the back of the van.\\n\\n They went to Reims and drove along the rue du Bois.\\n\\n They parked around the corner and Hans walked back, in the faint light of dawn, and put the envelope containing the photo of Flick into the letter box.\\n\\n Helicopter\u0027s bedroom was at the back, so there was no serious risk that he might see Hans, and recognize him later.\\n\\n The sun was rising when they arrived outside Michel Clairet\u0027s house in the center of town.\\n\\n Hans parked a hundred meters down the road and opened a PTT manhole.\\n\\n He pretended to be working while watching the house.\\n\\n It was a busy street with numerous parked vehicles, so the van was not conspicuous.\\n\\n Dieter stayed in the van, keeping out of sight, brooding over the row with Weber.\\n\\n The man was stupid, but he had a point.\\n\\n Dieter was taking a dangerous risk.\\n\\n Helicopter could give him the slip and disappear.\\n\\n Then Dieter would have lost the thread.\\n\\n The safe and easy course would be to torture Helicopter.\\n\\n But though letting him go was risky, it promised rich rewards.\\n\\n If things went right, Helicopter could be solid gold.\\n\\n When Dieter thought of the triumph that hung just beyond his grasp, he lusted for it with a passion that made his pulse race.\\n\\n On the other hand, if things went wrong, Weber would make the most of it.\\n\\n He would tell everyone how he had opposed Dieter\u0027s risky plan.\\n\\n But Dieter would not allow himself to worry about such bureaucratic point-scoring.\\n\\n Men such as Weber, who played those games, were the most contemptible people on earth.\\n\\n The town came slowly to life.\\n\\n First to appear were the women walking to the bakery opposite Michel\u0027s house.\\n\\n The shop was closed, but they stood patiently outside, waiting and talking.\\n\\n Bread was rationed, but Dieter guessed it sometimes ran out anyway, so dutiful housewives shopped early to make sure they got their share.\\n\\n When eventually the doors opened, they all tried to get in at once-unlike German housewives, who would have formed an orderly queue, Dieter thought with a feeling of superiority.\\n\\n When he saw them come out with their loaves, he wished he had eaten some breakfast.\\n\\n After that, the working men appeared in their boots and berets, each carrying a bag or cheap fiber case containing his lunch.\\n\\n The children were just beginning to set out for school when Helicopter appeared, pedaling the bicycle that had belonged to Marie.\\n\\n Dieter sat upright.\\n\\n In the bicycle\u0027s basket was a rectangular object covered with a rag: the suitcase radio, Dieter guessed.\\n\\n Hans put his head up out of the manhole and watched.\\n\\n Helicopter went to Michel\u0027s door and knocked.\\n\\n There was no reply, of course.\\n\\n He stood on the step for a while, then looked in at the windows, then walked up and down the street looking for a back entrance.\\n\\n There was none, Dieter knew.\\n\\n Dieter had suggested to Helicopter what to do next.\\n\\n \"Go to the bar along the street, Chez Regis.\\n\\n Order coffee and rolls, and wait.\" Dieter\u0027s hope was that the Resistance might be watching Michel\u0027s house, alert for an emissary from London.\\n\\n He did not expect full-time surveillance, but perhaps a sympathetic neighbor might have agreed to keep an eye on the place.\\n\\n Helicopter\u0027s evident guilelessness would reassure such a watcher.\\n\\n Anyone could tell, just by the way he walked around, that he was not a Gestapo man or an agent of the Milice, the French security police.\\n\\n Dieter felt sure that somehow the Resistance would be alerted, and before\\n\\n too long someone would show up and speak to Helicopter-and that person might lead Dieter to the heart of the Resistance.\\n\\n A minute later Helicopter did as Dieter had suggested.\\n\\n He wheeled his bicycle along the street to the bar and sat at a pavement table, apparently enjoying the sunshine.\\n\\n He got a cup of coffee.\\n\\n It had to be ersatz, made with roasted grain, but he drank it with apparent relish.\\n\\n After twenty minutes or so he got another coffee and a newspaper from inside.\\n\\n He began to read the paper thoroughly.\\n\\n He had a patient air, as if he was prepared to wait all day.\\n\\n That was good.\\n\\n The morning wore on.\\n\\n Dieter began to wonder whether this was going to work.\\n\\n Maybe the Bollinger circuit had been so decimated by the slaughter at Sainte-Cecile that it was no longer operational, and there was no one left to perform even the most essential tasks.\\n\\n It would be a profound disappointment if Helicopter did not lead him to other terrorists.\\n\\n And it would please Weber no end.\\n\\n The time approached when Helicopter would have to order lunch to justify continuing to use the table.\\n\\n A waiter came out and spoke to him, then brought him a pastis.\\n\\n That, too, would be ersatz, made with a synthetic substitute for aniseed, but all the same Dieter licked his lips: he would have liked a drink.\\n\\n Another customer sat down at the table next to Helicopter\u0027s.\\n\\n There were five tables, and it would have been natural to take one farther away.\\n\\n Dieter\u0027s hopes rose.\\n\\n The newcomer was a long-limbed man in his thirties.\\n\\n He wore a blue chambray shirt and navy canvas trousers, but to Dieter\u0027s intuition he did not have the air of a workingman.\\n\\n He was something else, perhaps an artist who affected a proletarian look.\\n\\n He sat back in his chair and crossed his legs, resting his right ankle on his left knee, and the pose struck Dieter as familiar.\\n\\n Had he seen this man before? The waiter came out and the customer ordered some- thing.\\n\\n For a minute or so nothing happened.\\n\\n Was the man covertly studying Helicopter? Or just waiting for his drink? The waiter brought a glass of pale beer on a tray.\\n\\n The man took a long pull and wiped his mouth with a satisfied air.\\n\\n Dieter began to think gloomily that he was just a man with a thirst.\\n\\n But at the same time he felt he had seen that mouth-wiping gesture before.\\n\\n Then the newcomer spoke to Helicopter.\\n\\n Dieter tensed.\\n\\n Could this be what he had been waiting for? They exchanged a few casual words.\\n\\n Even at this distance, Dieter sensed that the newcomer had an engaging personality: Helicopter was smiling and talking with enthusiasm.\\n\\n After a few moments, Helicopter pointed to Michel\u0027s house, and Dieter guessed he was asking where the owner might be found.\\n\\n The other man gave a typical French shrug, and Dieter could imagine him saying, \"Me, I don\u0027t know.\" But Helicopter seemed to persist.\\n\\n The newcomer drained his beer glass, and Dieter had a flash of recollection.\\n\\n He suddenly knew exactly who this man was, and the realization so startled him that he jumped in his seat.\\n\\n He had seen the man in the square at Sainte-Cecile, at another cafeable, sitting with Flick Clairet, just before the skirmish-for this was her husband, Michel himself.\\n\\n \"Yes!\" Dieter said, and he thumped the dashboard with his fist in satisfaction.\\n\\n His strategy had been proved right-Helicopter had led him to the heart of the local Resistance.\\n\\n But he had not been expecting this degree of success.\\n\\n He had thought a messenger might come, and the messenger might take Helicopter-and Dieter-to Michel.\\n\\n Now Dieter had a dilemma.\\n\\n Michel was a very big prize.\\n\\n Should Dieter arrest him right away? Or follow him, in the hope of catching even bigger fish? Hans replaced the manhole cover and got into the van.\\n\\n \"Contact, sir?\" \"Yes.\" \"What next?\" Dieter did not know what to do next-arrest Michel, or follow him? Michel stood up, and Helicopter did the same.\\n\\n Dieter decided to follow them.\\n\\n \"What shall I do?\" Hans said anxiously.\\n\\n \"Get out the bike, quick.\" Hans opened the back doors of the van and took out the moped.\\n\\n The two men put money on the cafeables and moved away.\\n\\n Dieter saw that Michel walked with a limp, and recalled that he had taken a bullet during the skirmish.\\n\\n He said to Hans, \"You follow them, I\u0027ll follow you.\" He started the engine of the van.\\n\\n Hans climbed on the moped and started pedaling, which fired the engine.\\n\\n He drove slowly along the street, keeping a hundred meters behind his quarry.\\n\\n Dieter followed Hans.\\n\\n Michel and Helicopter turned a corner.\\n\\n Following a minute later, Dieter saw that they had stopped to look in a shop window.\\n\\n It was a pharmacy.\\n\\n They were not shopping for medicines, of course: this was a precaution against surveillance.\\n\\n As Dieter drove by, they turned and headed back the way they had come.\\n\\n They would be watching for a vehicle that made a U-turn, so Dieter could not pursue them.\\n\\n However, he saw Hans pull behind a truck and turn back, remaining on the far side of the street but keeping the two men in sight.\\n\\n Dieter went around the block and caught up with them again.\\n\\n Michel and Helicopter were approaching the railway station, with Hans still following.\\n\\n Dieter asked himself whether they knew they were being followed.\\n\\n The trick at the pharmacy might indicate that they were suspicious.\\n\\n He did not think they had noticed the PTJ\u0027 van, for he had been out of their sight most of the time, but they could have spotted the moped.\\n\\n Most likely, Dieter thought, the reversal of direction was a precaution taken routinely by Michel, who was presumably an experienced undercover operator.\\n\\n The two men crossed the gardens in front of the station.\\n\\n There were no flowers in the beds, but a few trees were blossoming in defiance of the war.\\n\\n The station was a solidly classical building with pilasters and pediments, heavyweight and over decorated, no doubt like the nineteenth-century businessmen who had built it.\\n\\n What would Dieter do if Michel and Helicopter caught a train? It was too risky for Dieter to get on the same train.\\n\\n Helicopter would certainly recognize him, and it was even possible that Michel might remember him from the square at Samte-Cecile.\\n\\n No, Hans would have to board the train, and Dieter would follow by road.\\n\\n They entered the station through one of three classical arches.\\n\\n Hans left his moped and followed them inside.\\n\\n Dieter pulled up and did the same.\\n\\n If the two men went to the booking office, he would tell Hans to stand behind them in the queue and buy a ticket to the same destination.\\n\\n They were not at the ticket window.\\n\\n Dieter entered the station just in time to see Hans go down a flight of steps to the tunnel beneath the lines that connected the platforms.\\n\\n Perhaps Michel had bought tickets in advance, Dieter thought.\\n\\n That was not a problem.\\n\\n Hans would just get on the train without a ticket.\\n\\n On either side of the tunnel, steps led up to the platforms.\\n\\n Dieter followed Hans past all the platform entrances.\\n\\n Sensing danger, he quickened his pace as he mounted the stairs to the station\u0027s rear entrance.\\n\\n He caught up with Hans and they emerged together into the rue de Courcelles.\\n\\n Several of the buildings had been bombed recently, but cars were parked on those stretches of the road that were clear of rubble.\\n\\n Dieter scanned the street, fear leaping in his chest.\\n\\n A hundred meters away, Michel and Helicopter were jumping into a black car.\\n\\n Dieter and Hans would never catch them.\\n\\n Dieter put his hand on his gun, but the range was too great for a pistol.\\n\\n The car pulled away.\\n\\n It was a black Renault Monaquatre, one of the commonest cars in France.\\n\\n Dieter could not read its license plate.\\n\\n It tore off along the street and turned a corner.\\n\\n Dieter cursed.\\n\\n It was a simple ploy but infallible.\\n\\n By entering the tunnel, they had forced their pursuers to abandon their vehicles; then they had a car waiting at the other side, enabling them to escape.\\n\\n They might not even have detected their shadows: like the change of direction outside the pharmacy, the tunnel trick had probably been a routine precaution.\\n\\n Dieter sank into gloom.\\n\\n He had gambled and lost.\\n\\n Weber would be overjoyed.\\n\\n \"What do we do now?\" said Hans.\\n\\n \"Go back to Sainte-Cecile.\" They returned to the van, put the moped in the back, and drove to headquarters.\\n\\n Dieter had just one ray of hope.\\n\\n He knew Helicopter\u0027s times for radio contact, and the frequencies assigned to him.\\n\\n That information might yet be used to recapture him.\\n\\n The Gestapo had a sophisticated system, developed and refined throughout the war, for detecting illicit broadcasts and following them to their source.\\n\\n Many Allied agents had been captured that way.\\n\\n As British training improved, so the wireless operators had adopted better security precautions, always broadcasting from a different location, never staying on air longer than fifteen minutes; but careless ones could still be caught.\\n\\n Would the British suspect that Helicopter had been found out? Helicopter would by now be giving Michel a full account of his adventures.\\n\\n Michel would question him closely about the arrest in the cathedral and subsequent escape.\\n\\n He would be particularly interested in the newcomer codenamed Charenton.\\n\\n However, he would have no reason to suspect that Mademoiselle Lemas was not who she claimed to be.\\n\\n Michel had never met her, so he would not be alerted even if Helicopter happened to mention that she was an attractive young redhead rather than a middle-aged spinster.\\n\\n And Helicopter had no idea that his one-time pad and his silk handkerchief had been meticulously copied out by Stephanie, or that his frequencies had been noted-from the yellow wax crayon marks on the dials-by Dieter.\\n\\n Perhaps, Dieter began to think, all was not yet lost.\\n\\n When they got back to the chateau, Dieter ran into Weber in the hallway.\\n\\n Weber looked hard at him and said, \"Have you lost him?\" Jackals can smell blood, Dieter thought.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he admitted.\\n\\n It was beneath his dignity to lie to Weber.\\n\\n \"Ha!\" Weber was triumphant.\\n\\n \"You should leave such work to the experts.\" \"Very well, then I shall,\" Dieter said.\\n\\n Weber looked surprised.\\n\\n Dieter went on, \"He\u0027s due to broadcast to England at eight o\u0027clock tonight.\\n\\n Here\u0027s your chance to prove your expertise.\\n\\n Show how good you are.\\n\\n Track him down.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws/page-22.html","bookId":2681,"book":{"id":2681,"title":"Jackdaws","description":"Storyline: In his own bestselling tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca, Ken Follett once again strikes Nazi pay dirt as a gang of all-female saboteurs go behind German lines.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/jackdaws.jpg","author":"Ken Follett","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/jackdaws.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:08:29 AM"}}
