{"id":29794,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4 A Short Cut to Mushrooms","content":"In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He jumped up and went out. Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves. \u0027They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Come and have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.\u0027 Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. \u0027What is the plan for today?\u0027 asked Pippin. \u0027To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,\u0027 answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food. \u0027Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?\u0027 asked Pippin cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him. \u0027Yes, probably,\u0027 said Frodo, not liking the reminder. \u0027But I hope to get across the river without their seeing us.\u0027 \u0027Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?\u0027 \u0027Not much . only hints and riddles,\u0027 said Frodo evasively. \u0027Did you ask about the sniffing?\u0027 \u0027We didn\u0027t discuss it,\u0027 said Frodo with his mouth full. \u0027You should have. I am sure it is very important.\u0027 \u0027In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,\u0027 said Frodo sharply. \u0027And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don\u0027t want to answer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!\u0027 \u0027Good heavens!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027At breakfast?\u0027 He walked away towards the edge of the green. From Frodo\u0027s mind the bright morning . treacherously bright, he thought . had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing. \u0027No! I could not!\u0027 he said to himself. \u0027It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is quite another . even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don\u0027t think I ought even to take Sam.\u0027 He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. \u0027Well, Sam!\u0027 he said. \u0027What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can . in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.\u0027 \u0027Very good, sir!\u0027 \u0027You still mean to come with me?\u0027 \u0027I do.\u0027 \u0027It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. \u0027It is already dangerous. Most likely neither of us will come back.\u0027 \u0027If you don\u0027t come back, sir, then I shan\u0027t, that\u0027s certain,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Don\u0027t you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black Rulers try to stop him, they\u0027ll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They laughed.\u0027 \u0027Who are they, and what are you talking about?\u0027 \u0027The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know you were going away, so I didn\u0027t see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!\u0027 \u0027They are,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?\u0027 \u0027They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,\u0027 answered Sam slowly. \u0027It don\u0027t seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite different from what I expected . so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.\u0027 Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful. \u0027Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now . now that your wish to see them has come true already?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Yes, sir. I don\u0027t know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can\u0027t turn back. It isn\u0027t to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want . I don\u0027t rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.\u0027 Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. \u0027All ready to start?\u0027 he said as Pippin ran up. \u0027We must be getting off at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.\u0027 \u0027You slept late, you mean,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027I was up long before; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.\u0027 \u0027I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.\u0027 \u0027Then you are going to fly,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027You won\u0027t cut straight on foot anywhere in this country.\u0027 \u0027We can cut straighter than the road anyway,\u0027 answered Frodo. \u0027The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.\u0027 \u0027Short cuts make long delays,\u0027 argued Pippin. \u0027The country is rough round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can\u0027t see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field.\u0027 \u0027It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,\u0027 answered Frodo. \u0027And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.\u0027 \u0027All right!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027I will follow you into every bog and ditch. But it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time since I tasted it.\u0027 \u0027That settles it!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Short cuts make delays, but inns make longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?\u0027 \u0027I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam (in spite of private misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). \u0027Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let\u0027s go now!\u0027 said Pippin. It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering what to do. \u0027First check!\u0027 said Pippin, smiling grimly. Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. \u0027Look!\u0027 he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside it stooped a black figure. They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. \u0027Whew!\u0027 he said to Pippin. \u0027We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we got under cover only just in time. You\u0027ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?\u0027 They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but there was no sound of pursuit. \u0027I don\u0027t fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027But I guess he knows we came down it. We had better be going on.\u0027 Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish and the River. \u0027Why, this is the Stock-brook!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027If we are going to try and get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.\u0027 They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. After half an hour Pippin said: \u0027I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad belt -I should have said no more than a mile at the widest . and we ought to have been through it by now.\u0027 \u0027It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027That won\u0027t mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to come out into the open yet.\u0027 They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them. Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves. \u0027And what do you think that was?\u0027 Pippin asked at last, trying to speak lightly, but quavering a little. \u0027If it was a bird, it was one that I never heard in the Shire before.\u0027 \u0027It was not bird or beast,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027It was a call, or a signal . there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit has such a voice.\u0027 No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off. Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they could. At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into well- tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind. They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped. \u0027I know these fields and this gate!\u0027 he said. \u0027This is Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot\u0027s land. That\u0027s his farm away there in the trees.\u0027 \u0027One trouble after another!\u0027 said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon\u0027s den. The others looked at him in surprise. \u0027What\u0027s wrong with old Maggot?\u0027 asked Pippin. \u0027He\u0027s a good friend to all the Brandy bucks. Of course he\u0027s a terror to trespassers, and keeps ferocious dogs . but after all, folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard.\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But all the same,\u0027 he added with a shamefaced laugh, \u0027I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and then took me and showed me to his dogs. \"See, lads,\" he said, \"next time this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!\" They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright . though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have touched me.\u0027 Pippin laughed. \u0027Well, it\u0027s time you made it up. Especially if you are coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow . if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let\u0027s get into the lane and then we shan\u0027t be trespassing. If we meet him, I\u0027ll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry\u0027s, and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.\u0027 They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane. Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, and a loud voice was heard shouting: \u0027Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!\u0027 Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling. Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. \u0027Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be wanting?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!\u0027 said Pippin. The farmer looked at him closely. \u0027Well, if it isn\u0027t Master Pippin . Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!\u0027 he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. \u0027It\u0027s a long time since I saw you round here. It\u0027s lucky for you that I know you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times. Too near the River,\u0027 he said, shaking his head. \u0027But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won\u0027t cross my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.\u0027 \u0027What fellow do you mean?\u0027 asked Pippin. \u0027Then you haven\u0027t seen him?\u0027 said the farmer. \u0027He went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and asking funny questions. But perhaps you\u0027ll come along inside, and we\u0027ll pass the news more comfortable. I\u0027ve a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your friends are willing, Mr. Took.\u0027 It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. \u0027What about the dogs?\u0027 asked Frodo anxiously. The farmer laughed. \u0027They won\u0027t harm you . not unless I tell \u0027em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Heel, Wolf!\u0027 To the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. \u0027Mr. Frodo Baggins,\u0027 he said. \u0027You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.\u0027 At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the arm. \u0027Well, if that isn\u0027t queerer than ever?\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027Mr. Baggins is it? Come inside! We must have a talk.\u0027 They went into the farmer\u0027s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however long ago. After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and looked at them all in turn. \u0027Now, Mr. Peregrin,\u0027 he said, \u0027where might you be coming from, and where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit\u0027 me? For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.\u0027 \u0027Well, no,\u0027 answered Pippin. \u0027To tell you the truth, since you have guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.\u0027 \u0027If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,\u0027 said the farmer. \u0027But I wasn\u0027t worrying about that. You have leave to walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins . though I daresay you still like mushrooms.\u0027 He laughed. \u0027Ah yes, I recognized the name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals of Buckland. But it wasn\u0027t mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that funny customer asked me?\u0027 They waited anxiously for him to go on. \u0027Well,\u0027 the farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, \u0027he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want to be known. \"Now what in the Shire can he want?\" I thought to myself. We don\u0027t see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow. \u0027 \"Good-day to you!\" I says, going out to him. \"This lane don\u0027t lead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to the road.\" I didn\u0027t like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. \u0027 \"I come from yonder,\" he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over my fields, if you please. \"Have you seen Baggins?\" he asked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold. \u0027 \"Be off!\" I said. \"There are no Bagginses here. You\u0027re in the wrong part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton . but you can go by road this time.\" \u0027 \"Baggins has left,\" he answered in a whisper. \"He is coming. He is not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come back with gold.\" \u0027 \"No you won\u0027t,\" I said. \"You\u0027ll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.\" \u0027He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do you think of that?\u0027 Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the Ferry. \u0027I don\u0027t know what to think,\u0027 he said at last. \u0027Then I\u0027ll tell you what to think,\u0027 said Maggot. \u0027You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up there.\u0027 Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye. \u0027But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo\u0027s. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?\u0027 Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting. \u0027Well, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 Maggot went on, \u0027I\u0027m glad that you\u0027ve had the sense to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don\u0027t get mixed up with these outlandish folk. You\u0027ll have friends in these parts. If any of these black fellows come after you again, I\u0027ll deal with them. I\u0027ll say you\u0027re dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.\u0027 \u0027Maybe you\u0027re right,\u0027 said Frodo, avoiding the farmer\u0027s eye and staring at the fire. Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. \u0027Well, I see you have ideas of your own,\u0027 he said. \u0027It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it won\u0027t be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?\u0027 \u0027I was thinking so,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But we have got to try and get there; and it won\u0027t be done by sitting and thinking. So I am afraid we must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I\u0027ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh to hear it. It\u0027s a pity: for I\u0027ve missed a good friend. And now I\u0027m sorry to leave so soon. But I\u0027ll come back, perhaps, one day . if I get a chance.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll be welcome when you come,\u0027 said Maggot. \u0027But now I\u0027ve a notion. It\u0027s near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!\u0027 \u0027And so should we!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But we must be going at once, I\u0027m afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.\u0027 \u0027Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I\u0027ll gel out a small waggon, and I\u0027ll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.\u0027 Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. Two of Maggot\u0027s sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in and out. One or two other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. They threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the driving- seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door. \u0027You be careful of yourself. Maggot!\u0027 she called. \u0027Don\u0027t go arguing with any foreigners, and come straight back!\u0027 \u0027I will!\u0027 said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the high- banked causeway. Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging above the dikes, and crawling over the fields. \u0027It\u0027s going to be thick,\u0027 said Maggot; \u0027but I\u0027ll not light my lantern till I turn for home. We\u0027ll hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight.\u0027 It was five miles or more from Maggot\u0027s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies\u0027 hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them. Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies\u0027 heads, and peering forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. \u0027You\u0027d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam anxiously. \u0027You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we\u0027ll send this rider to the rightabouts!\u0027 He climbed out and went to the farmer\u0027s side. Black Riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon. Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them. \u0027Hallo there!\u0027 called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard or two ahead. \u0027Now then!\u0027 said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward. \u0027Don\u0027t you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where are you going?\u0027 \u0027I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?\u0027 said a muffled voice . but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. \u0027Mr. Merry!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?\u0027 said Merry coming forward. As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. \u0027So there you are at last!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I\u0027m blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In your duck- pond?\u0027 \u0027No, I caught \u0027em trespassing,\u0027 said the farmer, \u0027and nearly set my dogs on \u0027em; but they\u0027ll tell you all the story, I\u0027ve no doubt. Now, if you\u0027ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I\u0027d best be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.\u0027 He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. \u0027Well, good night to you all,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s been a queer day, and no mistake. But all\u0027s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors. I\u0027ll not deny that I\u0027ll be glad now when I do.\u0027 He lit his lanterns, and got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. \u0027I was nearly forgetting,\u0027 he said. \u0027Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.\u0027 He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of thanks and good-nights. They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/49/3234.html","bookId":744,"book":{"id":744,"title":"The Fellowship Of The Ring护戒使者","description":"简介： The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel The Lord of the Rings by the English author J.
