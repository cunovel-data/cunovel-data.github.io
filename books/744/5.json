{"id":29795,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 A Conspiracy Unmasked","content":"\u0027Now we had better get home ourselves,\u0027 said Merry. There\u0027s something funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.\u0027\\n\\n They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the water\u0027s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.\\n\\n Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.\\n\\n Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew and grew, and after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.\\n\\n The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim.\\n\\n Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the Shire.\\n\\n The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone on living quietly at Bag End.\\n\\n The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:\\n\\n \u0027Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?\u0027\\n\\n On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.\\n\\n \u0027What in the Shire is that?\u0027 exclaimed Merry.\\n\\n \u0027Something that is following us,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But don\u0027t ask any more now! Let\u0027s get away at once!\u0027 They hurried up the path to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen.\\n\\n \u0027Thank goodness you don\u0027t keep any boats on the west-bank!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Can horses cross the river?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge . or they might swim,\u0027 answered Merry. \u0027Though I never heard of any horse swimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you later. Let\u0027s get indoors and then we can talk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I\u0027ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We\u0027ll see about supper and things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,\u0027 said Frodo; \u0027but we could do with another.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You shall have it! Give me that basket!\u0027 said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness.\\n\\n It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo\u0027s new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down into the country.\\n\\n At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old- fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.\\n\\n As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house.\\n\\n \u0027Well, what do you think of it?\u0027 asked Merry coming up the passage. \u0027We have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite things . or Bilbo\u0027s things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling) . were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very night, before they all went to bed.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s delightful!\u0027 he said with an effort. \u0027I hardly feel that I have moved at all.\u0027\\n\\n The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.\\n\\n \u0027A bath!\u0027 cried Pippin. \u0027O blessed Meriadoc!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which order shall we go in?\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Eldest first, or quickest first? You\u0027ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trust me to arrange things better than that!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027We can\u0027t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!\u0027\\n\\n Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo\u0027s favourite bath-songs.\\n\\n There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. It appeared that a lot of Pippin\u0027s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.\\n\\n Merry went to the door: \u0027What about supper and beer in the throat?\u0027 he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s so much water in the air that I\u0027m coming into the kitchen to finish,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Lawks!\u0027 said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. \u0027You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,\u0027 he said. \u0027Hurry up, or we shan\u0027t wait for you.\u0027\\n\\n They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. \u0027I suppose you three won\u0027t want mushrooms again?\u0027 said Fredegar without much hope.\\n\\n \u0027Yes we shall!\u0027 cried Pippin.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re mine!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers\u0027 wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I\u0027ll serve them.\u0027\\n\\n Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo\u0027s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drew chairs round the fire.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll clear up later,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Now tell me all about it! I guess that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was scared, if that is possible.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have all been scared,\u0027 said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. \u0027You would have been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what are they?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Black figures riding on black horses,\u0027 answered Pippin. \u0027If Frodo won\u0027t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.\u0027 He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.\\n\\n \u0027I should think you were making it all up,\u0027 said Merry, \u0027if I had not seen that black shape on the landing-stage . and heard the queer sound in Maggot\u0027s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Cousin Frodo has been very close,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027But the time has come for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than Farmer Maggot\u0027s guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo\u0027s treasure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was only a guess,\u0027 said Frodo hastily. \u0027Maggot does not know anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027A lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk. I\u0027ve heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think,\u0027 answered Frodo slowly, \u0027that it was a good guess, as far as it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo\u0027s old adventures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe here or anywhere else.\u0027 He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s coming out in a minute,\u0027 whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Well!\u0027 said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision. \u0027I can\u0027t keep it dark any longer. I have got something to tell you all. But I don\u0027t know quite how to begin.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I could help you,\u0027 said Merry quietly, \u0027by telling you some of it myself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. \u0027Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don\u0027t know how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once. And you don\u0027t want to. We are very sorry for you.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed. \u0027Dear old Frodo!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard you muttering: \"Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder\", and things like that. And pretending that you had come to the end of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville- Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good heavens!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027I thought I had been both careful and clever. I don\u0027t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my departure then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh no!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027Don\u0027t worry about that! The secret won\u0027t keep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I must go,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do not understand!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027You must go . and therefore we must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon\u0027s throat to save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My dear and most beloved hobbits!\u0027 said Frodo deeply moved. \u0027But I could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course we understand,\u0027 said Merry firmly. \u0027That is why we have decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Ring!\u0027 said Frodo, now completely amazed.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, the Ring,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027My dear old hobbit, you don\u0027t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring for years . before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was also more careful . but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Go on!\u0027 said Frodo faintly.\\n\\n \u0027It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.\\n\\n \u0027After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow\u0027s secret book.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You have read his book!\u0027 cried Frodo. \u0027Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not too safe, I should say,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027But I have only had one rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, Frodo?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, as I was saying,\u0027 Merry proceeded, \u0027I kept my knowledge to myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where is he?\u0027 said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.\\n\\n \u0027Step forward, Sam!\u0027 said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears. \u0027Here\u0027s our collector of information! And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sam!\u0027 cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense, mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! lake someone as you can trust.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,\u0027 said Frodo. Sam looked at him unhappily. \u0027It all depends on what you want,\u0027 put in Merry. \u0027You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin . to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours . closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid . but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And after all, sir,\u0027 added Sam, \u0027you did ought to take the Elves\u0027 advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can\u0027t deny it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t deny it,\u0027 said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. \u0027I don\u0027t deny it, but I\u0027ll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.\\n\\n \u0027You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!\u0027 he said, turning to the others. \u0027But bless you!\u0027 he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, \u0027I give in. I will take Gildor\u0027s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good! That\u0027s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!\u0027 they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.\\n\\n It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:\\n\\n \u0027Very good!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed . under a roof, for tonight at any rate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh! That was poetry!\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027Do you really mean to start before the break of day?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 answered Frodo. \u0027I fear those Black Riders, and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two things. How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The answer to the second question,\u0027 said Merry, \u0027is that we could get off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,\u0027 answered Merry. \u0027They could have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the river-bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall . for they would not like the look of the Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo sat for a while in thought. \u0027I have made up my mind,\u0027 he said finally. \u0027I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the North- gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don\u0027t know how many there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!\u0027 said Fredegar horrified. \u0027You can\u0027t be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as Black Riders.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not quite,\u0027 said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. With luck we might gel a considerable start.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you won\u0027t have any luck in the Old Forest,\u0027 objected Fredegar. \u0027No one ever has luck in there. You\u0027ll gel lost. People don\u0027t go in there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes they do!\u0027 said Merry. \u0027The Brandybucks go in . occasionally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, do as you think best!\u0027 said Fredegar. \u0027I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.\u0027\\n\\n Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo\u0027s to help him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.\\n\\n \u0027Excellent!\u0027 said Frodo, when he understood the plan. \u0027We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don\u0027t know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s that,\u0027 said Pippin. \u0027On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty\u0027s . waiting here till Black Riders come.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You wait till you are well inside the Forest,\u0027 said Fredegar. \u0027You\u0027ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s no good arguing about it any more,\u0027 said Merry. \u0027We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.\u0027\\n\\n When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out sooner or later.\\n\\n Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/49/3235.html","bookId":744,"book":{"id":744,"title":"The Fellowship Of The Ring护戒使者","description":"简介： The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes of the epic novel The Lord of the Rings by the English author J.
