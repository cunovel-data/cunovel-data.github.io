{"id":37443,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"\"THE STRENGTH OF THE vampire is that no one will believe in him.\"\\n\\n Thank you, Dr. Van Helsing, he thought, putting down his copy Of \"Dracula.\" He sat staring moodily at the bookcase, listening to Brahms\u0027 second piano concerto, a whisky sour in his right hand, a cigarette between his lips.\\n\\n It was true. The book was a hodgepodge of superstitions and soap-opera clichés, but that line was true; no one had believed in them, and how could they fight something they didn\u0027t even believe in?\\n\\n That was what the situation had been. Something black and of the night had come crawling out of the Middle Ages. Something with no framework or credulity, something that had been consigned, fact and figure, to the pages of imaginative literature. Vampires were passé; Summers\u0027 idylls or Stoker\u0027s melodramatics or a brief inclusion in the Britannica or grist for the pulp writer\u0027s mill or raw material for the B-film factories. A tenuous legend passed from century to century.\\n\\n Well, it was true.\\n\\n He took a sip from his drink and closed his eyes as the cold liquid trickled down his throat and warmed his stomach. True, he thought, but no one ever got the chance to know it. Oh, they knew it was something, but it couldn\u0027t be that—not that. That was imagination, that was superstition, there was no such thing as that.\\n\\n And, before science had caught up with the legend, the legend had swallowed science and everything.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t found any doweling that day. He hadn\u0027t checked the generator. He hadn\u0027t cleaned up the pieces of mirror. He hadn\u0027t eaten supper; he\u0027d lost his appetite. That wasn\u0027t hard. He lost it most of the time. He couldn\u0027t do the things he\u0027d done all afternoon and then come home to a hearty meal. Not even after five months.\\n\\n He thought of the eleven—no, the twelve children that afternoon, and he finished his drink in two swallows.\\n\\n He blinked and the room wavered a little before him. You\u0027re getting blotto, Father, he told himself. So what? he returned. Has anyone more right?\\n\\n He tossed the book across the room. Begone, Van Helsing and Mina and Jonathan and blood-eyed Count and all! All figments, all driveling extrapolations on a somber theme.\\n\\n A coughing chuckle emptied itself from his throat. Outside, Ben Cortman called for him to come out. Be right out, Benny, he thought. Soon as I get my tuxedo on.\\n\\n He shuddered. and gritted his teeth edges together. Be right out. Well; why not? Why not go out? It was a sure way to be free of them.\\n\\n Be one of them.\\n\\n He chuckled at the simplicity of it, then shoved himself up and walked crookedly to the bar. Why not? His mind plodded on. Why go through all this complexity when a flung open door and a few steps would end it all?\\n\\n For the life of him, he didn\u0027t know. There was, of course, the faint possibility that others like him existed somewhere, trying to go on, hoping that someday they would be among their own kind again. But how could he ever find them if they weren\u0027t within a day\u0027s drive of his house?\\n\\n He shrugged and poured more whisky in the glass; he\u0027d given up the use of jiggers months ago. Garlic on the windows, and nets over the hothouse and burn the bodies and cart the rocks away and, fraction of an inch by fraction of an inch, reduce their unholy numbers. Why kid himself? He\u0027d never find anyone else.\\n\\n His body dropped down heavily on the chair. Here we are, kiddies, sitting like a bug in a rug, snugly, surrounded by a battalion of blood-suckers who wish no more than to sip freely of my bonded, 100-proof hemoglobin. Have a drink, men, this one\u0027s really on me.\\n\\n His face twisted into an expression of raw, unqualified hatred. Bastards! I\u0027ll kill every, mother\u0027s son of you before I\u0027ll give in! His right hand closed like a clamp and the glass shattered in his grip.\\n\\n He looked down, dull-eyed, at the fragments on the floor, at the jagged piece of glass still in his hand, at the whisky-diluted blood dripping off his palm.\\n\\n Wouldn\u0027t they like to get some of it, though? he. thought. He started up with a furious lurch and almost opened the door so he could wave the hand in their faces and hear them howl.\\n\\n Then he closed his eyes and a shudder ran through his body. Wise up, buddy, he thought. Go bandage your goddamn hand.\\n\\n He stumbled into the bathroom and washed his hand carefully, gasping as he daubed iodine into the sliced-open flesh. Then he bandaged it clumsily, his broad chest rising and falling with jerky movements, sweat dripping from his forehead. I need a cigarette, he thought.\\n\\n In the living room again, he changed Brahms for Bernstein and lit a cigarette. What will I do if I ever run out of coffin nails? he wondered, looking at the cigarette\u0027s blue trailing smoke. Well, there wasn\u0027t much chance of that. He had about a thousand cartons in the closet of Kathy\u0027s—He clenched his teeth together. In the closet of the larder, the larder, the larder.\\n\\n Kathy\u0027s room.\\n\\n He sat staring with dead eyes at the mural while \"The Age of Anxiety\" pulsed in his ears. Age of anxiety, he mused. You thought you had anxiety, Lenny boy. Lenny and Benny; you two should meet. Composer, meet corpse. Mamma, when I grow up I wanna be a wampir like Dada.\\n\\n Why, bless you, boo, of course you shall.\\n\\n The whisky gurgled into the `glass. He grimaced a little at the pain in his hand and shifted the bottle to his left hand.\\n\\n He sat down and sipped. Let the jagged edge of sobriety be now dulled, he thought. Let the crumby balance of clear vision be expunged, but post haste. I hate `em.\\n\\n Gradually the room shifted on its gyroscopic center and wove and undulated about his chair. A pleasant haze, fuzzy at the edges, took over sight He looked at the glass, at the record player. He let his head flop from side to side. Outside, they prowled and muttered and waited.\\n\\n Poor vampires, he thought, poor little cusses, pussyfootin\u0027 round my house, so thirsty, so all forlorn.\\n\\n A thought. He raised a forefinger that wavered before his eyes.\\n\\n Friends, I come before you to discuss the vampire; a minority element if there ever was one, and there was one.\\n\\n But to concision: I will sketch out the basis for my thesis, which thesis is this: Vampires are prejudiced against.\\n\\n The keynote of minority prejudice is this: They are loathed because they are feared. Thus\\n\\n He made himself a drink. A long one.\\n\\n At one time, the Dark and Middle Ages, to be succinct, the vampire\u0027s power was great, the fear of him tremendous. He was anathema and still remains anathema. Society hates him without ration.\\n\\n But are his needs any more shocking than the needs of other animals and men? Are his deeds more outrageous than the deeds of the parent who drained the spirit from his child? The vampire may foster quickened heartbeats and levitated hair. But is he worse than the parent who gave to society a neurotic child who became a politician? Is he worse than `the manufacturer who set up belated foundations with the money he made by handing bombs and guns to suicidal nationalists? Is he worse than the distiller who gave bastardized grain juice to stultify further the brains of those who, sober, were incapable of a progressive thought? (Nay, I apologize for this calumny; I nip the brew that feeds me.) Is he worse, then, than the publisher who filled ubiquitous racks with lust and death wishes? Really, now, search your soul; lovie—is the vampire so bad?\\n\\n All he does is drink blood.\\n\\n Why, then, this unkind prejudice, this thoughtless bias? Why cannot the vampire live where he chooses? Why must he seek out hiding places where none can find him out? Why do you wish him destroyed? Ah, see, you have turned the poor guileless innocent into a haunted animal. He has no means of support, no measures for proper education, he has not the, voting franchise No wonder he is compelled to seek out a predatory nocturnal existence;\\n\\n Robert Neville grunted a surly grunt. Sure, sure, he thought, but would you let your sister marry one?\\n\\n He shrugged. You got me there, buddy, you got me there.\\n\\n The music ended. The needle scratched back and forth in the black grooves. He sat there, feeling a chill creeping up his legs. That\u0027s what was wrong with drinking too much. You became immune to drunken delights. There was no solace in liquor. Before you got happy, you collapsed. Already the room was straightening out, the sounds outside were starting to nibble at his eardrums..\\n\\n \"Come out, Neville!\"\\n\\n His throat moved and a shaking breath passed his lips. Come out. The women were out there, their dresses open or taken off, their flesh waiting for his touch, their lips waiting for—My blood, my blood!\\n\\n As if it were someone else\u0027s hand, he watched his whitened fist rise up slowly, shuddering, to drive down on his leg. The pain made him suck in a breath of the house\u0027s stale air. Garlic. Everywhere the smell of garlic. In his clothes and in the furniture and in his food and even in his drink. Have a garlic and soda; his mind rattled out the attempted joke.\\n\\n He lurched up and started pacing. What am I going to do now? Go through the routine again? I\u0027ll save you the trouble. Reading - drinking - soundproof the house - the women. The women, the lustful, bloodthirsty, naked women flaunting their hot bodies at him. No, not that.\\n\\n .A shuddering whine wrenched up through his chest and throat. Goddamn them, what were they waiting for? Did they think he was going to come out and hand himself over?\\n\\n Maybe I am, maybe I am. He actually found himself jerking off the crossbar from the door. Coming, girls, I\u0027m coming. Wet your lips, now.\\n\\n Outside, they heard the bar being lifted, and a howl of anticipation sounded in the night.\\n\\n Spinning, he drove his fists one after the, other into the wall until he\u0027d cracked the plaster and broken his skin; Then he stood there trembling helplessly, his teeth chattering.\\n\\n After a while it passed. He put the bar back across the door and went into the bedroom. He sank down, on the bed and fell back on\u0027 the pillow with a groan. His left hand beat once, feebly, on the bedspread.\\n\\n Oh, God, he thought, how long, how long?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/376/981.html","bookId":308,"book":{"id":308,"title":"我是传奇 I Am Legend","description":"简介： 《我是传奇》（I Am Legend）是一部于2007年上映的末世科幻电影，由法兰西斯罗伦斯（Francis Lawrence）执导，威尔史密斯主演。电影根据李察麦森（Richard Matheson）的同名小说改编，也是该...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110909/1-110Z9151S9421.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/376","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
