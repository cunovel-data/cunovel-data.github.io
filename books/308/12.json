{"id":37452,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"THE NEXT DAY STANK.\n The sun lamp killed the germs on the slide, but that didn\u0027t explain anything to him.\n He mixed allyl sulphide with the germ-ridden blood and nothing happened. The allyl sulphide was absorbed, the germs still lived.\n He paced nervously around the bedroom.\n Garlic kept them away and blood was the fulcrum of their existence. Yet, mix the essence of garlic with the blood and nothing happened. His hands closed into angry fists.\n Wait a minute; that blood was from one of the living ones.\n An hour later he had a sample of the other kind. He mixed it with allyl sulphide and looked at it through the microscope. Nothing happened.\n Lunch stuck in his throat.\n What about the stake, then? All he could think of was hemorrhage, and he knew it wasn\u0027t that. That damned woman!\n He tried half the afternoon to think of something concrete. Finally, with a snarl, he knocked the microscope over and stalked into the living room. He thudded down onto the chair and sat there, tapping impatient fingers on the arm.\n Brilliant, Neville, he thought. You\u0027re uncanny. Go to the head of the class. He sat there, biting a knuckle. Let\u0027s face it, he thought miserably, I lost my mind a long time ago. I can\u0027t think two days in succession without having seams come loose. I\u0027m useless, worthless, without value, a dud.\n All right, he replied with a shrug, that settles it. Let\u0027s get back to the problem. So he did.\n There are certain things established, he lectured himself. There is a germ, it\u0027s transmitted, sunlight kills it, garlic is effective. Some vampires sleep in soil, the stake destroys them. They don\u0027t turn into wolves or bats, but certain animals acquire the germ and become vampires.\n All right.\n He made a list. One column he headed \"Bacilli,\" the other he headed with a question mark.\n He began.\n The cross. No, that couldn\u0027t have anything to do with the bacilli. If anything, it was psychological.\n The soil. Could there be something in the soil that affected the germ? No. How would it get in the blood stream? Besides, very few of them slept in the soil.\n His throat moved as he added the second item to the column headed by a question mark.\n Running water. Could it be absorbed porously and...\n No, that was stupid. They came out in the rain, and they wouldn\u0027t if it harmed them. Another notation in the right-hand column. His hand shook a little as he entered it.\n Sunlight. He tried vainly to glean satisfaction from putting down one item in the desired column.\n The stake. No. His throat moved. Watch it, he warned. The mirror. For God\u0027s sake, how could a mirror have anything to do with germs? His hasty scrawl in the right-hand column was hardly legible. His hand shook a little more.\n Garlic. He sat there, teeth gritted. He had to add at least one more item to the bacilli column; it was almost a point of honor. He struggled over the last item. Garlic, garlic. It must affect the germ. But how?\n He started to write in the right-hand column, but before he could finish, fury came from far down like lava shooting up to the crest of a volcano.\n Damn!\n He crumpled the paper into a ball in his fist and hurled it away. He stood up, rigid and frenzied, looking around. He wanted to break things, anything. \"So you thought your frenzied period was over, did you!\" he yelled at himself, lurching forward to fling over the bar.\n Then he caught himself and held back. No, no, don\u0027t get started, he begged. Two shaking hands ran through his lank blond hair. His throat moved convulsively and he shuddered with the repressed craving for violence.\n The sound of the whisky gurgling into the glass angered him. He turned the bottle upside down and the whisky spurted out in great gushes, splashing up the sides of the glass and over onto the mahogany top of the bar.\n He swallowed the whole glassful at once, head thrown back, whisky running out the edges of his mouth.\n I\u0027m an animal! he exulted. I\u0027m a dumb, stupid animal and I\u0027m going to drink!\n He emptied the glass, then flung it across the room. It bounced off the bookcase and rolled across the rug. \"Oh, so you won\u0027t break, won\u0027t you!\" he rasped inside his head, leaping across the rug to grind the glass into splinters under his heavy shoes.\n Then he spun and stumbled to the bar again. He filled another glass and poured the contents down his throat. I wish I had a pipe with whisky in it! he thought. I\u0027d connect a goddamn hose to it and flush whisky down me until it came out my ears! Until I floated in it!\n He flung away the glass. Too slow, too slow, damn it! He drank directly from the uptilted bottle, gulping furiously, hating himself, punishing himself with the whisky burning down his rapidly swallowing throat.\n \"I\u0027ll choke myself!\" he stormed. \"I\u0027ll strangle myself, I\u0027ll drown myself in whisky! Like Clarence in his malmsey, I\u0027ll die, die, die!\"\n He hurled the empty bottle across the room and it shattered on the wall mural. Whisky ran down the tree trunks and onto the ground. He lurched across the room and picked up a piece of the broken bottle. He slashed at the mural and the jagged edge sliced through the scene and peeled it away from the wall. There! he thought, his breath like steam escaping. That for you!\n He flung the glass away, then looked down as he felt dull pain in his fingers. He\u0027d sliced open the flesh.\n Good! he exulted viciously, and pressed on each side of the slices until the blood ran out and fell in big drops on the rug. Bleed to death, you stupid, worthless bastard!\n An hour later he was totally drunk, lying flat on the floor with a vacuous smile on his face.\n World\u0027s gone to hell. No germs, no science. World\u0027s fallen to the supernatural, it\u0027s a supernatural world. Harper\u0027s Bizarre and Saturday Evening Ghost and Ghoul Housekeeping. \"Young Dr. Jekyll\" and \"Dracula\u0027s Other Wife\" and \"Death Can Be Beautiful.\" \"Don\u0027t be half-staked\" and Smith Brothers\u0027 Coffin Drops.\n He stayed drunk for two days and planned on staying drunk till the end of time or the world\u0027s whisky supply, whichever came first.\n And he might have done it, too, if it hadn\u0027t been for a miracle.\n It happened on the third morning, when he stumbled out onto the porch to see if the world was still there.\n There was a dog roving about on the lawn.\n The second it heard him open the front door, it stopped snuffling over the grass, its head jerked up in sudden fright, and it bounded off to the side with a twitch of scrawny limbs.\n For a moment Robert Neville was so shocked he couldn\u0027t move. He stood petrified, staring at the dog, which was limping quickly across the street, its ropelike tail pulled between its legs.\n It was alive! In the daytime! He lurched forward with a dull cry and almost pitched on his face on the lawn. His legs pistoned, his arms flailed for balance. Then he caught himself and started running after the dog.\n \"Hey!\" he called, his hoarse voice breaking the silence of Cimarron Street. \"Come back here!\"\n His shoes thudded across the sidewalk and off the curb, every step driving a battering ram into his head. His heart pulsed heavily.\n \"Hey!\" he called again. \"Come `ere, boy.\"\n Across the street, the dog scrambled unsteadily along the sidewalk, its right hind leg curled up, its dark claws clicking on the cement.\n \"Come `ere, boy, I won\u0027t hurt you!\" Robert Neville called out.\n Already he had a stitch in his side and his head throbbed with pain as he ran. The dog stopped a moment and looked back. Then it darted in between two houses, and for a moment Neville saw it from the side. It was brown and white, breedless, its left ear hanging in shreds, its gaunt body wobbling as it ran.\n \"Don\u0027t run away!\"\n He didn\u0027t hear the shrill quiver of hysteria in his voice as he screamed out the words. His throat choked up as the dog disappeared between the houses. With a grunt of fear he hobbled on faster, ignoring the pain of hangover, everything lost in the need to catch that dog.\n But when he got into the back yard the dog was gone.\n He ran to the redwood fence and looked over. Nothing. He twisted back suddenly to see if the dog were going back out the way it had entered.\n There was no dog.\n For an hour he wandered around the neighborhood on trembling legs, searching vainly, calling out every few moments, \"Come `em, boy, come `em.\"\n At last he stumbled home, his face a mask of hopeless dejection. To come across a living being, after all this time to find a companion, and then to lose it. Even if it was only a dog. Only a dog? To Robert Neville that dog was the peak of a planet\u0027s evolution.\n He couldn\u0027t eat or drink anything. He found himself so ill and trembling at the shock and the loss that he had to lie down. But he couldn\u0027t sleep. He lay there shaking feverishly, his head moving from side to side on the flat pillow.\n \"Come `ere, boy,\" he kept muttering without realizing it. \"Come `ere, boy, I won\u0027t hurt you.\"\n In the afternoon he searched again. For two blocks in each direction from his house he searched each yard, each street, each individual house. But he found nothing.\n When he got home, about five, he put Out a bowl of milk and a piece of hamburger. He put a ring of garlic bulbs around it, hoping the vampires wouldn\u0027t touch it.\n But later it came to him that the dog must be afflicted too, and the garlic would keep it away also. He couldn\u0027t understand that. If the dog had the germ, how could it roam outdoors during the daylight hours? Unless it had such a small dosing of bacilli in its veins that it wasn\u0027t really affected yet. But, if that were true, how had it survived the nightly attacks?\n Oh, my God, the thought came then, what if it comes back tonight for the meat and they kill it? What if he went out the next morning and found the dog\u0027s body on the lawn and knew that he was responsible for its death? I couldn\u0027t take that, he thought miserably. I\u0027ll blow out my brains if that happens, I swear I will.\n The thought dredged up again the endless enigma of why he went on. All right, there were a few possibilities for experiment now, but life was still a barren, cheerless trial. Despite everything he had or might have (except, of course, another human being), life gave no promise of improvement or even of change. The way things shaped up, he would live out his life with no more than he already had. And how many years was that? Thirty, maybe forty if he didn\u0027t drink himself to death.\n The thought of forty more years of living as he was made him shudder.\n And yet he hadn\u0027t killed himself. True, he hardly treated his body welfare with reverence. He didn\u0027t eat properly, drink properly, sleep properly, or do anything properly. His health wasn\u0027t going to last indefinitely; he was already cheating the percentages, he suspected.\n But using his body carelessly wasn\u0027t suicide. He\u0027d never even approached suicide. Why?\n There seemed no answer. He wasn\u0027t resigned to anything, he hadn\u0027t accepted or adjusted to the life he\u0027d been forced into. Yet here he was, eight months after the plague\u0027s last victim, nine since he\u0027d spoken to another human being, ten since Virginia had died. Here he was with no future and a virtually hopeless present. Still plodding on.\n Instinct? Or was he just stupid? Too unimaginative to destroy himself? Why hadn\u0027t he done it in the beginning, when he was in the very depths? What had impelled him to enclose the house, install a freezer, a generator, an electric stove, a water tank, build a hothouse, a workbench, burn down the houses on each side of his, collect records and books and mountains of canned supplies, even—it was fantastic when you thought about it—even put a fancy mural on the wall?\n Was the life force something more than words, a tangible, mind-controlling potency? Was nature somehow, in him, maintaining its spark against its own encroachments?\n He closed his eyes. Why think, why reason? There was no answer. His continuance was an accident and an attendant bovinity. He was just too dumb to end it all, and that was about the size of it.\n Later he glued up the sliced mural and put it back into place. The slits didn\u0027t show too badly unless he stood very close to the paper.\n He tried briefly to get back to the problem of the bacilli, but he realized that he couldn\u0027t concentrate on anything except the dog. To his complete astonishment, he later found himself offering up a stumbling prayer that the dog would be protected. It was a moment in whi\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/376/990.html","bookId":308,"book":{"id":308,"title":"我是传奇 I Am Legend","description":"简介： 《我是传奇》（I Am Legend）是一部于2007年上映的末世科幻电影，由法兰西斯罗伦斯（Francis Lawrence）执导，威尔史密斯主演。电影根据李察麦森（Richard Matheson）的同名小说改编，也是该...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110909/1-110Z9151S9421.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/376","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
