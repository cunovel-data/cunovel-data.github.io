{"id":24714,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIII THE WEDDING OF EULOGE SCHNEIDER","content":"Saint-Just looked the man over from head to foot, as if to make sure that he was not dealing with a madman. \"And you come, you say—\" he asked. \"From your colleague Lebas.\" \"To tell me—\" The man lowered his voice again so that Charles could not hear what he said; as for the secretary, he had long since gone out to carry Saint-Just\u0027s decrees to the printer. \"Impossible,\" said the pro-consul, passing from hope to doubt; for the thing appeared incredible to him. \"Nevertheless, it is so,\" replied the messenger. \"But he would never dare!\" said Saint-Just, setting his teeth and allowing a glance of hatred to escape his eyes. \"It is the Hussars of Death themselves who are guarding the gate and who will not allow it to be shut.\" \"The Kehl gate?\" \"The Kehl gate.\" \"The very one that faces the enemy?\" \"Yes, that very one.\" \"In spite of my formal order?\" \"In spite of your formal order.\" \"And what reason have the Hussars of Death given for preventing that gate from being closed at three o\u0027clock, when there is a formal order that all the gates of Strasbourg shall be shut at that hour under pain of death to him who prevents it?\" \"They say that the Commissioner of the Republic is to return to the city by that gate with his betrothed.\" \"Euloge Schneider\u0027s betrothed? The betrothed of the Monk of Cologne?\" [Pg 88] Saint-Just looked around him, evidently seeking Charles in the shadows which were beginning to darken the apartment. \"If you are looking for me, citizen Saint-Just, here I am,\" said the youth, approaching him. \"Yes, come here! Have you heard that your Greek professor is about to be married?\" Mademoiselle de Brumpt\u0027s story recurred at once to the boy\u0027s mind. \"It would take too long to tell you what I think.\" \"No, tell me,\" said Saint-Just, laughing; \"we have plenty of time.\" Charles related the story of the dinner at Euloge Schneider\u0027s, together with the episode of the young girl and that of the executioner. As he listened, Saint-Just\u0027s head remained motionless, but the rest of his body quivered unceasingly. Suddenly a great hubbub was heard in one of the streets leading from the Kehl gate to the town-hall. Doubtless Saint-Just divined the cause of this commotion, for, turning to Charles, he said: \"If you would like to go, my child, you are free to do so; but if you would like to be present at a great act of justice, remain.\" Charles\u0027s curiosity forbade him to go, and he remained. The messenger went to the window and drew aside the curtain. \"There,\" said he, \"there is the proof that I was not mistaken.\" \"Open the window,\" said Saint-Just. The messenger obeyed. The window opened upon a balcony which hung over the street. Saint-Just went out, and, at his invitation, Charles and the messenger followed him. The clock struck. Saint-Just turned around; it was four o\u0027clock. The procession was just entering the square. Four couriers, dressed in the national colors, preceded the carriage, which was drawn by six white horses and uncovered in spite of the threatening weather. Euloge was[Pg 89] seated in it with his betrothed, who was richly dressed and dazzling in her youth and beauty. His customary escort, the black horsemen, the Hussars of Death, caracoled around the carriage with drawn swords, with which they struck those who were curious enough to approach too near. Behind them came a low cart, with large wheels painted red, drawn by two horses decorated with the tri-color ribbons, and loaded with planks, posts, and steps, painted red like the rest. The two sinister-looking men in charge of it, with their black trousers and the fatal \"red bonnet\" with its large cockade, were exchanging rather doleful pleasantries with the Hussars of Death. The rear of the procession was brought up by a small carriage, in which a small, grave, thin man was sitting, at whom the people pointed curiously, designating him simply as \"Master Nicholas.\" The procession was accompanied by a double row of men bearing torches. Schneider was coming to present his betrothed to Saint-Just, who, as we have seen, had gone out upon the balcony to meet them. Saint-Just, calm, stern, and cold as the statue of Justice, was not popular: he was feared and respected. So that when he appeared on the balcony dressed as a representative of the people, with his plumed hat, the tri-color sash round his waist, and the sword at his side which he knew how to use with such good effect upon occasion, there were neither cries nor cheers, but a cold whispering and a backward movement, which left a great lighted circle in the midst of the crowd, into which the carriage of the betrothed couple drove slowly, followed by the cart bearing the guillotine and the cab with the executioner. Saint-Just made a sign with his hand for the procession to stop, and the crowd, as we have said, not only stopped, but drew back. Every one thought that Saint-Just was about to speak first; and in fact, after the imperative gesture which he made with supreme dignity, he had intended to speak, when, to[Pg 90] the astonishment of all, the young girl opened the door of the carriage with a rapid movement, sprang to the ground, closed the door, and, falling on her knees on the pavement, cried suddenly in the midst of the solemn silence: \"Justice, citizen! I appeal to Saint-Just and to the Convention for justice!\" \"Against whom?\" asked Saint-Just, in his quivering, incisive voice. \"Against this man, against Euloge Schneider, against the special commissioner of the Republic!\" \"Speak; what has he done?\" replied Saint-Just; \"Justice listens to you.\" Then, in a voice full-of emotion, but strong, indignant, and menacing, the young girl related all the hideous drama—the death of her mother, her father\u0027s arrest, the scaffold reared before her house, the alternative which had been offered her; and at each terrible climax, to which Saint-Just listened without seeming able to credit them, she turned to the executioner, the assistants, the Hussars of Death, for confirmation; even to Schneider himself. And each one to whom she appealed replied: \"Yes, it is true!\" Except Schneider, who, crushed and crouching like a jaguar ready to spring, assented only by his silence. Saint-Just, gnawing at his finger-tips, let her finish, and then, when she had ended, he said: \"You ask justice, citizeness Brumpt, and you shall have it. But what would you have done if I had not been willing to grant it?\" She drew a dagger from her breast. \"To-night, in bed,\" she said, \"I would have stabbed him. Charlotte Corday has taught us how to treat a Marat! But now,\" she added, \"now that I am free to weep for my mother and to console my father, I ask mercy for that man.\" At the word \"mercy,\" Saint-Just started as if he had been bitten by a serpent. \"Mercy for him!\" he cried, striking the railing of the balcony with his fist. \"Mercy for this execrable man! mercy for the Monk of Cologne! You are jesting, young woman.[Pg 91] If I should do that, Justice would spread her wings and fly away never to return. Mercy for him!\" Then, in a terrible voice which was heard for a great distance around, he cried: \"To the guillotine!\" The pale, thin, serious man got down from his cab, approached the balcony, and, taking off his hat with a bow, said: \"Shall I behead him, citizen Saint-Just?\" \"Unfortunately I have no right to order that; if I had, Humanity would be avenged within a quarter of an hour. No, as special commissioner he must appear before the revolutionary tribunal, and not before me. No, apply to him the torture he himself has invented; tie him to the guillotine. Shame here and death yonder!\" And with a gesture of supreme power he stretched out his arm toward Paris. Then, as if he had finished his part in the drama, he pushed the messenger, who had informed him of the violation of his orders, and little Charles, whom by another act of justice he had just set free, into the room before him, and closed the window. Laying his hand on the boy\u0027s shoulder, he said: \"Never forget what you have seen; and if any one ever says in your presence that Saint-Just is not a lover of the Revolution, of liberty, and of justice, say aloud that that is not true. And now go where you like; you are free.\" Charles, in a transport of youthful admiration, tried to kiss Saint-Just\u0027s hand; but the latter drew it back hastily, and, leaning over Charles, kissed him on the forehead. Forty years later, Charles, now a man, said to me, while relating the scene and urging me to make a book of it, that he could still in memory feel the impression that kiss had made upon him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90771.html","bookId":398,"book":{"id":398,"title":"The Whites and the Blues","description":"简介： In the preface of The Companions of Jehu I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness.
