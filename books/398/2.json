{"id":24701,"no":2,"title":"INTRODUCTION","content":"In the preface of \"The Companions of Jehu\" I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness. In short, I borrowed my dénouement from him. Now \"The Whites and the Blues,\" being a continuation of \"The Companions of Jehu,\" my readers will not be astonished if I again borrow from Nodier for the beginning of my story. During his long illness, which was simply a gradual decay of physical and vital strength, I was one of his most constant visitors; and as, on account of his incessant labors, he had not had the time to read my books relating to the epoch with which he was so familiar, he sent for the seven or eight hundred volumes while he was ill and confined to his bed, and read them eagerly. In proportion as he became better acquainted with my methods, his literary confidence in me increased, until, when I spoke to him of his own work, he would reply: \"Oh! I have never had time to do more than outline rough drafts of events which, if you had possessed the facts, would have furnished you with material for ten volumes, instead of the two hundred lines that I have made of them.\" And thus it was that he came to relate the four pages which served me as the foundation for the three volumes of \"The Companions of Jehu,\" and the anecdote of Euloge Schneider, from which he declared that I would have made at least ten. \"But,\" he continued, \"some day, my friend, you will[Pg 6] write them, and if it is true that any part of us survives, I shall rejoice yonder over your success and shall feel that I have had some share in it.\" Well, I have written \"The Companions of Jehu,\" and since the great success which it achieved I have been tormented with a desire to write a great romance, entitled \"The Whites and the Blues,\" from what he told me, taking my point of departure for this new book from Nodier\u0027s \"Episodes de la Révolution,\" as I did the motive for a former one from his \"Réaction Thermidorienne.\" But, as I was about to begin, I was seized by a scruple. This time I wished not only to borrow a few pages from him, but to make him assume a r?le in the action of the drama. Then I wrote to my dear sister, Marie Mennessier, to request her permission to do what I had already done once without her permission; namely, take a graft from the paternal tree to improve my own stock. This is what she replied: Anything and everything that you wish, dear brother Alexandre. I deliver my father to you with as much confidence as if he were your own. His memory is in good hands. Marie Mennessier-Nodier. From that moment there was nothing more to stop me; and as I had already outlined my plot, I set to work at once. I therefore offer this publication to-day; but in giving it to the public, I desire to acquit myself of the following duty: This book is dedicated to my illustrious friend and collaborator, Charles Nodier. I have used the word \"collaborator,\" because the trouble I should take in seeking for a better would be thrown away. Alex. Dumas. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90758.html","bookId":398,"book":{"id":398,"title":"The Whites and the Blues","description":"简介： In the preface of The Companions of Jehu I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness.
