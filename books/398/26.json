{"id":24725,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV CITIZEN FENOUILLOT, COMMERCIAL TRAVELLER FOR CHAMPAGNE","content":"Pichegru\u0027s valet de chambre, who had the good sense not to change his title for that of an official, and his name of Leblanc for that of Lerouge, had, in the meantime, set the table for breakfast, and covered it with the provisions which he had brought with him—a necessary precaution when, as now, they passed from the battlefield to the breakfast table. [Pg 156] Our young men, wearied, hungry, some of them even wounded, were not insensible to the prospect of breakfast, of which they felt the greatest need. But the cheers of satisfaction redoubled when they saw among a number of bottles, whose simplicity denoted their democratic origin, six others with silver collars, showing that they belonged to the best houses of Champagne. Pichegru himself noticed it, and, turning to his valet, said with military freedom: \"Ah, Leblanc, is it my birthday or yours? Or is it simply to celebrate our victory of to-day that we find such wine upon my table? Do you know that I should get my throat cut for this if it were reported to the Committee of Public Safety?\" \"Citizen general,\" replied the valet, \"those are not the reasons, although, for that matter, your victory deserves to be celebrated; and on a day when you have taken seven hundred and fifty thousand francs you may well drink twenty francs\u0027 worth of champagne without wronging the government. No, general, do not let your conscience trouble you; the champagne which you will drink to-day will cost neither you nor the government a penny.\" \"I hope, rascal,\" said Pichegru, laughing, \"that it has not been stolen from some wine merchant, or pillaged from some cellar?\" \"No, general, it was a patriotic gift.\" \"A patriotic gift?\" \"Yes, from citizen Fenouillot.\" \"Who is citizen Fenouillot? Is that the lawyer at Besan?on; for there is such a lawyer at Besan?on, is there not, Charles?\" \"Yes,\" replied the boy, \"he is one of my father\u0027s best friends.\" \"He has nothing to do with lawyers, or with Besan?on either for that matter,\" said Leblanc, who was permitted to speak freely with the general; \"he is citizen Fenouillot, commercial traveller for the house of Fraissinet of Chalons, who, in gratitude for the service you have done him in de[Pg 157]livering him out of the hands of the enemy, has sent you these six bottles of wine, so that you may drink them to your own health and to that of the Republic.\" \"Then your citizen Fenouillot was here with the enemy?\" \"Certainly, since he was a prisoner, he and his samples.\" \"Do you hear, general?\" asked Abatucci. \"Perhaps he might be able to give us some useful information,\" suggested Doumerc. \"Where does your citizen live?\" asked Pichegru. \"Here, in the hotel to the left of the town-hall.\" \"Put on an extra plate—there, just opposite mine—and then go tell citizen Fenouillot that I request the pleasure of his company at breakfast with us. Gentlemen, take your customary places while we are waiting.\" The officers seated themselves as usual, and Pichegru put Charles at his left. Leblanc put on the extra plate and then went out. Five minutes later he returned. He had found citizen Fenouillot just about to sit down to breakfast, but he had eagerly accepted the general\u0027s invitation. Consequently, he was following the messenger who had been sent for him; and, in fact, a moment after Leblanc had returned, some one knocked at the door, giving the Masonic raps. Leblanc hastened to open it. A man about thirty-five years of age stood upon the threshold, attired in the civilian\u0027s dress of that period—a pointed, broad-brimmed hat, a loose cravat, and a waistcoat with large lapels. He had on a brown coat with long skirts, tight, light-colored trousers and top boots; his complexion was fair and his hair curled naturally; he had brown eyebrows and whiskers, the latter half-hidden in his cravat. His eyes were bold, his nose was large and his lips were thin. As he entered the dining-room, Fenouillot hesitated slightly. \"Come in, citizen Fenouillot,\" said Pichegru, who had seen the hesitation, slight as it was. \"Upon my word,\" said the latter easily, \"the thing was[Pg 158] of so little consequence that I hesitated to believe that your kind invitation was intended for me.\" \"What of little consequence? Do you know that, with my allowance of five hundred francs a day, I should have to go three days without eating in order to afford fare like this? So sit down opposite me, citizen. Take your place!\" The two officers who were appointed to sit beside him moved their chairs and pointed to his. Citizen Fenouillot sat down, and the general cast a rapid glance at his snow-white linen and his carefully kept hands. \"And you were a prisoner when we entered Dawendorff?\" \"About that, general. I did not know the road to Haguenau was invested until I was stopped by some Prussians, who were preparing to drink my samples when, happily, an officer arrived who took me to the commander-in-chief. I thought I had nothing more to fear than the loss of my samples, and was already consoling myself with that notion when the word \u0027spy\u0027 fell upon my ears. At that, as you can readily understand, I began to think, and then I asked to be taken to the commander of the royalists.\" \"The Prince de Condé?\" \"I would have asked for the devil himself, as you can well imagine! They took me to the Prince, who examined my papers, and as I answered all his questions frankly, and he saw, after tasting my wine, that it was not of a kind that a dishonest man would carry, he told his allies, the Prussians, that I was a Frenchman, and that he would detain me as his prisoner.\" \"And was your detention hard?\" asked Abatucci, while Pichegru regarded his guest with a scrutiny that showed he was rather inclined to share the Prussian general\u0027s opinion. \"Not at all,\" replied citizen Fenouillot; \"the Prince and his son liked my wine, and they treated me with a consideration almost equal to that which you have shown me, although I must confess that when the news of the capitulation of Toulon arrived, yesterday, and I, as a good French[Pg 159]man, could not conceal my delight, the Prince, with whom I was talking at the time, dismissed me in a very bad humor.\" \"Ah, ha!\" exclaimed Pichegru; \"then Toulon has really been recaptured from the English?\" \"Yes, general.\" \"What day was Toulon taken?\" \"The 19th.\" \"And to-day is the 21st. Impossible! The devil! the Prince de Condé has not the telegraph at his disposal.\" \"No,\" replied the other; \"but he has the pigeon-post, and carrier-pigeons travel forty-eight miles an hour. In short, the news came to Strasbourg, where pigeons abound, and I myself saw the little note in the Prince\u0027s hands. The note was small, having been fastened under the bird\u0027s wing, but the writing was fine, and therefore it contained several details.\" \"And do you know what they were?\" \"The city capitulated on the 19th. That same day part of the besieging army entered, and, in the evening, by order of the commissioner of the Convention, two hundred and thirteen persons were shot.\" \"Is that all? Did it not mention a certain Buonaparte?\" \"Yes, indeed; it said that the capture of the city was due to him.\" \"He is certainly my cousin,\" said Abatucci, laughing. \"And my pupil,\" added Pichegru. \"Faith, so much the better! The Republic needs men of genius to offset such wretches as Fouché.\" \"Fouché?\" \"Was it not Fouché who followed the French army to Lyons, and on the first day he was in power ordered two hundred and thirteen men shot?\" \"Ah, yes; but that was at Lyons. At Toulon it is citizen Barras.\" \"And who is citizen Barras?\" \"Only a deputy from the Var, who has served in India,[Pg 160] and learned there to imitate the habits of the Nabobs. At the Convention he sits with the Mountain. At all events; it looks as if they were going to shoot all the population, and raze the town.\" \"Let them destroy and shoot! The sooner they do it, the quicker they will get through,\" said Pichegru. \"Faith! I prefer our former good God to the modern Supreme Being who permits such horrors.\" \"And what do they say of my cousin Buonaparte?\" \"They say that he is a young artillery officer,\" continued citizen Fenouillot, \"and a friend of young Robespierre.\" \"Come, general,\" said Abatucci, \"if he is on such good terms with the Jacobins as that, he will make his way and protect us in the bargain.\" \"Speaking of protection,\" said citizen Fenouillot, \"is what the Duc de Bourbon told me when he was eulogizing you true?\" \"Very kind of the Duc de Bourbon,\" said Pichegru, laughing. \"What did he tell you?\" \"That it was his father, the Prince de Condé, to whom you owed your first promotion.\" \"Yes,\" replied Pichegru. \"How was that?\" asked three or four voices. \"I was serving as a common soldier in the royal artillery, when one day the Prince de Condé, who was present at the battery exercises at Besan?on, came over to the gun which he considered the best managed; but while the gunner was sponging the piece it went off and shot away his arm. The prince attributed this accident to me, accusing me of not having properly closed the orifice with my thumb. I let him talk, and my only reply was to show him my bleeding hand. My thumb was turned back, and almost torn from the hand. Here,\" he continued, holding out his hand; \"here is the scar. The prince forthwith promoted me to the rank of sergeant.\" Little Charles, who was near the general, took his hand[Pg 161] as if he wanted to examine it, and with a sudden movement stooped and kissed it. \"Why, what are you doing?\" asked Pichegru, pulling his hand away quickly. \"I? Nothing,\" said Charles. \"I admire you.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90782.html","bookId":398,"book":{"id":398,"title":"The Whites and the Blues","description":"简介： In the preface of The Companions of Jehu I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness.
