{"id":24718,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVII PICHEGRU","content":"Pichegru is destined to play so important a part in this story that we must fix the eyes of the reader upon him with more attention than we have done with the secondary characters that we have hitherto put upon the scene. Charles Pichegru was born on the 16th of February, 1761, in the village of Planches, near Arbois. His family were poor and rustic; his forefathers had been known for three or four hundred years as honest day-laborers, and they had derived their name from the character of their work. They reaped their gru or grain, with the pic or mattock; from these two words, pic and gru, the name of Pichegru had been derived. Pichegru, who early showed traces of that precocious disposition which marks the distinguished man, began his education at the school of the Paulist Fathers at Arbois; they, seeing his rapid progress, particularly in mathematics, sent him, with Father Patrault, one of their professors, to the College of Brienne. There he made such progress that at the end of two years he was appointed assistant professor. At this period his whole ambition was to be a monk; but Father Patrault, who divined Napoleon\u0027s genius, saw,[Pg 114] with equal clearness, Pichegru\u0027s possibilities, and induced him to turn his attention to military life. Yielding to his advice, Pichegru, in 1783, entered the first foot artillery, where, thanks to his incontestable merit, he promptly rose to the rank of adjutant, in which grade he made his first campaign in America. Upon his return to France he ardently embraced the principles of 1789, and was a leader in a popular society in Besan?on, when a regiment of the Volunteer Guards, passing through the city, chose him for their commander. Two months later Pichegru was commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine. M. de Narbonne, Minister of War, having missed him, asked one day in speaking of him: \"What became of that young officer to whom all the colonels were tempted to take off their hats when they spoke to him?\" This young officer had become commander-in-chief of the Army of the Rhine, a promotion that had not tended to make him any prouder than he had been before. And, indeed, Pichegru\u0027s rapid advancement, his fine education, and the exalted position he held in the army had not changed in the least the simplicity of his heart. As a sub-officer, he had had a mistress, and had always provided for her; her name was Rose, she was thirty years old, a dressmaker, lame, and not at all pretty. She lived at Besan?on. Once a week she wrote to the general, always in the most respectful manner. These letters were always full of good counsel and tender advice; she admonished the general not to be dazzled by his good fortune, and to remain the same Charlot that he had always been at home; she urged him to economy, not for her sake, but for that of his parents. She, God be thanked, could take care of herself; she had made six dresses for the wife of a representative, and was to make six more for the wife of a general. She had in addition three pieces of gold, which represented fifteen or sixteen hundred francs in paper money. Pichegru, whatever his occupation, always read these[Pg 115] letters as soon as he received them, and put them away in his portfolio carefully, saying: \"Poor dear girl, I myself taught her how to spell.\" We crave permission to enlarge upon these details. We are about to bring actively upon the stage men who, for a long time, have been more or less prominently before the eyes of Europe, who have been praised or blamed as the different parties wished to elevate or abase them. Historians themselves have judged these men more or less superficially, thanks to their habit of accepting ready-made opinions; but it is different with the novelist, constrained as he is to descend to the veriest details, since in the most insignificant he may sometimes find the thread that will guide him through the most inextricable labyrinth—that of the human heart. We therefore dare to affirm that in showing them in their private life, which historians altogether neglect to do, as well as in their public life, to which too much attention is often paid, although it is sometimes but the mask of the other, we shall bring these illustrious dead before the reader\u0027s eyes, for the first time as they really were—these dead whom political passions have cast into the hands of calumny to be buried and forgotten. Thus history tells us that Pichegru betrayed France, for the sake of the government of Alsace, the red ribbon, the Chateau of Chambord, its park, and its dependencies, together with twelve pieces of cannon, a million, in ready money, two thousand francs of income, half of which was revertible at his death to his wife, and five thousand to each of his children; and finally the territory of Arbois, which was to bear the title of Pichegru, and was to be exempt from taxes for ten years. The material reply to this accusation is that, as Pichegru was never married, he had neither wife nor children to provide for; the moral reply is, to show him in his private life that we may know what his needs and ambitions really were. Rose, as we have seen, gave two pieces of advice to her lover: One was to practice economy for his parents\u0027 sake,[Pg 116] and the other was to remain the same good and simple Charlot that he had always been. Pichegru received during the campaign a daily sum of one hundred and fifty thousand francs in paper money. The sum for the whole month arrived on the 1st in great sheets divided off. Every morning enough was cut off for the needs of the day, and the sheet was laid upon a table with a pair of scissors upon it. Any one who wished had access to it, and the result was that the sheet rarely lasted the whole month. When it was gone, on the 24th or 25th, as frequently happened, every one had to get along as best he could for the remainder of the time. One of his secretaries wrote of him: \"The great mathematician of Brienne was incapable of calculating in ready money the account of his washerwoman.\" And he added: \"An empire would have been too small for his genius; a farm was too great for his indolence.\" As for Rose\u0027s advice to remain \"the same good Charlot,\" we shall see whether he needed the advice. Two or three years after the time of which we are writing, Pichegru, then at the height of his popularity, on his return to his beloved Franche-Comté, to revisit his natal town of Planche, was stopped at the entrance of Arbois, beneath a triumphal arch, by a deputation which came to compliment him and to invite him to a state dinner and a grand ball. Pichegru listened smilingly to the orator, and when he had finished, said: \"My dear compatriot, I have only a few hours to pass in the place where I was born, and I must devote most of them to my relatives in the neighboring villages; if the friendship which exists between us should lead me to neglect them, you would be the first to blame me, and you would be right. You have come to invite me to a dinner and a ball, and, although I have not been in the habit of indulging in those pleasures lately, I should be delighted to participate in them. I should be pleased to drink a few glasses of our excellent new wine in such good company, and to watch the young[Pg 117] girls of Arbois dancing; they must be very pretty, if they resemble their mothers. But a soldier has only his word, and I swear to you, on my honor, that I am engaged. Long ago I promised Barbier, the vine-dresser, to take my first meal with him when next I should come here, and I cannot in conscience eat two dinners between now and sunset.\" \"But,\" said the president, \"it seems to me that there is a way of compromising the difficulty.\" \"What is it?\" \"To invite Barbier to dine with us.\" \"If you do that, and he accepts, I shall ask nothing better,\" said Pichegru. \"But I doubt if he will. Does he still have that same fierce and melancholy air which won him the name of Barbier the Desperate?\" \"More than ever, general.\" \"Well, I will go and find him myself,\" said Pichegru, \"for I think nothing short of my influence will induce him to dine with us.\" \"Very well, general, we will accompany you,\" said the deputies. \"Come along,\" said Pichegru. And they went in search of Barbier the Desperate, a poor vine-dresser, who owned only a hundred vines, and who watered with their produce his poor crust of black bread. They walked through the town. At the other end the general stopped before an old linden tree. \"Citizens,\" he said, \"preserve this tree and never allow any one to cut it down. It was here that a hero, who had defended your town with five hundred men against the whole royal army commanded by Biron, suffered martyrdom. The hero\u0027s name was Claude Morel. That brute of a beast, named Biron, who ended by biting the hand that fed him, had Morel hanged to that tree. A few years later, it was Biron himself, who, having betrayed France, fought for his life with the executioner, until the man was forced to cut off his head by a miracle of strength and skill, tak[Pg 118]ing his sword from the attendant\u0027s hand when the prisoner was not looking.\" And saluting the glorious tree, Pichegru continued on his way amid the plaudits of the people who accompanied him. Some one who knew where Barbier\u0027s vineyard was, discovered him in the midst of the poles and called him. Barbier lifted his head, covered with the traditional red cap, and asked: \"Who wants me?\" \"Charlot,\" replied the other. \"What Charlot?\" \"Charlot Pichegru.\" \"You are making fun of me,\" said the vine-dresser, and he returned to his work. \"Indeed, I am not, for here he is himself.\" \"Hey! Barbier,\" cried Pichegru. At the well-known voice, Barbier the Desperate stood up, and seeing the general\u0027s uniform in the midst of the group, he exclaimed: \"Hallo! is it really he?\" Running through the poles, he stopped at the edge of the vineyard to assure himself that he was not the victim of a hallucination. Having satisfied himself that it really was the general, he ran to him, and, throwing himself into his arms, cried: \"Is it indeed you, my dear Charlot, my Charlot?\" \"And is it you, my dear friend?\" replied Pichegru, pressing him to his heart. And the peasant and his friend wept together, while every one drew aside that their meeting might be uninterrupted. After the first greetings had been exchanged, the president approached them, and explained to Barbier the Desperate the object of this ceremonious visit in the midst of the fields. Barbier looked at Pichegru to know whether he should accept or not. The latter nodded affirmatively. Barbier wished at least to go home and put on his Sunday clothes, but the president, who had read in Berchou\u0027s poems what that famous lover of good cheer has to say[Pg 119] about warmed-up dinners, would not allow him to take the time, and they escorted Pichegru and Barbier the Desperate to the mayor\u0027s house, where dinner was awaiting them. Pichegru placed the president at his right, but Barbier the Desperate sat at his left, and Pichegru talked to him constantly, never leaving him until he took his departure. We crave pardon for this long digression which gives a glimpse of one of the most remarkable men of the Revolution. This glance, thrown upon his private life, will aid us to judge and understand, perhaps more impartially than has been done in the past, the man who is to be one of the most important characters in this story. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90775.html","bookId":398,"book":{"id":398,"title":"The Whites and the Blues","description":"简介： In the preface of The Companions of Jehu I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness.
