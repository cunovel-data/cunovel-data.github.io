{"id":24734,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII THE ORDER OF THE DAY","content":"However much we may desire not to lose ourselves in accounts of sieges and battles, we must now follow Hoche and Pichegru in their triumphal course. A chapter or two, however, will suffice to bring us to the time when the enemy was driven beyond the frontiers of France—at least, as far as Alsace and Lorraine are concerned. Moreover, as will be seen, after the three battles of Dawendorff, Froeschwiller, and Woerth, the enemy withdrew from France. At four o\u0027clock in the morning Stephan came to tell Pichegru that the Prussians, amazed at the way they had been driven from Woerth, were retreating across the Vosges in two columns, one going toward Drakenbroenn, and the other toward Lembach. Pichegru at once sent an aide-de-camp to inform Hoche that the town was in his hands and that they would attack on the next day, or rather on that very day at five in the morning. He intended to form his army into three columns to attack in the front, and he directed Hoche to leave the intrenchments, and, marching upon Groersdorff, to attack them on the rear. The retreat of the Prussians rendered this man?uvre unnecessary. Doumerc was awakened, and, springing upon his horse, he hastened to tell Hoche to pursue the enemy, while Pichegru fell back upon Haguenau and occupied the town. [Pg 213] But when Pichegru, at the head of his column, reached the heights of Spachbach, he met a messenger whom the mayor of Haguenau had despatched, who informed him that on learning of the triple victory he had just won, and which completely shut off the town from any communication with the armies of Hodge and Wurmser, the garrison of Haguenau had evacuated the place during the night, had marched through the woods to Souffelnheim, and had crossed the Rhine as far up as Fort Vauban. Pichegru detached a thousand men under command of Liebler, and sent them to occupy Haguenau; then, retracing his steps, he took the road through Woerth, passed on to Pruschdorff, and slept that same night at Lobsam. Stephan was directed to inform Hoche of this unexpected return, and to ask him to join with Pichegru in making still greater efforts to recapture the lines of Weissembourg. The road reminded one of the invasions of the Huns, Vandals and Burgundians, when huge concourses of men swept from land to land. The Austrians, obliged to abandon the line of the Moder, fell back upon the lines of Weissembourg, before the Lauter, where they intended to give battle. They were under General Wurmser\u0027s command. The Prussians, under command of Hodge, fell back upon Sauerbach. They crossed the river at Lembach, and effected a junction with the Austrians at Weissembourg. But what seemed so strange in this retreat was that the army was followed by a swarm of royalists, consisting of Alsatian nobles, who, together with their families, accompanied the troops and shared their flight. The roads were filled with carriages, horses and wagons, all in confusion, through the midst of which the Republicans forced a passage, seemingly unconscious that they were mingling with a hostile population, which, when left behind, seemed to be following the very army from which it was in reality fleeing. The two French generals effected a junction at Roth, and as they met, the soldiers shouted: \"Long live the Republic!\" The ranks opened, and the two representatives,[Pg 214] Saint-Just and Lebas, appeared. It had occurred to them that, as the enemy might be in greater force at Weissembourg, their presence would be encouraging to the soldiers. Charles was the first to recognize the deputy from the Aisne, and cried: \"Ah! there is citizen Saint-Just!\" Pichegru leaned toward him and said laughingly, \"Do not tell him about the foraging-cap.\" \"Oh! indeed, no!\" replied Charles, \"ever since he told me that he had had his best friend shot I have distrusted him.\" \"You are right to do so.\" Saint-Just came up to Pichegru and congratulated him in a few brief and trenchant words. Then, recognizing Charles, he said: \"Ah! it seems that between the toga and arms you have chosen arms. Don\u0027t let him get killed, citizen Pichegru; he is a good boy, and bids fair to become a good man, a rare thing in these days.\" Then taking Pichegru aside, he said: \"My police tell me—though I would not believe them—that you had an interview with an emissary from the Prince de Condé. I don\u0027t believe a word of it.\" \"It is true, nevertheless, citizen Saint-Just.\" \"What did he have to say?\" \"He came to make me some treasonable propositions.\" \"What were they?\" \"I do not know; my pipe had just gone out, so I lighted it again with the Prince de Condé\u0027s letter without taking the trouble to read it.\" \"And you had the messenger shot?\" \"Indeed I did not.\" \"Why not?\" \"If he had been dead, how could he tell his prince what I had done with his propositions?\" \"Pichegru, you did not conceal some other motive beneath this clemency?\" \"Yes, that of beating the enemy the next day at Froeschwiller; of taking Woerth the day following, and of forcing the lines to-day.\" [Pg 215] \"Then you and Hoche are ready to march upon the enemy?\" \"We are always ready, citizen representative, particularly when we are honored with your company.\" \"Then forward!\" said Saint-Just; and he sent Lebas to direct Hoche to attack on his side. The drums and trumpets, sounded all along the line, and the army moved forward. As chance would have it, that same day, the 22d of December, the Prussians and the Austrians had resolved to resume the offensive, and when the French army reached the top of a small eminence they found the enemy drawn up in line of battle from Weissembourg to the Rhine. The position was a good one for offence but not for defence, for in the latter case the Lauter formed an abyss, and there was much danger of their being driven into it. When Pichegru and Hoche marched against them they found that the enemy was also on the march. Supposing that the fiercest struggle would be in the centre, the generals massed thirty-five thousand men there, while three divisions of the Army of the Moselle threatened the right wing of the allies by the passes of the Vosges, and two divisions, commanded by one of General Broglie\u0027s aides-de-camp, advanced to the attack by way of Lauterbourg. The young aide-de-camp, whose name was Antoine Desaix, was scarcely twenty-seven years old. Suddenly Saint-Just and Lebas, who were marching respectively in front of the columns of Pichegru and Hoche, called out: \"Halt!\" They were not more than a cannon-shot from the enemy, and it was evident that the two armies would meet before another half hour. \"Citizen Pichegru,\" said Saint-Just, while Lebas said the same to Hoche, \"call all your officers to the front; I have a communication to make to them before the battle begins.\" Pichegru gave the necessary orders, which were repeated[Pg 216] all along the line by brigadier-generals, colonels, aides-de-camp, and captains. The officers of every rank, even to the sub-lieutenants, gathered around Saint-Just and Pichegru on the right, and Hoche and Lebas on the left. This took up about ten minutes, during which the officers alone moved while the soldiers stood quietly waiting. The Prussians and Austrians advanced nearer, and the Republicans began to hear their trumpets and drums beating and sounding the charge. Saint-Just drew a printed sheet from his pocket; it was the \"Moniteur.\" \"Citizens,\" he said in his harsh voice, which was so powerful that it could be heard five hundred feet away, \"before you attack I should like to tell you a piece of good news.\" \"What is it? What is it?\" cried all the officers together. Just then one of the enemy\u0027s batteries opened fire, and its projectiles found their victims in the French ranks. One of the officers had his head carried off by a ball, and fell at Saint-Just\u0027s feet, who, apparently oblivious of the fact, continued in the same tone: \"The English are driven from Toulon, the infamous city. The tri-color flag floats over the ramparts. Here is the \u0027Moniteur,\u0027 which contains not only the official announcement, but also the details which I would read you if we were not under fire.\" \"Read them,\" said Pichegru. \"Read them, citizen representative of the people; read them!\" cried all the officers. The soldiers, in whose ranks the volley had plowed several furrows, looked impatiently at the group of officers. A second discharge was heard, and a second hurricane of fire whistled past. Other furrows were opened. \"Close the ranks,\" Pichegru cried to the soldiers. \"Close the ranks!\" repeated the officers. And the empty spaces disappeared. In the middle of the circle a horse was lying dead beneath his rider. The officer disengaged his feet from the[Pg 217] stirrups and drew nearer to Saint-Just in order to hear better. Saint-Just read: 28th Frimaire of the Year II. of the Republic, one and indivisible; eleven of the evening. Citizen Dugommier to the National Convention: Citizen Representatives—Toulon is ours: Yesterday we took Fort Mulgrave and the Little Gibraltar. This morning the English evacuated the forts and burned the French fleet and the arsenal. The building where the masts were stored is on fire; twenty-six warships are burned, eleven of which are ships of the line, and six are frigates; fifteen are captured, and thirty-eight saved. At ten o\u0027clock this evening Colonel Cervoni entered the town. To-morrow I will write more fully. Long live the Republic! \"Long live the Republic!\" cried the officers in turn. \"Long live the Republic!\" repeated the centre and the right wing. A third cannonade was heard and more than one shout of \"Long live the Republic!\" was begun and never finished. \"Now,\" continued Saint-Just, \"here is a letter from our colleague Barras, who is charged with the punishment of Toulon; it is addressed to the National Convention: Citizen Representatives—The greater part of the infamous inhabitants of Toulon have embarked on the ships of Hood and Sidney Smith, and consequently national justice cannot be administered as it ought to be. Fortunately they were unable to take their houses with them; the city remains to disappear beneath the vengeance of the Republic, like those accursed cities of antiquity, for which the eye searches in vain. At first it was thought best to destroy the city by blowing it up, but it would not do to risk firing the powder-magazines and the arsenal. It has therefore been decided that all the masons from the six neighboring departments shall be summoned hither with their tools, for a general and prompt demolition. With an army of twelve thousand masons the work will be accomplished speedily, and Toulon should be levelled to the ground within a fortnight. [Pg 218]To-morrow the shooting of the traitors will begin, and will be continued until no more traitors remain to be shot. We salute you fraternally. Long live the Republic. The enemy still continued to advance; the rolling of drums, the blare of the trumpets, and from time to time, when the wind was favorable, the harmonious tones of music could be heard in the distance. But every sound was soon lost in the roar of the cannon; a storm of shot, thick as hail, fell upon the French ranks, the body of officers being especially singled out. Pichegru rose in his stirrups, and noticing a slight movement among the soldiers, shouted: \"To your ranks!\" \"To your ranks!\" repeated the officers. The lines reformed. \"Ground arms!\" cried Pichegru. Ten thousand muskets touched the earth at the same moment with admirable precision. \"Now,\" continued Saint-Just, \"here is a communication from the Minister of War; it is addressed to me to be transmitted to Generals Pichegru and Hoche: Citizen Representatives—I have received this letter from citizen Dutheuil, junior. \"Toulon is in the hands of the Republic; the cowardice and perfidy of its enemies is complete. The artillery has served splendidly; we owe the victory to it alone. There is not a soldier who has not been a hero; the officers set the men the example. I cannot find words to praise Colonel Bonaparte sufficiently. Great knowledge of military science, keen intelligence, too great a tendency to expose himself—these form a feeble summary of the rare virtues of this rare officer. It is for you, minister, to retain him for the glory of the Republic.\" I have appointed Colonel Bonaparte a brigadier-general, and beg you to direct Generals Hoche and Pichegru to place his name upon the order of the day of the Army of the Rhine. I will show the like honor to the brave man whose name they send me, who shall have been the first to cross the lines at Weissembourg. \"You hear, citizens,\" said Pichegru, \"Colonel Bonaparte\u0027s name is on the order of the day. Let each one re[Pg 219]turn to his post and repeat this name to the soldiers. Now that the English are beaten, down with the Prussians and the Austrians! Forward! Long live the Republic!\" The name of Bonaparte, which had sprung so gloriously into prominence, ran from rank to rank; an immense shout of \"Long live the Republic!\" burst from forty thousand throats; the drums beat the charge, the trumpets sounded, the bands played the \"Marseillaise,\" and the whole army, so long restrained, dashed upon the enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3318/90791.html","bookId":398,"book":{"id":398,"title":"The Whites and the Blues","description":"简介： In the preface of The Companions of Jehu I told why that romance had been written; and those who have read it cannot fail to have seen where I borrowed from Nodier in the description of the execution, of which he was an ocular witness.
