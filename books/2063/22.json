{"id":110822,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Dimitri didn\u0027t elaborate. I was too startled by his words and the rest of the night\u0027s events to even know how to begin to address them. He took me back inside, past the Strigoi on guard duty, and upstairs to my suite. Nathan was no longer outside.\n For a few brief moments, that nagging voice in my head spoke loudly enough to break through my addled thoughts. If I had no guard in the hall and Inna returned soon, I had a very good chance of threatening her enough to get out of here. Admittedly, that would mean I\u0027d have to deal with a house of God only knew how many Strigoi, but my escape odds were better in the house than in this room.\n Then, almost as soon as those thoughts appeared, they vanished. Dimitri snaked his arm around me and pulled me to him. It had been chilly outside, and even if his body was cold, his clothes and jacket provided some warmth. I snuggled closer to him as his hands ran all over me. I thought he was going to bite me, but it was our mouths that met, hard and furious. I wrapped my fingers in his hair, trying to pull him closer to me. Meanwhile, his fingers were running against my bare leg, pushing my skirt up almost to my hip. Anticipation and eagerness lit every part of my body. I had dreamed about the cabin for so long, remembering it with so much longing. I\u0027d never expected anything like that to happen again, but now it could, and I was astonished at how badly I wanted it.\n My hands moved down to his shirt, undoing all the buttons so that I could touch his chest. His skin still felt like ice, a startling contrast to the burning within me. He moved his lips from mine, down to my neck and shoulder, pushing down the dress\u0027s strap as he covered my flesh with hungry kisses. His hand was still on the side of my bare hip, and I frantically tried to pull his shirt off altogether.\n Suddenly, with a surprising abruptness, he jerked away and shoved me down. At first, I thought it was just more of the foreplay between us, until I realized he was purposely pushing me away.\n \"No,\" he said, voice hard. \"Not yet. Not until you\u0027re awakened.\"\n \"Why?\" I asked desperately. I couldn\u0027t think of anything except him touching me-and, well, another bite. \"Why does it matter? Is there... is there a reason we can\u0027t?\" Until I\u0027d come here, sex with a Strigoi had never occurred to me...maybe it just wasn\u0027t possible.\n He leaned toward me, putting his lips near my ear. \"No, but it\u0027ll be so much better if you\u0027re awakened. Let me do it... let me do it, and then we can do anything we want...\"\n It was a bargaining chip, I realized vaguely. He wanted me-it was written all over him-but he was using the lure of sex to get me to give in. And honestly? I was this close to accepting. My body was overriding my mind-nearly.\n \"No,\" I whimpered. \"I... I\u0027m scared...\"\n That dangerous look softened, and while he didn\u0027t exactly look like the Dimitri from before, there was something a little less Strigoi about him.\n \"Rose, do you think I\u0027d do anything that would hurt you?\" Somewhere, hadn\u0027t there been a discussion about how my options were to turn or die?\n The latter seemed like it might hurt, but I didn\u0027t mention that just now.\n \"The bite... the turning would hurt...\"\n \"I told you: It\u0027ll be just like what we\u0027ve already done. You\u0027ll enjoy it. It won\u0027t hurt, I swear it.\"\n I looked away. Damn it. Why couldn\u0027t he still be sinister and scary? It was so much easier to put my foot down and resist. Even in the heat of passion, I was able to resist. But somehow... seeing him like this, calm and reasonable... well, it was too close to the Dimitri I\u0027d loved. And that was hard to turn away from. For the first time, it made turning Strigoi seem... not so bad.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said lamely.\n He released me and sat up, frustration filling his features. It was almost a relief. \"Galina\u0027s patience is running out. So is mine.\"\n \"You said we still have time... I just need to think more...\" How long could I use that excuse? The narrowing of his eyes told me not much longer.\n \"I have to go,\" he said harshly. There would be no more touching or kissing, I could tell. \"I need to deal with some things.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, both confused and afraid. I didn\u0027t know which Dimitri I wanted. The terrifying one, the sensual one, or the almost-but still not quite-gentle one.\n He said nothing. Without any other warning, he leaned down and bit into the tender skin of my throat. Whatever feeble escape strategies I had were gone. I closed my eyes, nearly falling over, and only his arm wrapped firmly around me kept me upright. Just like when we kissed, his mouth was warm against my flesh, and the feel of his tongue and teeth sent electricity through me.\n And like that, it was over. He pulled away, licking his lips as he still continued to hold onto me. The fog was back. The world was wonderful and happy and I was without any cares. Whatever he\u0027d been worrying about with Nathan and Galina meant nothing to me. The fear I\u0027d felt moments ago... my disappointment over sex... my confusion-I didn\u0027t have time to worry about any of that, not when life was so beautiful and I loved Dimitri so much. I smiled up at him and tried to hug him again, but he was already leading me to the couch.\n \"I\u0027ll see you later.\" In a flash, he was at the door, which saddened me. I wanted him to stay. Stay forever. \"Remember, I want you-and I would never let anything bad happen to you. I\u0027ll protect you. But... I can\u0027t wait much longer.\"\n With that, he left. His words made me smile more broadly. Dimitri wanted me. Vaguely, I recalled asking him outside why he wanted me. Why on earth had I asked? What answer had I wanted? Why did it matter? He wanted me. That was what counted.\n That thought and the wonderful endorphin rush enveloped me as I lay on the couch, and I felt drowsiness overtaking me. Walking over to the bed seemed like too much work, so I stayed where I was and just let sleep come.\n And, unexpectedly, I found myself in one of Adrian\u0027s dreams.\n I\u0027d pretty much given up on him. After my first desperate attempts at escape in the suite, I\u0027d finally convinced myself that Adrian wasn\u0027t coming back, that I\u0027d sent him away for good. Yet here he was, standing right in front of me-or, well, at least his dream version was. Often we were in the woods or a garden, but today we stood where we\u0027d first met, on the porch of an Idaho ski lodge. Sun shone down, and mountains soared off to the side of us.\n I grinned broadly. \"Adrian!\"\n I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever seen him look as surprised as he did just then. Considering how mean I usually was to him, I could understand his feelings.\n \"Hello, Rose,\" he said. His voice sounded uncertain, like he was worried I might be playing a trick on him.\n \"You look good today,\" I told him. It was true. He wore dark jeans and a printed button-down shirt in shades of navy and turquoise that looked fantastic with his dark green eyes. Those eyes, however, looked weary. Worn. That was a little odd. In these dreams, he could shape the world and even our appearances to what he wanted, with only a little effort. He could have looked perfect but instead appeared to be reflecting real-world fatigue.\n \"So do you.\" His voice was still wary, as he eyed me from head to toe. I was still in the clingy sundress, my hair down and loose, the sapphires around my neck. \"That looks like something I\u0027d normally dress you in. Are you asleep in that?\"\n \"Yup.\" I smoothed down the dress\u0027s skirt, thinking how pretty it looked. I wondered if Dimitri had liked it. He hadn\u0027t said so specifically, but he had kept telling me I was beautiful. \"I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d come back.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t think I would either.\"\n I looked back up at him. He wasn\u0027t like his usual self at all. \"Are you trying to figure out where I am again?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t care about that anymore.\" He sighed. \"The only thing I care about is that you aren\u0027t here. You have to come back, Rose.\"\n I crossed my arms and flounced onto the porch\u0027s railing. \"Adrian, I\u0027m not ready for anything romant-\"\n \"Not for me,\" he exclaimed. \"For her. You have to come back for Lissa. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Lissa...\"\n My waking self was pumped full of endorphins, and it carried over here. I tried to remember why I should be so worried about Lissa.\n Adrian took a step forward and studied me carefully. \"Yeah, you know, Lissa? Your best friend? The one you\u0027re bonded to and sworn to protect?\"\n I swung my legs back and forth. \"I never made any vows.\"\n \"What the hell\u0027s the matter with you?\"\n I didn\u0027t like his agitated tone. It was ruining my good mood. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\"\n \"You aren\u0027t acting like yourself. Your aura...\" He frowned, unable to continue.\n I laughed. \"Oh yes. Here it comes. The magical, mystical aura. Let me guess. It\u0027s black, right?\"\n \"No... it...\" He continued scrutinizing me for several heavy seconds. \"I can barely get a fix on it. It\u0027s all over the place. What\u0027s going on, Rose?\n What\u0027s happening in the waking world?\"\n \"Nothing\u0027s happening,\" I said. \"Nothing except me being happy for the first time in my life. Why are you acting weird all of a sudden? You used to be fun. Figures the first time I\u0027m finally having a good time, you go all boring and strange.\"\n He knelt down in front of me, no trace of humor anywhere. \"There\u0027s something wrong with you. I can\u0027t tell what-\"\n \"I told you, I\u0027m fine. Why do you have to keep coming and trying to ruin things for me?\" True, I\u0027d desperately wanted him to come a little while ago, but now... well, that wasn\u0027t so important. I had a good thing with Dimitri here, if only I could figure out how to solve all the not-so-good parts.\n \"I told you, I\u0027m not here for me. I\u0027m here for Lissa.\" He looked up at me, wide-eyed and earnest. \"Rose, I am begging you to come home. Lissa needs you. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s wrong, and I don\u0027t know how to help her. No one else does either. I think... I think only you can. Maybe being apart is what\u0027s hurting her. Maybe that\u0027s what\u0027s wrong with you now, why you\u0027re acting so weird. Come home. Please. We\u0027ll heal both of you. We\u0027ll all figure it out together. She\u0027s acting so strange. She\u0027s reckless and doesn\u0027t care about anything.\"\n I shook my head. \"Being away isn\u0027t what\u0027s wrong with me. Probably not what\u0027s wrong with her, either. If she\u0027s really worried about spirit, she should go back on her meds.\"\n \"She\u0027s not worried; that\u0027s the problem. Damn it.\" He stood up and began pacing. \"What\u0027s wrong with you two? Why can\u0027t either of you see there\u0027s something the matter?\"\n \"Maybe it\u0027s not us,\" I said. \"Maybe it\u0027s you imagining things.\"\n Adrian turned back toward me and looked me over again. \"No. It\u0027s not me.\"\n I didn\u0027t like any of this-not his tone, expression, or words. I\u0027d been excited to see him, but now I resented him ruining my good mood. I didn\u0027t want to think about any of this. It was too hard.\n \"Look,\" I said. \"I was happy to see you tonight but not anymore, not if you\u0027re going to sit and accuse me and make demands.\"\n \"I\u0027m not trying to do that.\" His voice was gentle-the anger was gone. \"The last thing I want is to make you unhappy. I care about you. I care about Lissa, too. I want you both to be happy and live your lives like you want... but not when you\u0027re both heading down destructive paths.\"\n He almost made sense. Almost seemed reasonable and sincere. I shook my head.\n \"Stay out of it. I\u0027m where I want to be, and I\u0027m not coming back. Lissa\u0027s on her own.\" I jumped off the rail. The world swirled a little, and I stumbled. Adrian caught my hand, and I jerked away. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"You are not. Jesus Christ. I\u0027d swear you\u0027re drunk, except... the aura\u0027s still not right for that. What is it?\" He ran his hands through his dark hair.\n It was his typical sign of agitation.\n \"I\u0027m done here,\" I said, trying to be as polite as possible. Why on earth had I wanted to see him again? It had seemed so important when I first arrived. \"Send me back, please.\"\n He opened his mouth to say something, then froze a few moments. \"What\u0027s on your neck?\"\n He reached forward, and addled or no, I managed to dodge pretty efficiently. I had no idea what he saw on my neck, and I had no interest in finding out. \"Don\u0027t touch me.\"\n \"Rose, that looks like-\"\n \"Send me back, Adrian!\" So much for my politeness.\n \"Rose, let me help-\"\n \"Send. Me. Back!\"\n I shouted the words, and then, for the first time, I managed to pull myself out of Adrian\u0027s dream. I left sleep altogether and woke up on the couch.\n The room was still and silent, the only sound my rapid breathing. I felt all tangled up inside. Usually, so fresh from a bite, I would be floating and gleeful. Yet, the encounter with Adrian had left part of me troubled and sad.\n Standing up, I managed to make my way to the bathroom. I flicked on the light and winced. It hadn\u0027t been very bright in the other room. Once my eyes adjusted, I leaned toward the mirror and pushed my hair out of the way. I gasped at what I saw. There were bruises all over my neck, as well as signs of fresher wounds. Around where Dimitri had just bitten me, I could see dried blood.\n I looked... like a blood whore.\n How had I never noticed this before? I wet a washcloth and scrubbed at my neck, trying to get the blood off. I rubbed and rubbed until the skin turned pink. Was that it? Were there more? That looked like the worst of it. I wondered how much Adrian had seen. My hair had been down, and I was pretty sure most of it had covered my neck.\n A rebellious thought came to my head. What did it matter if Adrian saw or not? He didn\u0027t understand. There was no way he could even come close.\n I was with Dimitri. Yeah, he was different... but not that much different. And I was sure I could find a way to make this work without becoming a Strigoi. I just didn\u0027t know how yet.\n I tried to reassure myself over and over, but those bruises kept staring back at me.\n I left the bathroom and returned to the couch. I turned on the TV without really watching, and after a while, the happy fog rolled over me again. I soon tuned out the TV and returned to sleep. This time, my dreams were my own.\n It took a while for Dimitri to come again. And by \"a while,\" I mean almost an entire day. I was getting twitchy by that point, both because I missed him and because I missed the bite. He usually visited twice a day, so this was the longest I\u0027d gone without the endorphins. Needing something to do, I preoccupied myself with making myself as beautiful as possible.\n I sorted through the dresses in my closet, choosing a long ivory silk one that had purple flowers delicately painted into the fabric. It fit like a glove.\n I wanted to wear my hair up, but after looking at the bruises again, I decided to wear it down. I\u0027d been provided with a curling iron and makeup recently, so I worked my hair over carefully, turning the ends up in perfect little curls. Once made up, I stared happily at my reflection, certain Dimitri would be happy too. All I needed now was to put on some of the exquisite jewelry he\u0027d given me. But when I turned to leave, I caught a glimpse of my back from the side and saw I\u0027d missed fastening a clasp. I reached around to do it but couldn\u0027t get a hold of it. It was in that perfect spot just out of my reach.\n \"Damn,\" I muttered, still grappling with the hook. The flaw in my perfection.\n Just then, I heard the door open in the other room, followed by the telltale sound of a tray being set on the coffee table. A stroke of luck.\n \"Inna!\" I called, walking out of the bathroom. \"I need you to-\"\n Nausea rolled through me, and as I stepped into the living room, I saw that Dimitri wasn\u0027t the source. Nathan was.\n My jaw dropped open. Inna stood near him, waiting patiently by the tray, eyes downcast as always. I immediately ignored her and then looked back at Nathan. Presumably, he was still on guard duty, but that had never actually included him coming inside. For the first time in a while, some of my battle instincts kicked in, assessing escape options. My fear urged me to back away, but that would trap me in the bathroom. Best to stay where I was. Even if I couldn\u0027t leave the room, this gave me the most space to maneuver.\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, surprised at how calm I sounded.\n \"Taking care of a problem.\"\n I didn\u0027t really need any pointers to figure out the subtext here. I was the problem.\n Again, I fought the urge to back up. \"I\u0027ve never done anything to you.\" It was faulty logic to a Strigoi. None of their victims ever did anything to them.\n \"You exist,\" he said. \"You\u0027re taking up space here, wasting everyone\u0027s time. You know how to find her-the Dragomir girl-yet you\u0027ll offer nothing remotely useful until Belikov gets off his ass and awakens you. And in the meantime, Galina forces me to waste time watching you and keeps promoting him because he\u0027s convinced her that you\u0027re going to be some amazing asset to us.\"\n It was an interesting set of grievances. \"So... um, what are you going to do?\"\n In a flash, he stood in front of me. Seeing him so close triggered that memory in my mind\u0027s eye-him biting Dimitri and starting all of this. A spark of anger kindled in me but didn\u0027t do much in the way of development. \"I\u0027m getting the information one way or another,\" he hissed. \"Tell me where she is.\"\n \"You know where she is. She\u0027s at the school.\" There was nothing useful in giving up that news. He knew she was there. He knew where the school was.\n The look he gave me showed he was not happy about me providing knowledge he already had. Reaching out, he gripped my hair and jerked my head painfully back. Wearing my hair down maybe hadn\u0027t been so useful after all. \"Where is she going? She won\u0027t stay there forever. Is she going to college? The\n Royal Court\n ? They must have made plans for her.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what they are. I\u0027ve been away for a while.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" he snarled. \"She\u0027s too valuable. Her future would have been planned out a while ago.\"\n \"If it is, no one\u0027s shared it with me. I left too soon.\"\n I shrugged by way of answer. Rage filled his eyes, and I swear, they grew redder.\n \"You\u0027re bonded! You know. Tell me now, and I\u0027ll kill you quickly. If you don\u0027t, I\u0027ll awaken you to get the information, and then I\u0027ll kill you. I\u0027ll light you up like a bonfire.\"\n \"You... you\u0027d kill me once I was one of you?\" Foolish question. Strigoi felt no loyalty to each other.\n \"Yes. It\u0027ll destroy him, and once Galina sees how unhinged he is, I will return to my original place by her side-especially after I stamp out the Dragomir line.\"\n \"The hell you will.\"\n He smiled and touched my face, running his fingers along my neck and the bruises all over it. \"Oh, I will. It really will make things easier if you just tell me now. You\u0027ll die in ecstasy rather than being burned alive. We\u0027ll both enjoy it.\" He wrapped his hand delicately around my throat. \"You\u0027re definitely a problem, but you are beautiful-especially your throat. I can see why he wants you...\"\n Warring emotions played within me. Logically, I knew this was Nathan-Nathan, whom I hated for having turned Dimitri in the first place. Yet my body\u0027s need for Strigoi endorphins was raising its head too, and it barely mattered that it was Nathan. What mattered was that his teeth were only a breath away from my neck, promising that sweet, sweet delirium.\n And while one hand held my throat, the other ran down my waist, down to the curve of my hip. There had been a sultry edge to Nathan\u0027s voice, like he wanted to do more than just bite me. And after so many sexually charged encounters with Dimitri-encounters that never resulted in anything-my body almost didn\u0027t care who touched it. I could close my eyes, and it wouldn\u0027t matter whose teeth bit into me or whose hands peeled off my clothes. Only the next fix would matter. I could close my eyes and pretend it was Dimitri, lost in it all as Nathan\u0027s lips brushed my skin...\n Except, as some small reasonable part of me recalled, Nathan didn\u0027t just want sex and blood. He eventually wanted to kill me.\n Which was kind of ironic. I\u0027d been dead set-no pun intended-on killing myself when I got here, lest I become a Strigoi. Nathan was offering me that now. Even if he turned me first, he planned on killing me immediately afterward. Either way, I wouldn\u0027t have to spend eternity as a Strigoi. I should have welcomed this.\n But just then, as my body\u0027s addiction screamed for his bite and that bliss, I realized something with startling clarity: I didn\u0027t want to die. Maybe it was because I\u0027d gone almost a day without a bite, but something small and rebellious woke up in me. I would not let him do this to me. I would not let him go after Dimitri. And I sure as hell wasn\u0027t going to let him hunt down Lissa.\n Pushing through that endorphin cloud that still hung around me, I summoned up as much willpower as I could. I dug deep, remembering my years of training and all the lessons Dimitri had given me. It was hard to access those memories, and I only touched a few. Still, enough came to spur me to action. I lunged forward and punched Nathan.\n And accomplished nothing.\n He didn\u0027t budge. Hell, I don\u0027t even know if he felt it. The surprise on his face promptly turned to mirth, and he laughed in that horrible way Strigoi did-cruelly and without any real joy. Then, with the greatest of ease, he slapped me and knocked me across the room. Dimitri had done nearly the same thing when I\u0027d arrived and attacked him. Only I hadn\u0027t flown quite as far or had so miniscule an effect on him.\n I slammed into the back of the couch, and good God, did it hurt. A wave of dizziness washed over me, and I realized the idiocy of fighting someone vastly stronger than me when I\u0027d been losing blood all week. I managed to straighten up and desperately sought my next course of action. Nathan, for his part, seemed in no hurry to respond to my attack. In fact, he was still laughing.\n Glancing around, I latched onto a truly pitiful course of action. Inna stood near me. Moving with a speed that was painfully slow-but better than I expected myself to manage-I reached for her and wrapped my arm around her neck. She yelped in surprise, and I jerked her harder against me.\n \"Get out of here,\" I said to Nathan. \"Get out of here, or I\u0027ll kill her.\"\n He stopped laughing, stared at me for a moment, and then laughed even harder. \"Are you serious? Do you honestly think I couldn\u0027t stop you if I wanted? And do you honestly think I care? Go ahead. Kill her. There are dozens more just like her.\"\n Yeah, that really shouldn\u0027t have been a surprise either, but even I was a bit taken aback by how easily he could throw away a faithful servant\u0027s life.\n Okay. Time to go to Plan B. Or maybe it was Plan J? Frankly, I was losing track, and none of them were very good anyway \"Ow!\"\n Inna suddenly elbowed me in the stomach. I released her in my surprise. She spun around with a strangled scream and socked me in the face. The blow wasn\u0027t as hard as Nathan\u0027s had been, but it still knocked me over. I tried to catch a hold of something-anything-as I fell but failed. I hit the floor, my back slamming against the door. I expected her to come right back at me, but instead, she darted across the room and-God help us all threw herself into a defensive posture in front of Nathan.\n Before I could fully process the weirdness of her trying to protect someone who was willing to let her die, the door suddenly opened. \"Ow!\" I said again, as it hit me and pushed me aside.\n Dimitri swiftly entered. He looked from face to face, and I had no doubt mine showed signs of both Nathan\u0027s and Inna\u0027s attacks. Dimitri\u0027s fists clenched, and he turned toward Nathan. It reminded me of their scuffle in the hallway, all rage and malice and bloodlust. I cringed, bracing myself for another horrible confrontation.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" warned Nathan, face smug. \"You know what Galina said. Touch me and you\u0027re out of here.\"\n Dimitri strode across the room and came to stand in front of Nathan, knocking Inna aside like a rag doll. \"It\u0027ll be worth facing her wrath, particularly when I tell her you attacked first. Rose certainly bears the marks of it.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t.\" He pointed at Inna, who was sitting dazed on the floor from where Dimitri had knocked her over. Despite my own injuries, I began crawling over to her. I had to know if she was all right. \"She\u0027ll tell the truth.\"\n Now Dimitri looked smug. \"You really think Galina will believe a human? No. When I tell her how you attacked me and Rose out of jealousy, she\u0027ll let me off. The fact that you\u0027ll be so easily defeated will be proof of your weakness. I\u0027ll slice your head off and get Rose\u0027s stake from the vault. With your last breath, you can watch her drive it through your heart.\"\n Holy crap. That was a little worse than Nathan threatening to burn me-wait.\n My stake?\n Nathan\u0027s face still bore haughty arrogance-at least to me. But I think Dimitri must have seen something that satisfied him, something that made him think he\u0027d gotten the upper hand. He visibly relaxed, his smirk growing larger. \"Twice,\" Dimitri said softly. \"Twice I\u0027ve let you go. Next time... next time, you\u0027re gone.\"\n I reached Inna and gently held out my hand. \"Are you okay?\" I murmured.\n With a look of hate, she recoiled and scooted away. Nathan\u0027s eyes fell on me, and he began backing toward the door.\n \"No,\" he said. \"Twice I\u0027ve let her live. Next time she\u0027s gone. I\u0027m the one in control here, not you.\"\n Nathan opened the door and Inna stood up, stumbling after him. I stared, mouth agape at the events that had just taken place. I didn\u0027t know which of them I found more disturbing. Looking up at Dimitri, I grappled with what to ask him first. What were we going to do? Why had Inna defended Nathan? Why had Dimitri let him go? None of those defiant questions came to my lips, though.\n Instead, I burst into tears. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-22.html","bookId":2063,"book":{"id":2063,"title":"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 4: Blood Promise \n The heart of the story focuses on the hero Rose Hathaway\u0027s journey to fulfill the promise she made to herself and Dimitri.

Richelle Mead\u0027s writing has grown more sophisticated and despite the dark setting is full of humor and will make you race through the pages, leaving yourself blinking at the last page wondering where all the time went.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:26 AM"}}
