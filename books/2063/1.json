One of the lines was, \"If your eyes weren\u0027t open, you wouldn\u0027t know the difference between dreaming and waking.\" It hadn\u0027t meant much to me at the time. After all, there\u0027d been a guy in the class that I liked, so how could I be expected to pay attention to literary analysis? Now, three years later, I understood the poem perfectly.\\n\\n Because lately, my life really did seem like it was on the precipice of being a dream. There were days I thought I\u0027d wake up and discover that recent events in my life hadn\u0027t actually happened. Surely I must be a princess in an enchanted sleep. Any day now, this dream-no, nightmare would end, and I\u0027d get my prince and happy ending.\\n\\n But there was no happy ending to be found, at least not in the foreseeable future. And my prince? Well, that was a long story. My prince had been turned into a vampire-a Strigoi, to be specific. In my world, there are two kinds of vampires who exist in secrecy from humans. The Moroi are living vampires, good vampires who wield elemental magic and don\u0027t kill when seeking the blood they need to survive. Strigoi are undead vampires, immortal and twisted, who kill when they feed. Moroi are born. Strigoi are made-forcibly or by choice-through evil means.\\n\\n And Dimitri, the guy I loved, had been made a Strigoi against his will. He\u0027d been turned during a battle, an epic rescue mission that I\u0027d been part of as well. Strigoi had kidnapped Moroi and dhampirs from the school I attended, and we\u0027d set out with others to save them. Dhampirs are half vampire and half-human-gifted with human strength and hardiness, and Moroi reflexes and senses. Dhampirs train to become guardians, the elite bodyguards who protect Moroi. That\u0027s what I am. That\u0027s what Dimitri had been.\\n\\n After his conversion, the rest of the Moroi world had considered him dead. And to a certain extent, he was. Those who were turned Strigoi lost all sense of the goodness and life they\u0027d had before. Even if they hadn\u0027t turned by choice, it didn\u0027t matter. They would still become evil and cruel, just like all Strigoi. The person they\u0027d been was gone, and honestly, it was easier to imagine them moving on to heaven or the next life than to picture them out stalking the night and taking victims. But I hadn\u0027t been able to forget Dimitri, or accept that he was essentially dead. He was the man I loved, the man with whom I\u0027d been so perfectly in sync that it was hard to know where I ended and he began. My heart refused to let him go even if he was technically a monster, he was still out there somewhere. I also hadn\u0027t forgotten a conversation he and I had once had. We\u0027d both agreed that we\u0027d rather be dead-truly dead-than walk the world as Strigoi.\\n\\n And once I\u0027d had my mourning time for the goodness he\u0027d lost, I\u0027d decided I had to honor his wishes. Even if he no longer believed in them. I had to find him. I had to kill him and free his soul from that dark, unnatural state. I knew it was what the Dimitri I had loved would have wanted. Killing Strigoi isn\u0027t easy, though. They\u0027re insanely fast and strong. They have no mercy. I\u0027d killed a number of them already-pretty crazy for someone who was freshly eighteen. And I knew taking on Dimitri would be my greatest challenge, both physically and emotionally.\\n\\n In fact, the emotional consequences had kicked in as soon as I made my decision. Going after Dimitri had meant doing a few life-altering things (and that wasn\u0027t even counting the fact that fighting him could very likely result in the loss of my life). I was still in school, only a handful of months away from graduating and becoming a full-fledged guardian. Every day I stuck around at St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy-a remote, protected school for Moroi and dhampirs-meant one more day was going by in which Dimitri was still out there, living in the state he\u0027d never wanted. I loved him too much to allow that. So I\u0027d had to leave school early and go out among humans, abandoning the world I\u0027d lived in nearly my entire life.\\n\\n Leaving had also meant abandoning one other thing-or rather, a person: my best friend, Lissa, also known as Vasilisa Dragomir. Lissa was Moroi, the last in a royal line. I\u0027d been slated to be her guardian when we graduated, and my decision to hunt Dimitri had pretty much destroyed that future with her. I\u0027d had no choice but to leave her.\\n\\n Aside from our friendship, Lissa and I had a unique connection. Each Moroi specializes in a type of elemental magic-earth, air, water, or fire. Until recently, we\u0027d believed there were only those four elements. Then we\u0027d discovered a fifth: spirit.\\n\\n That was Lissa\u0027s element, and with so few spirit users in the world, we hardly knew anything about it. For the most part, it seemed to be tied to psychic powers. Lissa wielded amazing compulsion-the ability to exert her will on almost anyone. She could also heal, and that\u0027s where things got a little strange between us. You see, I technically died in the car accident that killed her family. Lissa had brought me back from the world of the dead without realizing it, creating a psychic bond between us. Ever since then, I was always aware of her presence and thoughts. I could tell what she was thinking and feel when she was in trouble. We had also recently discovered I could see ghosts and spirits who hadn\u0027t yet left this world, something I found disconcerting and struggled to block out. The whole phenomenon was called being shadow-kissed.\\n\\n Our shadow-kissed bond made me the ideal choice to protect Lissa, since I would instantly know if she was in trouble. I\u0027d promised to protect her my whole life, but then Dimitri-tall, gorgeous, fierce Dimitri-had changed it all. I\u0027d been faced with that horrible choice: continue to protect Lissa or free Dimitri\u0027s soul. Choosing between them had broken my heart, leaving an ache in my chest and tears in my eyes. My parting with Lissa had been agonizing. We\u0027d been best friends since kindergarten, and my departure was a shock for both of us. To be fair, she\u0027d never seen it coming. I\u0027d kept my romance with Dimitri a secret. He was my instructor, seven years older than me, and had been assigned to be her guardian as well. As such, he and I had tried hard to fight our attraction, knowing we had to focus on Lissa more than anything else and that we\u0027d also get in a fair amount of trouble for our student-teacher relationship.\\n\\n But being kept from Dimitri-even though I\u0027d agreed to it-had caused me to build up a lot of unspoken resentment toward Lissa. I probably should have talked to her about it and explained my frustration over having my entire life planned out. It didn\u0027t seem fair, somehow, that while Lissa was free to live and love however she wanted, I would always have to sacrifice my own happiness to ensure that she was protected. She was my best friend, though, and I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of upsetting her. Lissa was particularly vulnerable because using spirit had the nasty side effect of driving people insane. So I\u0027d sat on my feelings until they finally exploded, and I left the Academy-and her-behind for good.\\n\\n One of the ghosts I\u0027d seen-Mason, a friend who had been killed by Strigoi-had told me Dimitri had returned to his homeland: Siberia. Mason\u0027s soul had found peace and left this world shortly thereafter, without giving me any other clues about where in Siberia Dimitri might have gone. So I\u0027d had to set out there blindly, braving a world of humans and a language I didn\u0027t know in order to fulfill the promise I\u0027d made to myself.\\n\\n After a few weeks on my own, I had finally made it to Saint Petersburg. I was still looking, still floundering-but determined to find him, even though I dreaded it at the same time. Because if I really did pull this insane plan off, if I actually managed to kill the man I loved, it would mean Dimitri would truly be gone from the world. And I honestly wasn\u0027t sure I could go on in a world like that.\\n\\n None of it seems real. Who knows? Maybe it isn\u0027t. Maybe it\u0027s actually happening to someone else. Maybe it\u0027s something I imagined. Maybe soon I\u0027m going to wake up and find everything fixed with Lissa and Dimitri. We\u0027ll all be together, and he\u0027ll be there to smile and hold me and tell me everything\u0027s going to be okay. Maybe all of this really has been a dream.\\n\\n But I don\u0027t think so. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-1.html","bookId":2063,"book":{"id":2063,"title":"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy #4)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 4: Blood Promise \\n The heart of the story focuses on the hero Rose Hathaway\u0027s journey to fulfill the promise she made to herself and Dimitri.
