{"id":110811,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Wait-what?\" I exclaimed. That wasn\u0027t in the plan. That wasn\u0027t in the plan at all. I was trying to move through Russia in as incognito a way as possible. Plus, I didn\u0027t really relish the thought of having a tagalong-particularly one who appeared to hate me. I didn\u0027t know how long it would take to get to Siberia-a couple days, I thought-and I couldn\u0027t imagine spending them listening to Sydney talk about what an unnatural, evil being I was. Swallowing my outrage, I attempted reason. After all, I was asking a favor here. \"That\u0027s not necessary,\" I said, forcing a smile. \"It\u0027s nice of you to offer, but I don\u0027t want to inconvenience you.\" \"Well,\" she replied dryly, \"there\u0027s no getting around that. And it\u0027s not me being nice. It\u0027s not even my choice. It\u0027s an order from my superiors.\" \"It still sounds like a pain in the ass for you. Why don\u0027t you just tell me where it is and blow them off?\" \"You obviously don\u0027t know the people I work for.\" \"Don\u0027t need to. I ignore authority all the time. It\u0027s not hard once you get used to it.\" \"Yeah? How\u0027s that working out for you with finding this village?\" she asked mockingly. \"Look, if you want to get there, this is the only way.\" Well-it was the only way I could get there if I used Sydney for information. I could always go back to staking out the Nightingale... but it had taken me this long to get a lead from there. Meanwhile, she was here right in front of me with the information I needed. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Why do you have to go too?\" \"I can\u0027t tell you that. Bottom line: They told me to.\" Lovely. I eyed her, trying to figure out what was going on here. Why on earth would anyone-let alone humans with their hands in the Moroi world -care where one teenage dhampir went? I didn\u0027t think Sydney had any ulterior motives-unless she was a very, very good actress. Yet, clearly the people she answered to had an agenda, and I didn\u0027t like playing into anyone\u0027s plan. At the same time, I was anxious to get on with this. Each day that passed was another in which I didn\u0027t find Dimitri. \"How soon can we leave?\" I asked at last. Sydney, I decided, was a paper-pusher. She\u0027d shown no real skill in tracking me earlier. Surely it wouldn\u0027t be that hard to ditch her once we were near enough to Dimitri\u0027s town. She looked kind of disappointed at my response, almost as though she\u0027d hoped I would decline and then she\u0027d be off the hook. She didn\u0027t want to come with me any more than I wanted her to. Opening her purse, she took out her cell phone again, fiddled with it a couple of minutes, and finally produced some train times. She showed me the schedule for the next day. \"Does that work for you?\" I studied the screen and nodded. \"I know where that station is. I can be there.\" \"Okay.\" She stood up and tossed some cash on the table. \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow.\" She started to walk away and then glanced back at me. \"Oh, and you can have the rest of my fries.\" When I first came to Russia, I stayed in youth hostels. I\u0027d certainly had the money to stay elsewhere, but I wanted to remain under the radar. Besides, luxury hadn\u0027t really been the first thing on my mind. When I began going to the Nightingale, however, I found I could hardly return to a boarding house of backpacking students while wearing a designer dress. So I was now staying at a posh hotel, complete with guys who always held the doors open and a marble-floored lobby. That lobby was so big that I think an entire hostel could have fit in it. Maybe two hostels. My room was large and overdone too, and I was grateful to reach it and change out of the heels and dress. I realized with only a small pang of regret that I\u0027d have to leave the dresses I\u0027d bought in Saint Petersburg behind. I wanted to keep my luggage light while jaunting around the country, and even if my backpack was large, there was only so much I could carry. Oh well. Those dresses would make some cleaning woman\u0027s day, no doubt. The only bit of ornamentation I really needed was my nazar, a pendant that looked like a blue eye. It had been a gift from my mother, which had in turn been a gift from my father. I always wore it around my neck. Our train for Moscow left late in the morning, and we would then catch a cross-country train to Siberia. I wanted to be well rested and ready for it all. Once in my pajamas, I snuggled under the bed\u0027s heavy comforter and hoped sleep would come soon. Instead, my mind spun with all the things that had happened recently. The Sydney situation was a bizarre twist but one I could handle. As long as we stuck to public transportation, she could hardly lead me into the clutches of her mysterious superiors. And from what she\u0027d said about our travel time, it would indeed only take a couple of days or so to reach the village. Two days seemed both impossibly long and impossibly short. It meant I could very well be confronting Dimitri in a few days... and then what? Could I do it? Could I bring myself to kill him? And even if I decided I could, would I actually have the skill to overpower him? The same questions that I\u0027d been asking myself for the last two weeks kept plaguing me over and over. Dimitri had taught me everything I knew, and with enhanced Strigoi reflexes, he would truly be the god I\u0027d always joked he was. Death was a very real possibility for me. But worrying wasn\u0027t helpful right now and, looking over at the clock in the room, I discovered I\u0027d been lying awake for almost an hour. That was no good. I needed to be in peak condition. So I did something I knew I shouldn\u0027t do, but which always worked to get my mind off my worries-largely because it involved me being in someone else\u0027s mind. Slipping inside Lissa\u0027s head required only a small amount of concentration on my part. I hadn\u0027t known if I could do it when we were far apart, but I\u0027d discovered the process was no different than if I were standing right beside her. It was late morning back in Montana, and Lissa had no classes today since it was Saturday. During my time away, I\u0027d worked very hard to put up mental walls between us, almost completely blocking her and her feelings out. Now, inside her, all the barriers were down, and her emotions hit me like a tidal wave. She was pissed off. Really pissed off. \"Why does she think she can just snap her fingers and get me to go anywhere she wants, anytime she wants?\" Lissa growled. \"Because she\u0027s the queen. And because you made a deal with the devil.\" Lissa and her boyfriend, Christian, were lounging in the attic of the school\u0027s chapel. As soon as I recognized the surroundings, I nearly pulled out of her head. The two of them had had way too many \"romantic\" encounters up here, and I didn\u0027t want to stick around if clothes were going to be ripped off soon. Fortunately-or perhaps not-her annoyed feelings told me there\u0027d be no sex today, not with her bad mood. It was kind of ironic, actually. Their roles were reversed. Lissa was the raging one while Christian remained cool and collected, trying to appear calm for her sake. He sat on the floor, leaning up against the wall, while she sat in front of him, his legs apart and his arms holding her. She rested her head on his chest and sighed. \"For the last few weeks, I\u0027ve done everything she\u0027s asked! ¡®Vasilisa, please show this stupid visiting royal around campus.\u0027 ¡®Vasilisa, please jump on a plane for the weekend so that I can introduce you to some boring officials here at Court.\u0027 ¡®Vasilisa, please put in some volunteer time with the younger students. It looks good.\u0027\" Despite Lissa\u0027s frustration, I couldn\u0027t help a little amusement. She had Queen Tatiana\u0027s voice down perfectly. \"You would have done that last one willingly,\" Christian pointed out. \"Yeah... the point being willingly. I hate her trying to dictate every part of my life lately.\" Christian leaned over and kissed her cheek. \"Like I said, you made a deal with the devil. You\u0027re her darling now. She wants to make sure you\u0027re making her look good.\" Lissa scowled. Although Moroi lived inside human-run countries and were subject to those governments, they were also ruled by a king or queen who came from one of the twelve royal Moroi families. Queen Tatiana-an Ivashkov-was the current ruler, and she\u0027d taken a particular interest in Lissa as the last living member of the Dragomir family. As such, Tatiana had cut Lissa a deal. If Lissa lived at Court after graduating from St. Vladimir\u0027s, the queen would arrange for her to attend LehighUniversity in Pennsylvania. Lissa was a total brain and thought living in Tatiana\u0027s household would be worth it to attend a semi-big, prestigious university, as opposed to the tiny ones Moroi usually went to (for safety reasons). As Lissa was finding out, though, the strings attached to that deal were already in place now. \"And I just sit and take it,\" Lissa said. \"I just smile and say ¡®Yes, your majesty. Anything you want, your majesty.\u0027\" \"Then tell her the deal\u0027s off. You\u0027ll be eighteen in a couple of months. Royal or not, you\u0027re under no obligations. You don\u0027t need her to go to a big school. We\u0027ll just take off, you and me. Go to whatever college you want. Or don\u0027t go to college at all. We can run off to Paris or something and work at a little cafe. Or sell bad art on the streets.\" This actually made Lissa laugh, and she snuggled closer to Christian. \"Right. I can totally see you having the patience to wait on people. You\u0027d be fired your first day. Looks like the only way we\u0027ll survive is if I go to college and support us.\" \"There are other ways to get to college, you know.\" \"Yeah, but not to any that are this good,\" she said wistfully. \"Not easily, at least. This is the only way. I just wish I could have all this and stand up to her a little. Rose would.\" \"Rose would have gotten herself arrested for treason the first time Tatiana asked her to do something.\" Lissa smiled sadly. \"Yeah. She would have.\" The smile turned into a sigh. \"I miss her so much.\" Christian kissed her again. \"I know.\" This was a familiar conversation for them, one that never grew old because Lissa\u0027s feelings for me never faded. \"She\u0027s okay, you know. Wherever she is, she\u0027s okay.\" Lissa stared off into the attic\u0027s darkness. The only light came from a stained-glass window that made the whole place look like a fairyland. The space had been recently cleaned out-by Dimitri and me, actually. It had only been a couple of months ago, but already, dust and boxes were accumulating once more. The priest here was a nice guy but kind of a pack rat. Lissa noticed none of this, though. Her thoughts were too focused on me. \"I hope so. I wish I had some idea-any idea-where she is. I keep thinking that if anything happened to her, if she-\" Lissa couldn\u0027t finish the thought. \"Well, I keep thinking that I\u0027d know somehow. That I\u0027d feel it. I mean, I know the bond\u0027s one-way... that\u0027s never changed. But I\u0027d have to know if something happened to her, right?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Christian. \"Maybe. Maybe not.\" Any other guy would have said something overly sweet and comforting, assuring her that yes, yes, of course she\u0027d know. But it was part of Christian\u0027s nature to be brutally honest. Lissa liked that about him. So did I. It didn\u0027t always make him a pleasant friend, but at least you knew he wasn\u0027t bullshitting you. She sighed again. \"Adrian says she\u0027s okay. He visits her dreams. I\u0027d give anything to be able to do that. My healing\u0027s getting better and better, and I\u0027ve got the aura thing down. But no dreams yet.\" Knowing Lissa missed me hurt almost more than if she\u0027d completely written me off. I\u0027d never wanted to hurt her. Even when I\u0027d resented her for feeling like she was controlling my life, I\u0027d never hated her. I loved her like a sister and couldn\u0027t stand the thought of her suffering now on my behalf. How had things gotten so screwed up between us? She and Christian continued sitting there in comfortable silence, drawing strength and love from each other. They had what Dimitri and I had had, a sense of such oneness and familiarity that words often weren\u0027t needed. He ran his fingers through her hair, and while I couldn\u0027t see it so well through her own eyes, I could imagine the way that pale hair would gleam in the rainbow light of the stained-glass windows. He tucked several long locks behind her ear and then tipped her head back, bringing his lips down to hers. The kiss started off light and sweet and then slowly intensified, warmth spreading from his mouth to hers. Uh-oh, I thought. It might be time to take off after all. But she ended it before I had to. \"It\u0027s time,\" she said regretfully. \"We\u0027ve got to go.\" The look in Christian\u0027s crystal-blue eyes said otherwise. \"Maybe this is the perfect time for you to stand up to the queen. You should just stay here -it\u0027d be a great way to build character.\" Lissa lightly elbowed him and then planted a kiss on his forehead before standing up. \"That is not why you want me to stay, so don\u0027t even try to play me.\" They left the chapel, and Christian mumbled something about wanting to do more than play that earned him another elbow. They were heading toward the administration building, which was in the heart of the upper school\u0027s campus. Aside from the first blushes of spring, everything looked like it had when I\u0027d left-at least on the outside. The stone buildings remained grand and imposing. The tall, ancient trees continued their watch. Yet, inside the hearts of the staff and students, things had changed. Everyone carried scars from the attack. Many of our people had been killed, and while classes were up and running again, everyone still grieved. Lissa and Christian reached their destination: the administration building. She didn\u0027t know the reason for her summoning, only that Tatiana had wanted her to meet some royal guy who had just arrived at the Academy. Considering how many people Tatiana was always forcing her to meet lately, Lissa didn\u0027t think too much of it. She and Christian stepped inside the main office, where they found Headmistress Kirova sitting and chatting with an older Moroi and a girl about our age. \"Ah, Miss Dragomir. There you are.\" I\u0027d gotten in trouble with Kirova a lot while I\u0027d been a student, yet seeing her now made me feel kind of nostalgic. Getting suspended for starting a fight in class seemed worlds better than traipsing through Siberia to find Dimitri. Kirova had the same birdlike appearance she\u0027d always had, the same glasses balanced at the end of her nose. The man and girl stood up, and Kirova gestured to them. \"This is Eugene Lazar and his daughter Avery.\" Kirova turned back toward Lissa. \"This is Vasilisa Dragomir and Christian Ozera.\" A fair bit of sizing up went on then. Lazar was a royal name, but that was no surprise since Tatiana had initiated this meeting. Mr. Lazar gave Lissa a winning smile as he shook her hand. He seemed a bit surprised to meet Christian, but the smile stayed. Of course, that kind of reaction to Christian wasn\u0027t so unusual. The two ways to become Strigoi were by choice or by force. A Strigoi could turn another person-human, Moroi, or dhampir-by drinking their blood and then feeding Strigoi blood back to them. That was what had happened to Dimitri. The other way to become Strigoi was unique to Moroi -and it was done by choice. Moroi who purposely chose to kill a person by drinking blood would also turn Strigoi. Usually, Moroi only drank small, nonlethal amounts from willing humans. But taking so much that it destroyed another\u0027s life force? Well, that turned Moroi to the dark side, taking away their elemental magic and transforming them into the twisted undead. That was exactly what Christian\u0027s parents had done. They\u0027d willingly killed and become Strigoi to gain eternal life. Christian had never shown any desire to become Strigoi, but everyone acted as though he were about to. (Admittedly, his snarky attitude didn\u0027t always help.) A lot of his close family-despite being royal-had been unfairly shunned as well. He and I had teamed up to kick a fair amount of Strigoi ass during the attack, though. Word of that was getting around and improving his reputation. Kirova was never one to waste time with formalities, so she got straight to the point. \"Mr. Lazar is going to be the new headmaster here.\" Lissa had still been smiling at him politely, but her head immediately jerked toward Kirova. \"What?\" \"I\u0027m going to be stepping down,\" explained Kirova, voice flat and emotionless enough to rival any guardian\u0027s. \"Though I\u0027ll still be serving the school as a teacher.\" \"You\u0027re going to teach?\" Christian asked incredulously. She gave him a dry look. \"Yes, Mr. Ozera. It was what I originally went to school for. I\u0027m sure if I try hard enough, I can remember how to do it.\" \"But why?\" asked Lissa. \"You do a great job.\" It was more or less true. Despite my disputes with Kirova-usually over me breaking rules-I still had a healthy respect for her. Lissa did too. \"It\u0027s something I\u0027ve thought about returning to for some time,\" explained Kirova. \"Now seemed as good a time as any, and Mr. Lazar is a very capable administrator.\" Lissa was pretty good at reading people. I think it was part of spirit\u0027s side effects, along with how spirit made its users very, very charismatic. Lissa thought Kirova was lying, and so did I. If I\u0027d been able to read Christian\u0027s mind, my guess would have been that he felt the same way. The attack on the Academy had sent a lot of people into a panic, royals in particular, even though the problem that had led to the attack had long since been fixed. I was guessing that Tatiana\u0027s hand was at work here, forcing Kirova to step down and have a royal take her place, thus making other royals feel better. Lissa didn\u0027t let her thoughts show, and she turned back to Mr. Lazar. \"Well, it\u0027s very nice to meet you. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do a great job. Let me know if there\u0027s anything I can do for you.\" She was playing the proper princess role perfectly. Being polite and sweet was one of her many talents. \"Actually,\" said Mr. Lazar, \"there is.\" He had a deep, booming voice, the kind that filled a room. He gestured toward his daughter. \"I was wondering if you could show Avery around and help her find her way here. She graduated last year but will be assisting me in my duties. I\u0027m sure she\u0027d much rather be spending time with someone her own age, however.\" Avery smiled, and for the first time, Lissa really paid attention to her. Avery was beautiful. Stunning. Lissa was beautiful too, between that gorgeous hair and the jade green eyes that ran in her family. I thought she was a hundred times prettier than Avery, but beside the older girl, Lissa felt kind of plain. Avery was tall and slim like most Moroi but had a few sexy curves thrown in. That kind of chest, like mine, was coveted among Moroi, and her long brown hair and blue-gray eyes completed the package. \"I promise not to be too much of a pain,\" said Avery. \"And if you want, I\u0027ll give you some insider\u0027s tips on Court life. I hear you\u0027re going to be moving there.\" Instantly, Lissa\u0027s defenses went up. She realized what was going on. Not only had Tatiana ousted Kirova, she\u0027d sent a keeper for Lissa. A beautiful, perfect companion who could spy on Lissa and attempt to train her up to Tatiana\u0027s standards. Lissa\u0027s words were perfectly polite when she spoke, but there was a definite edge of frost in her voice. \"That\u0027d be great,\" she said. \"I\u0027m pretty busy lately, but we can try to make the time.\" Neither Avery\u0027s father nor Kirova seemed to notice the back off subtext, but something flashed in Avery\u0027s eyes that told Lissa the message had come through. \"Thanks,\" said Avery. Unless I was mistaken, there was some legitimate hurt in her face. \"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll figure something out.\" \"Good, good,\" said Mr. Lazar, totally oblivious to the girl drama. \"Maybe you can show Avery to guest housing? She\u0027s staying in the east wing.\" \"Sure,\" said Lissa, wishing she could do anything but that. She, Christian, and Avery started to leave, but just then, two guys entered the room. One was a Moroi, a little younger than us, and the other was a dhampir in his twenties-a guardian, from the look of his hard, serious features. \"Ah, there you are,\" said Mr. Lazar, beckoning the guys in. He rested his hand on the boy\u0027s shoulder. \"This is my son Reed. He\u0027s a junior and will be attending classes here. He\u0027s very excited about it.\" Actually, Reed looked extremely unexcited. He was pretty much the surliest guy I\u0027d ever seen. If I ever needed to play the role of a disgruntled teen, I could have learned everything there was to know about it from Reed Lazar. He had the same good looks and features as Avery, but they were marred by a grimace that seemed permanently attached to his face. Mr. Lazar introduced the others to Reed. Reed\u0027s only response was a guttural, \"Hey.\" \"And this is Simon, Avery\u0027s guardian,\" continued Mr. Lazar. \"Of course, while on campus, he doesn\u0027t need to be with her all the time. You know how it goes. Still, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll see him around.\" I hoped not. He didn\u0027t look as completely unpleasant as Reed, but he had a certain dour nature that seemed extreme even among guardians. Suddenly, I kind of felt sorry for Avery. If this was her only company, I\u0027d want to befriend someone like Lissa pretty badly. Lissa, however, made it clear that she wouldn\u0027t be part of Tatiana\u0027s schemes. With little conversation, she and Christian escorted Avery to guest housing and promptly left. Normally, Lissa would have stayed to help Avery get settled and offered to eat with her later. Not this time. Not with ulterior motives afoot. I came back to my own body, back in the hotel. I knew I shouldn\u0027t care about Academy life anymore and that I should even feel bad for Avery. Yet lying there and staring into the darkness, I couldn\u0027t help but take some smug-and yes, very selfish-satisfaction out of this encounter: Lissa wouldn\u0027t be shopping for a new best friend anytime soon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-4.html","bookId":2063,"book":{"id":2063,"title":"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy #4)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 4: Blood Promise The heart of the story focuses on the hero Rose Hathaway\u0027s journey to fulfill the promise she made to herself and Dimitri.
