{"id":110824,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"I didn\u0027t recognize the guy Sydney sent to meet us when we reached Novosibirsk, but he had the same golden tattoo that she did. He was sandy-haired and in his thirties-and human, of course. He looked competent and trustworthy, and as I leaned against the car, he laughed and spoke to the elderly couple like they\u0027d been best friends forever. There was a professional and reassuring air about him, and soon they were smiling too. I\u0027m not sure what he told them, maybe that I was his wayward daughter or something, but they apparently felt good enough to leave me in his hands. I supposed with their jobs, the Alchemist charm in action.\\n\\n When the old man and woman drove off, his demeanor shifted slightly. He didn\u0027t seem as cold as Sydney initially had, but there was no laughing or joking with me. He\u0027d become distinctly businesslike, and I couldn\u0027t help but think of the stories of men in black, the people who cleaned up after extraterrestrial encounters in order to keep the world ignorant of the truth.\\n\\n \"Can you walk?\" he asked, eyeing me up and down.\\n\\n \"Unclear at this time,\" I replied.\\n\\n It turned out I could, just not very well. With his help, I eventually ended up at a town house over in a residential part of the city. I was bleary-eyed and barely able to stay on my feet by that point. There were other people there, but none of them registered. The only thing that mattered was the bedroom someone took me to. I mustered enough strength at that point to break free of the arm supporting me and do a face-plant right in the middle of the bed. I fell asleep instantly.\\n\\n I awoke to bright sunshine filling my room and voices speaking in hushed tones. Considering everything that I\u0027d been through, I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised to see Dimitri, Tatiana, or even Dr. Olendzki from the Academy there. Instead, it was Abe\u0027s bearded face that looked down at me, the light making all of his jewelry gleam.\\n\\n For a moment, his face blurred, and all I saw was dark, dark water-water that threatened to wash me away. Dimitri\u0027s last words echoed in my head: That\u0027s what I was supposed to say... He\u0027d understood that I wanted to hear that he loved me. What would have happened if we\u0027d had a few moments more? Would he have said those words? Would he have meant them? And would it have mattered?\\n\\n With the same resolve I\u0027d mustered before, I parted the waters swirling in my mind, ordering myself to push aside last night as long as I could. I would drown if I thought about it. Now I had to swim. Abe\u0027s face came back into focus.\\n\\n \"Greetings, Zmey,\" I said weakly. Somehow, him being here didn\u0027t surprise me. Sydney would have had to tell her superiors about me, who in turn would have told Abe. \"Nice of you to slither on in.\"\\n\\n He shook his head, wearing a rueful smile. \"I think you\u0027ve outdone me when it comes to sneaking around dark corners. I thought you were on your way back to Montana.\"\\n\\n \"Next time, make sure you write a few more details into your bargains. Or just pack me up and send me back to the U.S. for real.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" he said, \"that\u0027s exactly what I intend to do.\" He kept smiling as he said it, but somehow, I had a feeling he wasn\u0027t joking. And suddenly, I no longer feared that fate. Going home was starting to sound good.\\n\\n Mark and Oksana walked over to stand beside him. Their presence was unexpected but welcome. They smiled too, faces melancholy but relieved. I sat up in bed, surprised I could move at all.\\n\\n \"You healed me,\" I said to Oksana. \"I still hurt, but I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m going to die, which I have to think is an improvement.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"I did enough to make sure you weren\u0027t in immediate danger. I figured I could do the rest when you woke up.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"No, no. I\u0027ll recover on my own.\" I always hated it when Lissa healed me. I didn\u0027t want her wasting the strength on me. I also didn\u0027t want her inviting spirit\u0027s side effects.\\n\\n Lissa...\\n\\n I jerked the covers off of me. \"Oh my God! I have to get home. Right now.\"\\n\\n Immediately, three pairs of arms blocked my way.\\n\\n \"Hold on,\" said Mark. \"You aren\u0027t going anywhere. Oksana only healed you a little. You\u0027re a long way from being recovered.\"\\n\\n \"And you still haven\u0027t told us what happened,\" said Abe, eyes as shrewd as ever. He was someone who needed to know everything, and the mysteries around me probably drove him crazy.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no time! Lissa\u0027s in trouble. I have to get back to school.\" It was all coming back to me. Lissa\u0027s erratic behavior and crazy stunts, driven by some kind of compulsion-or super-compulsion, I supposed, seeing as Avery had been able to shove me out of Lissa\u0027s head.\\n\\n \"Oh, now you want to go back to Montana?\" exclaimed Abe. \"Rose, even if there was a plane waiting for you out in the other room, that\u0027s a twenty hour trip, at minimum. And you\u0027re in no condition to go anywhere.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, still trying to get on my feet. After what I\u0027d faced last night, this group wasn\u0027t that much of a threat-well, maybe Mark was-but I could hardly start throwing punches. And yeah, I still wasn\u0027t sure what Abe could do.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t get it! Someone\u0027s trying to kill Lissa or hurt her or...\"\\n\\n Well, I didn\u0027t really understand what Avery wanted. All I knew was that Avery had somehow been compelling Lissa to do all sorts of reckless things.\\n\\n She had to be amazingly strong in spirit to not only manage those feats but also keep it hidden from Lissa and Adrian. She\u0027d even created a false aura to hide her golden one. I had no idea how that magnitude of power was possible, particularly considering that Avery\u0027s fun-loving personality could hardly be called insane. Whatever her scheme, Lissa was at risk. I had to do something.\\n\\n Removing Abe from the equation, I looked up at Mark and Oksana pleadingly. \"It\u0027s my bondmate,\" I explained. \"She\u0027s in trouble. Someone\u0027s trying to hurt her. I have to go to her-you understand why I have to.\"\\n\\n And I saw in their faces that they did understand. I also knew that in my situation, they\u0027d try exactly the same thing for each other.\\n\\n Mark sighed. \"Rose... we\u0027ll help you get to her, but we can\u0027t do it now.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll contact the school,\" said Abe matter-of-factly. \"They\u0027ll take care of it.\"\\n\\n Right. And how exactly would we do that? Call up Headmaster Lazar and tell him his party-girl daughter was actually corrupting and controlling people with psychic powers and that she needed to be locked up for Lissa\u0027s and everyone else\u0027s good?\\n\\n My lack of an answer seemed to make them think they\u0027d convinced me, Abe in particular. \"With Oksana\u0027s help, you\u0027d probably be in good enough condition to leave tomorrow,\" he added. \"I can book a morning flight the next day.\"\\n\\n \"Will she be all right until then?\" Oksana asked me gently.\\n\\n \"I... I don\u0027t know...\" What could Avery do in two days\u0027 time? Alienate and embarrass Lissa further? Horrible things, but not permanent or life threatening. Surely, surely... she\u0027d be okay that long, right? \"Let me see...\"\\n\\n I saw Mark\u0027s eyes widen slightly as he realized what I was about to do. Then I saw nothing in the room anymore because I was no longer there. I was in Lissa\u0027s head. A new set of sights settled in around me, and for half a second, I thought I stood on the bridge again and was looking down into black waters and a cold death.\\n\\n Then I gained a grip on what I saw-or rather, what Lissa saw. She was standing on the ledge of a window in some building on campus. It was nighttime. I couldn\u0027t tell offhand which building it was, but it didn\u0027t matter. Lissa was on what appeared to be the sixth floor, standing there in high heels, laughing about something while the dark ground threatened below. Behind her, I heard Avery\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Lissa, be careful! You shouldn\u0027t be up there.\"\\n\\n But it had the same double meaning that permeated everything Avery did. Even as she said those words of caution, I could feel a reckless drive within Lissa, something telling her that it was okay to be where she was and not to worry so much. It was Avery\u0027s compulsion. Then, I felt that brushing of my mind, and the annoyed voice.\\n\\n You again?\\n\\n I was forced back out, back to the bedroom in Novosibirsk. Abe was freaking out, apparently thinking I\u0027d gone into some catatonic fit, and Mark and Oksana were attempting to explain to him what had happened. I blinked and rubbed my head as I gathered myself, and Mark breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s much stranger watching someone do that than it is doing it myself.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s in trouble,\" I said, attempting to get up again. \"She\u0027s in trouble... and I don\u0027t know what to do...\"\\n\\n They were right in saying there was no way on earth I could get to Lissa anytime soon. And even if I followed Abe\u0027s suggestion and contacted the school... I didn\u0027t know for sure where Lissa was at or even if anyone there would believe me. I thought about jumping back in and trying to read Lissa\u0027s location from her mind, but Avery would likely throw me out again. From what I had briefly felt, Lissa didn\u0027t have her cell phone on her-no surprise. There were strict rules about having them in classes, so she usually left hers in her dorm room.\\n\\n But I knew someone who would have his. And who would believe me.\\n\\n \"Does anyone have a phone?\" I asked.\\n\\n Abe gave me his, and I dialed Adrian\u0027s number, surprised I had it memorized. Adrian was mad at me, but he cared about Lissa. He would help her, no matter his grudge toward me. And he would believe me when I tried to explain a crazy, spirit-induced plot.\\n\\n But when the other end of the line picked up, it was his voicemail that answered, not the man himself. \"I know how devastated you must be to miss me,\" his cheery voice said, \"but leave a message, and I\u0027ll try to ease your agony as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n I disconnected, feeling lost. Suddenly, I looked up at Oksana as one of my crazier ideas came to mind.\\n\\n \"You... you can do that thing... where you actively go in someone\u0027s mind and touch their thoughts, right? Like you did to me?\"\\n\\n She grimaced slightly. \"Yes, but it\u0027s not something I like to do. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Can you compel them once you\u0027re in there?\"\\n\\n She looked even more disgusted. \"Well, yes, of course... the two things are actually very similar. But reaching in someone\u0027s mind is one thing and forcing them into some unwanted behavior is an entirely different matter.\"\\n\\n \"My friend is about to do something dangerous,\" I said. \"It could kill her. She\u0027s being compelled, but I can\u0027t do anything about it. The bond won\u0027t let me actively reach her. I can only watch. If you could reach inside my friend\u0027s head and compel her out of danger...\"\\n\\n Oksana shook her head. \"Supposing morals weren\u0027t an issue, I can\u0027t reach into someone who\u0027s not actually here-let alone someone I\u0027ve never met.\"\\n\\n I raked a hand through my hair, panic setting in. I wished Oksana knew how to walk dreams. That would at least give her the long-distance capability. All of these spirit powers seemed to be one off from each other, each having some additional nuance. Someone who could dream walk might be able to take the next step and visit someone awake.\\n\\n An even crazier idea came to me. This was a groundbreaking day. \"Oksana... you can reach into my mind, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she reaffirmed.\\n\\n \"If I... if I was in my bondmate\u0027s head at the time, could you reach into me and then reach into her mind? Could I, like, be the link between you guys?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never heard of anything like that,\" murmured Mark.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because we\u0027ve never had this many spirit users and shadow-kissed around before,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n Abe, understandably, looked completely lost.\\n\\n A shadow fell over Oksana\u0027s face. \"I don\u0027t know...\"\\n\\n \"Either it works or it doesn\u0027t,\" I said. \"If it doesn\u0027t, then there\u0027s no harm done. But if you can reach her through me... you can compel her.\" She started to speak, and I cut her off. \"I know, I know... you think it\u0027s wrong. But this other spirit user? She\u0027s the one who\u0027s wrong. All you have to do is compel Lissa out of danger. She\u0027s ready to jump out a window! Stop her now; then I\u0027ll get to her in another day or so and fix things.\"\\n\\n And by fix things, I meant ruin Avery\u0027s pretty face with a black eye.\\n\\n In my bizarre life, I\u0027d grown pretty used to people-especially adults-rejecting my outlandish ideas and proclamations. I\u0027d had a hell of a time convincing people that Victor had kidnapped Lissa and an equally hard time making the guardians believe the school was under attack. So when situations like this happened, part of me almost expected resistance. But the thing was, as stable as they were, Oksana and Mark had been fighting with spirit for most of their lives. Crazy was kind of par for the course for them, and after a moment, she didn\u0027t argue any further.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said. \"Give me your hands.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" asked Abe, still totally clueless. I took a small amount of satisfaction in seeing him out of his league for a change.\\n\\n Mark murmured something to Oksana in Russian and kissed her on the cheek. He was warning her to be careful, not condemning her for her choice. I knew he\u0027d want the same thing if she were in Lissa\u0027s place. The love that flashed between them was so deep and so strong that I nearly lost my resolve to do this. That kind of love reminded me of Dimitri, and if I allowed myself to think about him for even a moment more, I was going to relive last night...\\n\\n I clasped Oksana\u0027s hands, a knot of fear coiling in my stomach. I didn\u0027t like the idea of someone being in my head, even though that was a hypocritical sentiment for someone who was constantly traveling into her best friend\u0027s mind. Oksana gave me a small smile, though it was obvious she was as nervous as me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I hate doing this to people...\"\\n\\n And then I felt it, the same thing that had happened when Avery pushed me out. It was like the actual physical sensation of someone touching my brain. I gasped, looking into Oksana\u0027s eyes as waves of heat and cold ran through me. Oksana was in my head.\\n\\n \"Now go to your friend,\" she said.\\n\\n I did. I focused my thoughts into Lissa and found her still standing on the window\u0027s ledge. Better she was there than on the ground, but I still wanted her off and back in the room before something bad happened. That wasn\u0027t for me to do, however. I was the taxi, so to speak. Oksana was the one who had to literally talk Lissa off the ledge. Only I had no indication the other woman had come with me. When I\u0027d jumped to Lissa\u0027s mind, I\u0027d lost that sense of Oksana. No more tickling of the mind.\\n\\n Oksana? I thought. Are you there?\\n\\n There was no response-not from Oksana, at least. The answer came from a very unexpected source.\\n\\n Rose?\\n\\n It was Lissa\u0027s voice that spoke in my mind. She froze her position in the window and abruptly cut off whatever she\u0027d been laughing about with Avery. I felt Lissa\u0027s terror and confusion as she wondered if she was imagining me. She peered around the room, her eyes passing over Avery.\\n\\n Avery recognized something was going on, and her face hardened. I felt the familiar sense of her presence in Lissa\u0027s mind and wasn\u0027t surprised when Avery tried to shove me out again.\\n\\n Except-it didn\u0027t work.\\n\\n Avery kicking me out in the past had always felt like an actual shove. I got the impression that when she tried it now, it felt like hitting a brick wall to her. I wasn\u0027t so easy to push around anymore. Oksana was with me somehow, lending her strength. Avery was still in Lissa\u0027s line of sight, and I saw those adorable blue-gray eyes go wide with shock that she couldn\u0027t control me.\\n\\n Oh, I thought. It\u0027s on, bitch!\\n\\n Rose? Lissa\u0027s voice was there again. Am I going crazy?\\n\\n Not yet. But you have to get down, right now. I think Avery\u0027s trying to kill you.\\n\\n Kill me? I could feel and hear Lissa\u0027s incredulity. She\u0027d never do that.\\n\\n Look, let\u0027s not argue it for now. Just get out of the window and call it good.\\n\\n I felt the impulse in Lissa, felt her shift and start to put one foot down. Then it was like some core part of herself stopped her. Her foot stayed where it was... and slowly began to grow unsteady...\\n\\n That was Avery at work. I wondered if Oksana, lurking in the background of this bond, could overpower that compulsion. No, Oksana wasn\u0027t active here. Her spirit powers had somehow gotten me into actively communicating with Lissa, but she was remaining passive. I\u0027d expected to be the bridge and thought Oksana would jump to Lissa\u0027s mind and compel her. The situation was reversed, though, and I didn\u0027t actually have compulsion powers. All I had was legendary wit and powers of persuasion.\\n\\n Lissa, you have to fight Avery, I said. She\u0027s a spirit user, and she\u0027s compelling you. You\u0027re one of the strongest compulsion users I know. You should be able to fight her.\\n\\n Fear answered me. I can\u0027t... I can\u0027t compel right now.\\n\\n Why not?\\n\\n Because I\u0027ve been drinking.\\n\\n I mentally groaned. Of course. That was why Avery was always so quick to supply Lissa with alcohol. It numbed spirit, as demonstrated in Adrian\u0027s frequent indulgences. Avery had encouraged the drinking so that Lissa\u0027s spirit abilities would weaken and give her less resistance. There were a number of times Lissa hadn\u0027t been able to gauge exactly how much Avery was drinking; in retrospect, Avery must have been doing a fair amount of faking.\\n\\n Then use ordinary willpower, I told her. It\u0027s possible to resist compulsion.\\n\\n It was true. Compulsion wasn\u0027t an automatic ticket to world domination. Some people were better at resisting it than others, though a Strigoi or spirit user certainly complicated matters.\\n\\n I felt Lissa build up her resolve, felt her repeat my words over and over, that she had to be strong and step back off the ledge. She worked to push away that impulse Avery had implanted, and without knowing how, I suddenly found myself pushing on it as well. Lissa and I joined our strength together and started shoving Avery out.\\n\\n In the physical world, Avery and Lissa\u0027s gazes were locked as the psychic struggle continued. Avery\u0027s face showed hard concentration that suddenly became overlaid with shock. She\u0027d noticed me fighting her too. Her eyes narrowed, and when she spoke, it was me she addressed and not Lissa.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Avery hissed, \"you do not want to mess with me.\"\\n\\n Didn\u0027t I?\\n\\n There was a rush of heat and that feeling of someone reaching into my mind. Only it wasn\u0027t Oksana. It was Avery, and she was doing some serious investigation of my thoughts and memories. I understood now what Oksana meant about it being invasive and a violation. It wasn\u0027t just looking through someone\u0027s eyes; it was spying on their most intimate thoughts.\\n\\n And then, the world around me dissolved. I stood in a room I didn\u0027t recognize. For a moment, I thought I was back in Galina\u0027s estate. It certainly had that rich, expensive feel to it. But no. After a moment\u0027s examination, I realized this wasn\u0027t the same at all. The furnishings were different. Even the vibe was different. Galina\u0027s home had been beautiful, but there had been a cold, impersonal feel to it. This place was inviting and clearly well loved. The plush couch had a quilt thrown haphazardly in its corner, as though someone-or maybe two someones-had been cuddling underneath it. And while the room wasn\u0027t messy, exactly, there were scattered objects-books, framed photos-that indicated this room was actually used and wasn\u0027t just for show.\\n\\n I walked over to a small bookshelf and picked up one of the framed photos. I nearly dropped it when I saw what it was. It was a picture of Dimitri and me-but I had no memory of it. We stood arm in arm, leaning our faces together to make sure we both got in the shot. I was grinning broadly, and he too wore a joyous smile, one I\u0027d hardly ever seen on him. It softened some of the protective fierceness that usually filled his features and made him look sexier than I\u0027d ever imagined. A piece of that soft brown hair had slipped his ponytail and lay on his cheek. Beyond us was a city that I immediately recognized: Saint Petersburg. I frowned. No, this was definitely a picture that couldn\u0027t exist.\\n\\n I was still studying it when I heard someone walk into the room. When I saw who it was, my heart stopped. I set the photo back on the shelf with shaking hands and took a few steps back.\\n\\n It was Dimitri.\\n\\n He wore jeans and a casual red T-shirt that fit the lean muscles of his body perfectly. His hair was down loose and slightly damp, like he\u0027d just gotten out of the shower. He held two mugs and chuckled when he saw me.\\n\\n \"Still not dressed?\" he asked, shaking his head. \"They\u0027re going to be here any minute.\"\\n\\n I looked down and saw that I wore plaid flannel pajama bottoms and a tank top. He handed me the mug, and I was too stunned to do anything but take it. I peered into it-hot chocolate-and then looked up at him. There was no red in his eyes, no evil on his face. Only gorgeous warmth and affection. He was my Dimitri, the one who\u0027d loved and protected me. The one with a pure heart and soul...\\n\\n \"Who... who\u0027s coming?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Lissa and Christian. They\u0027re coming for brunch.\" He gave me a puzzled look. \"Are you okay?\"\\n\\n I looked around, again taking in the comforting room. Through a window, I saw a backyard filled with trees and flowers. Sunshine spilled through onto the carpet. I turned back to him and shook my head. \"What is this? Where are we?\"\\n\\n His confused expression now turned into a frown. Stepping forward, he took my mug and set his and mine on the shelf. His hands rested on my hips, and I flinched but didn\u0027t break away-how could I when he looked so much like my Dimitri? \"This is our house,\" he said, drawing me near. \"In Pennsylvania.\"\\n\\n \"Pennsylvania... are we at the\\n\\n Royal Court\\n\\n ?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"A few miles away.\"\\n\\n I slowly shook my head. \"No... that\u0027s not possible. We can\u0027t have a home together. And definitely not so close to the others. They\u0027d never let us.\"\\n\\n If in some crazy world Dimitri and I lived together, we\u0027d have to do it in secret-somewhere remote, like Siberia.\\n\\n \"You insisted,\" he said with a small smile. \"And none of them care. They accept it. Besides, you said we had to live near Lissa.\"\\n\\n My mind reeled. What was going on? How was this possible? How could I be living with Dimitri-especially so near Moroi? This wasn\u0027t right... and yet, it felt right. Looking around, I could see how this was my home. I could feel the love in it, feel the connection Dimitri and I had to it. But... how could I actually be with Dimitri? Wasn\u0027t I supposed to be doing something else? Wasn\u0027t I supposed to be somewhere else? \"You\u0027re a Strigoi,\" I said at last. \"No... you\u0027re dead. I killed you.\"\\n\\n He ran a finger along my cheek, still giving me that rueful smile. \"Do I look like I\u0027m dead? Do I look Strigoi?\"\\n\\n No. He looked wonderful and sexy and strong. He was all the things I remembered, all the things I loved. \"But you were...\" I trailed off, still confused. This wasn\u0027t right. There was something I had to do, but I still couldn\u0027t remember. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n His hand returned to my hip, and he pulled me into a tight embrace. \"You saved me,\" he murmured into my ear. \"Your love saved me, Roza. You brought me back so that we could be together.\"\\n\\n Had I? I had no memory of that, either. But this all seemed so real, and it felt so wonderful. I\u0027d missed his arms around me. He\u0027d held me as a Strigoi, but it had never felt like this. And when he leaned down and kissed me, I knew for sure he wasn\u0027t a Strigoi. I didn\u0027t know how I could have ever deluded myself back at Galina\u0027s. This kiss was alive. It burned within my soul, and as my lips pressed more eagerly into his, I felt that connection, the one that told me there was no one else in the world for me except him.\\n\\n Only, I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that I wasn\u0027t supposed to be here. But where was I supposed to be? Lissa... something with Lissa...\\n\\n I broke the kiss but not the embrace. My head rested against his chest. \"I really saved you?\"\\n\\n \"Your love was too strong. Our love was too strong. Not even the undead could keep us apart.\"\\n\\n I wanted to believe it. Desperately. But that voice still nagged in my head... Lissa. What about Lissa? Then, it came to me. Lissa and Avery. I had to save Lissa from Avery. I jerked away from Dimitri, and he stared in surprise.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t real,\" I said. \"This is a trick. You\u0027re still Strigoi. We can\u0027t be together-not here, not among the Moroi.\"\\n\\n \"Of course we can.\" There was hurt in his deep brown eyes, and it tore at my heart. \"Don\u0027t you want to be with me?\"\\n\\n \"I have to go back to Lissa...\"\\n\\n \"Let her go,\" he said, approaching me again. \"Let all of it go. Stay here with me-we can have everything we ever wanted, Rose. We can be together every day, wake up together every morning.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I stepped further back. I knew if I didn\u0027t, he would kiss me again, and then I\u0027d truly be lost. Lissa needed me. Lissa was trapped. With each passing second, the details about Avery were coming back to me. This was all an illusion.\\n\\n \"Rose?\" he asked. There was so much pain in his voice. \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, feeling on the verge of tears. Lissa. I had to get to Lissa. \"This isn\u0027t real. You\u0027re gone. You and I can never be together, but I can still help her.\"\\n\\n \"You love her more than me?\"\\n\\n Lissa had asked me almost the same thing when I\u0027d left to hunt Dimitri. My life was doomed to always be about choosing between them.\\n\\n \"I love you both,\" I replied.\\n\\n And with that, I used all of my will to push myself back to Lissa, wherever she was, and tear away from this fantasy. Honestly, I could have spent the rest of my days in that make-believe world, being with Dimitri in that house, waking up with him each morning like he\u0027d said. But it wasn\u0027t real.\\n\\n It was too easy, and if I was learning anything, it was that life wasn\u0027t easy.\\n\\n The effort was excruciating, but suddenly, I found myself looking back at the room at St. Vladimir\u0027s. I focused on Avery who was staring me and Lissa down. She\u0027d pulled out the memory that tormented me most, attempting to confuse me and tear me from Lissa with a fantasy of what I wanted more than anything else in the world. I\u0027d fought Avery\u0027s mind trap and felt pretty smug about it-despite the ache in my heart. I wished I could communicate directly with her and make a few comments about what I thought of her and her game. That was out of the question, so instead, I threw my will in with Lissa\u0027s once more, and together, we stepped down off the ledge and onto the room\u0027s floor.\\n\\n Avery was visibly sweating, and when she realized she\u0027d lost the psychic tug of war, her pretty face turned very ugly. \"Fine,\" she said. \"There are easier ways of killing you off.\"\\n\\n Reed suddenly entered the room, looking as hostile as ever. I had no idea where he\u0027d come from or how he\u0027d known to show up right then, but he headed straight toward Lissa, hands reaching out. That open window loomed behind her, and it didn\u0027t take a genius to guess his intentions. Avery had tried to get Lissa to jump by using compulsion. Reed was just going to push her.\\n\\n A mental conversation flew between Lissa and me in the space of a heartbeat.\\n\\n Okay, I told her. Here\u0027s the situation. We\u0027re going to have to do a little role reversal.\\n\\n What are you talking about? Fear flooded her, which was understandable, seeing as Reed\u0027s hands were seconds away from grabbing her.\\n\\n Well, I said, I just did the psychic power struggle. Which means you\u0027ve got to do the fighting. And I\u0027m going to show you how. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-28.html","bookId":2063,"book":{"id":2063,"title":"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy #4)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 4: Blood Promise \\n The heart of the story focuses on the hero Rose Hathaway\u0027s journey to fulfill the promise she made to herself and Dimitri. During this journey, Rose finds herself in situations she would never have imagined--mob-like characters whose intentions are ambiguous, other aspects of Moroi life she was not privvy to, along with her first encounter with a dhampir commune, meeting other dhampirs with a vendetta like her, and finally, her heart stopping confrontation with Dimitri. No spoilers will be given, for that would take away at the amazing story Mead has created, but rest assured, you have seen absolutely nothing yet. \\n The novel was a mind-blowing experience full of amazing adventures and action that showed no signs of letting up at any point during the reading.
