{"id":110819,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"The next day was Easter. Everyone was up and around, getting ready to go to church. The whole house smelled delicious, filled with the scents of Olena\u0027s baking. My stomach rumbled, and I wondered if I could wait until this afternoon for the huge dinner she\u0027d prepared. Even though I wasn\u0027t always sure about God, I\u0027d gone to church a lot in my life. Mostly, it was a courtesy to others, a way of being polite and social. Dimitri had gone because he found peace there, and I wondered if going today might offer me some insight on what I should do.\n I felt a little shabby accompanying the others. They\u0027d dressed up, but I didn\u0027t have anything other than jeans and casual shirts. Viktoria, noticing my dismay, lent me a lacy white blouse that was a little tight but still looked good. Once I was settled with the family into a pew, I looked around, wondering how Dimitri could have taken solace in the Academy\u0027s tiny chapel when he\u0027d grown up with this place.\n It was huge. It could have held four chapels. The ceilings were higher and more elaborate, and gold decorations and icons of saints seemed to cover every surface. It was overwhelming, dazzling to the eye. Sweet incense hung heavy in the air, so much so that I could actually see the smoke.\n There were a lot of people there, human and dhampir, and I was surprised to even spot some Moroi. Apparently, the Moroi visiting town were pious enough to come to church, despite whatever sordid activities they might be engaging in. And speaking of Moroi...\n \"Abe isn\u0027t here,\" I said to Viktoria, glancing around. She was on my left; Olena sat on my right. While he hadn\u0027t struck me as the religious type, I\u0027d kind of expected him to follow me here. I hoped that maybe his absence meant he\u0027d left Baia. I was still unnerved by our last encounter. \"Did he leave town?\"\n \"I think he\u0027s Muslim,\" Viktoria explained. \"But last I knew, he\u0027s still around. Karolina saw him this morning.\"\n Damn Zmey. He hadn\u0027t left. What was it he\u0027d said? A good friend or a bad enemy.\n When I said nothing, Viktoria gave me a concerned look. \"He\u0027s never really done anything bad when he\u0027s around. He usually has meetings and then disappears. I meant it before when I said I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d hurt you, but now you\u0027re worrying me. Are you in some kind of trouble?\"\n Excellent question. \"I don\u0027t know. He just seems interested in me, that\u0027s all. I can\u0027t figure out why.\"\n Her frown deepened. \"We won\u0027t let anything happen to you,\" she said fiercely.\n I smiled, both at her concern and because of her resemblance to Dimitri in that moment. \"Thanks. There are some people back home who might be looking for me, and I think that Abe is just... checking up on me.\" That was a nice way of describing someone who was either going to drag me back to the U.S. kicking and screaming-or just make me vanish for good.\n Viktoria seemed to sense I was softening the truth. \"Well, I mean it. I won\u0027t let him hurt you.\"\n The service started, cutting off our conversation. While the priest\u0027s chanting was beautiful, it meant even less to me than church services usually did. It was all in Russian, like at the funeral, and no one was going to bother translating it for me today. It didn\u0027t matter. Still taking in the beauty of my surroundings, I found my mind wandering. To the left of the altar, a golden-haired angel looked at me from a four-foot-tall icon.\n An unexpected memory came to me. Dimitri had once gotten permission for me to accompany him on a quick weekend trip to Idaho to meet with some other guardians. Idaho wasn\u0027t any place I was keen on going, but I welcomed the time with him, and he\u0027d convinced school officials that it was a \"learning experience.\" That had been shortly after Mason\u0027s death, and after the shock wave that tragedy had sent through the school, I think they would have allowed me anything, to be honest.\n Unfortunately, there was little that was leisurely or romantic about the trip. Dimitri had a job to do, and he had to do it quickly. So we made the best time we could, stopping only when absolutely necessary. Considering our last road trip had involved us stumbling onto a Moroi massacre, this one being uneventful was probably for the best. As usual, he wouldn\u0027t let me drive, despite my claims that I could get us there in half the time. Or maybe that was why he wouldn\u0027t let me drive.\n We stopped at one point to get gas and scrounge some food from the station\u0027s store. We were up in the mountains somewhere, in a tiny town that rivaled St. Vladimir\u0027s for remote location. I could see mountains on clear days at school, but it was a totally different experience being in them.\n They surrounded us and were so close it seemed like you could just jump over and land on one. Dimitri was finishing up with the car. Holding my sub sandwich, I walked around to the back of the gas station to get a better view.\n Whatever civilization the gas station offered disappeared as soon as I cleared it. Endless snowy pines stretched out before me, and all was still and quiet, save for the distant sound of the highway behind me. My heart ached over what had happened to Mason, and I was still having nightmares about the Strigoi who\u0027d held us captive. That pain was a long way from disappearing, but something about this peaceful setting soothed me for a moment.\n Looking down at the unbroken, foot-high snow, a crazy thought suddenly came to me. I let myself go, falling back-first to the ground. The thick snow embraced me, and I rested there a moment, taking comfort in lying down. Then I moved my legs and arms back and forth, carving out new hollows in the snow. When I finished, I didn\u0027t get up right away. I simply continued lounging, staring up at the blue, blue sky.\n \"What,\" asked Dimitri, \"are you doing? Aside from getting your sandwich cold.\"\n His shadow fell over me, and I looked up at his tall form. In spite of the cold, the sun was out, and its rays backlit his hair. He could have been an angel himself, I thought.\n \"I\u0027m making a snow angel,\" I replied. \"Don\u0027t you know what that is?\"\n \"Yes, I know. But why? You must be freezing.\"\n I had on a heavy winter coat, hat, gloves, and all the other requisite cold-weather accessories. He was right about the sandwich. \"Not so much, actually. My face is a little, I guess.\"\n He shook his head and gave me a wry smile. \"You\u0027ll be cold when you\u0027re in the car and all that snow starts melting.\"\n \"I think you\u0027re more worried about the car than about me.\"\n He laughed. \"I\u0027m more worried about you getting hypothermia.\"\n \"In this? This is nothing.\" I patted the ground beside me. \"Come on. You make one too, and then we can go.\"\n He continued looking down at me. \"So I can freeze too?\"\n \"So you can have fun. So you can leave your mark on Idaho. Besides, it shouldn\u0027t bother you at all, right? Don\u0027t you have some sort of super cold resistance from Siberia?\"\n He sighed, a smile still on his lips. It was enough to warm me even in this weather. \"There you go again, convinced Siberia is like Antarctica. I\u0027m from the southern part. The weather\u0027s almost the same as here.\"\n \"You\u0027re making excuses,\" I told him. \"Unless you want to drag me back to the car, you\u0027re going to have to make an angel too.\"\n Dimitri studied me for several heavy moments, and I thought he might actually haul me away. His face was still light and open, though, and his expression was filled with a fondness that made my heart race. Then, without warning, he flopped into the snow beside me, lying there quietly.\n \"Okay,\" I said when he did nothing more. \"Now you have to move your arms and legs.\"\n \"I know how to make a snow angel.\"\n \"Then do it! Otherwise, you\u0027re more like a chalk outline at a police crime scene.\"\n He laughed again, and the sound was rich and warm in the still air. Finally, after a little more coaxing on my part, he moved his arms and legs too, making an angel of his own. When he finished, I expected him to jump up and demand we get back on the road, but instead, he stayed there too, watching the sky and the mountains.\n \"Pretty, huh?\" I asked. My breath made frosty clouds in the air. \"I guess in some ways, it\u0027s not that different from the ski resort\u0027s view... but I don\u0027t know. I feel different about it all today.\"\n \"Life\u0027s like that,\" he said. \"As we grow and change, sometimes things we\u0027ve experienced before take on new meaning. It\u0027ll happen for the rest of your life.\"\n I started to tease him about his tendency to always deliver these profound life lessons, but it occurred to me then that he was right. When I\u0027d first begun falling for Dimitri, the feelings had been all-consuming. I\u0027d never felt anything like it before. I\u0027d been convinced there was no possible way I could love him more. But now, after what I\u0027d witnessed with Mason and the Strigoi, things were different. I did love Dimitri more intensely. I loved him in a different way, in a deeper way. Something about seeing how fragile life was made me appreciate him more. It had made me realize how much he meant to me and how sad I\u0027d be if I ever lost him.\n \"You think it\u0027d be nice to have a cabin up there?\" I asked, pointing to a nearby peak. \"Out in the woods where no one could find you?\"\n \"I would think it was nice. I think you\u0027d be bored.\"\n I tried to imagine being stuck in the wilderness with him. Small room, fireplace, bed... I didn\u0027t think it\u0027d be that boring. \"It wouldn\u0027t be so bad if we had cable. And Internet.\" And body heat.\n \"Oh, Rose.\" He didn\u0027t laugh, but I could tell he was smiling again. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027d ever be happy someplace quiet. You always need something to do.\"\n \"Are you saying I have a short attention span?\"\n \"Not at all. I\u0027m saying there\u0027s a fire in you that drives everything you do, that makes you need to better the world and those you love. To stand up for those you can\u0027t. It\u0027s one of the wonderful things about you.\"\n \"Only one, huh?\" I spoke lightly, but his words had thrilled me. He\u0027d meant what he said about thinking those were wonderful traits, and feeling his pride in me meant more than anything just then.\n \"One of many,\" he said. He sat up and looked down at me. \"So, no peaceful cabin for you. Not until you\u0027re an old, old woman.\"\n \"What, like forty?\"\n He shook his head in exasperation and stood up, not gracing my joke with a response. Still, he regarded me with the same affection I\u0027d heard in his voice. There was admiration too, and I thought I could never be unhappy as long as Dimitri thought I was wonderful and beautiful. Leaning down, he extended his hand. \"Time to go.\"\n I took it, letting him help pull me up. Once standing, we held hands for a heartbeat longer than necessary. Then we let go and surveyed our work.\n Two perfect snow angels-one much, much taller than the other. Careful to step inside each outline, I leaned down and hacked out a horizontal line above each head.\n \"What\u0027s that?\" he asked, when I stood beside him again.\n \"Halos,\" I said with a grin. \"For heavenly creatures like us.\"\n \"That might be a stretch.\"\n We studied our angels for a few moments more, looking at where we had lain side by side in that sweet, quiet moment. I wished what I\u0027d said was true, that we had truly left our mark on the mountain. But I knew that after the next snowfall, our angels would disappear into the whiteness and be nothing more than a memory.\n Dimitri touched my arm gently, and without another word, we turned around and headed back to the car.\n Compared to that memory of him and the way he\u0027d looked at me out there on the mountain, I thought the angel looking back at me in church seemed pale and boring in comparison. No offense to her.\n The congregation was filing back to their seats after taking bread and wine. I\u0027d stayed seated for that, but I did understand a few of the priest\u0027s words. Life. Death. Destroy. Eternal. I knew enough about all this to string together the meaning. I would have bet good money \"resurrection\" was in there too. I sighed, wishing it were truly that easy to vanquish death and bring back those we loved.\n Church ended, and I left with the Belikovs, feeling melancholy. As people passed each other near the entrance, I saw some eggs being exchanged.\n Viktoria had explained that it was a big tradition around here. A few people I didn\u0027t know gave some to me, and I felt a little bad that I had nothing to give in return. I also wondered how I was going to eat them all. They were decorated in various ways. Some were simply colored; others were elaborately designed.\n Everyone seemed chatty after church, and we all stood around outside it. Friends and family hugged and caught up on gossip. I stood near Viktoria, smiling and trying to follow the conversation that often took place in both English and Russian.\n \"Viktoria!\"\n We turned and saw Nikolai striding toward us. He gave us-by which I mean, he gave her-a brilliant smile. He\u0027d dressed up for the holiday and looked amazing in a sage shirt and dark green tie. I eyed Viktoria, wondering if it had any effect on her. Nope. Her smile was polite, genuinely happy to see him, but there was nothing romantic there. Again, I wondered about her mystery \"friend.\"\n He had a couple of guys with him whom I\u0027d met before. They greeted me too. Like the Belikovs, they seemed to think I was a permanent fixture around here.\n \"Are you still going to Marina\u0027s party?\" asked Nikolai.\n I\u0027d nearly forgotten. That was the party he\u0027d invited us to the first day I\u0027d met him. Viktoria had accepted then, but to my surprise, she now shook her head. \"We can\u0027t. We have family plans.\"\n That was news to me. There was a possibility something had come up that I didn\u0027t know about yet, but I doubted it. I had a feeling she was lying, and being a loyal friend, I said nothing to contradict her. It was hard watching Nikolai\u0027s face fall, though.\n \"Really? We\u0027re going to miss you.\"\n She shrugged. \"We\u0027ll all see each other at school.\"\n He didn\u0027t seem pacified by that. \"Yeah, but-\"\n Nikolai\u0027s eyes suddenly lifted from her face and focused on something behind us. He frowned. Viktoria and I both glanced back, and I felt her mood shift too.\n Three guys were strolling toward my group. They were dhampirs as well. I didn\u0027t notice anything unusual about them-smirks aside-but other dhampirs and Moroi gathered outside the church took on expressions similar to those of my companions. Troubled. Worried. Uncomfortable. The three guys came to a stop by us, pushing their way into our circle.\n \"I thought you might be here, Kolya,\" said one. He spoke in perfect English, and it took me a moment to realize he was talking to Nikolai. I would never understand Russian nicknames.\n \"I didn\u0027t know you were back,\" replied Nikolai stiffly. Studying the two of them, I could see a distinct resemblance. They had the same bronze hair and lean build. Brothers, apparently.\n Nikolai\u0027s brother\u0027s gaze fell on me. He brightened. \"And you must be the unpromised American girl.\" It didn\u0027t surprise me that he knew who I was.\n After the memorial, most of the local dhampirs had left telling tales about the American girl who had fought battles against Strigoi but carried neither a promise mark nor a graduation mark.\n \"I\u0027m Rose,\" I said. I didn\u0027t know what was up with these guys, but I certainly wasn\u0027t going to show any fear in front of them. The guy seemed to appreciate my confidence and shook my hand.\n \"I\u0027m Denis.\" He gestured to his friends. \"Artur and Lev.\"\n \"When did you come to town?\" asked Nikolai, still not looking happy about this reunion.\n \"Just this morning.\" Denis turned to Viktoria. \"I heard about your brother. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Viktoria\u0027s expression was hard, but she nodded politely. \"Thank you.\"\n \"Is it true he fell defending Moroi?\"\n I didn\u0027t like the sneer in Denis\u0027s voice, but it was Karolina who voiced my angry thoughts. I hadn\u0027t noticed her approaching our group. She didn\u0027t look happy to see Denis at all.\n \"He fell fighting Strigoi. He died a hero.\"\n Denis shrugged, unaffected by the angry tone of her voice. \"Still makes him dead. I\u0027m sure the Moroi will sing his name for years to come.\"\n \"They will,\" I replied. \"He saved a whole group of them. And dhampirs too.\"\n Denis\u0027s gaze fell back on me, his eyes thoughtful as he studied my face for a few seconds. \"I heard you were there too. That both of you were sent into an impossible battle.\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t impossible. We won.\"\n \"Would Dimitri say that if he were alive?\"\n Karolina crossed her arms over her chest. \"If you\u0027re only here to start something, then you should leave. This is a church.\" It was funny. Upon meeting her, I\u0027d thought she seemed so gentle and kind, just an ordinary young mother working to support her family. But in this moment, she seemed more like Dimitri than ever. I could see that same strength within her, that fierceness that drove her to protect loved ones and stand up to her enemies. Not that these guys were her enemies, exactly. I honestly didn\u0027t yet understand who they were.\n \"We\u0027re just talking,\" said Denis. \"I just want to understand what happened to your brother. Believe me, I think his death was a tragedy.\"\n \"He wouldn\u0027t have regretted it,\" I told them. \"He died fighting for what he believed in.\"\n \"Defending others who took him for granted.\"\n \"That\u0027s not true.\"\n \"Oh?\" Denis gave me a lopsided smile. \"Then why don\u0027t you work for the guardians? You\u0027ve killed Strigoi but have no promise mark. Not even a graduation mark, I heard. Why aren\u0027t you out there throwing yourself in front of Moroi?\"\n \"Denis,\" said Nikolai uneasily, \"please just leave.\"\n \"I\u0027m not talking to you, Kolya.\" Denis\u0027s eyes were still on me. \"I\u0027m just trying to figure Rose out. She kills Strigoi but doesn\u0027t work for the guardians.\n She\u0027s clearly not like the rest of you soft people in this town. Maybe she\u0027s more like us.\"\n \"She\u0027s nothing like you,\" Viktoria snapped back.\n I got it then, and a chill ran down my spine. These were the kind of dhampirs that Mark had been talking about. The true unpromised ones. The vigilantes who sought out Strigoi on their own, the ones who neither settled down nor answered to any guardians. They shouldn\u0027t have unnerved me, not really. In some ways, Denis was right. In the simplest terms, I really was like them. And yet... there was an air about these guys that just rubbed me the wrong way.\n \"Then why are you in Russia?\" asked one of Denis\u0027s friends. I already couldn\u0027t remember his name. \"This is a long trip for you. You wouldn\u0027t have come here without a good reason.\"\n Viktoria was picking up her sister\u0027s anger. \"She came to tell us about Dimka.\"\n Denis eyed me. \"I think she\u0027s here to hunt Strigoi. There are more in Russia to choose from than there are in the States.\"\n \"She wouldn\u0027t be in Baia if she was hunting Strigoi, you idiot,\" returned Viktoria evenly. \"She\u0027d be in Vladivostok or Novosibirsk or somewhere like that.\"\n Novosibirsk. The name was familiar. But where had I heard it? A moment later, the answer came to me. Sydney had mentioned it. Novosibirsk was the largest city in Siberia.\n Denis continued. \"Maybe she\u0027s just passing through. Maybe she\u0027ll want to join us when we go to Novosibirsk tomorrow.\"\n \"For God\u0027s sake,\" I exclaimed. \"I\u0027m right here. Stop talking about me like I\u0027m not. And why would I want to go with you?\"\n Denis\u0027s eyes gleamed with an intense, feverish light. \"Good hunting there. Lots of Strigoi. Come with us, and you can help us go after them.\"\n \"And how many of you will come back from this?\" Karolina asked in a hard voice. \"Where\u0027s Timosha? Where\u0027s Vasiliy? Your hunting party keeps getting smaller each time you return here. Which one of you will be next? Whose family will be the next to mourn?\"\n \"Easy for you to talk,\" retorted the friend. Lev, I think his name was. \"You stay here and do nothing while we go out and keep you safe.\"\n Karolina gave him a disgusted look, and I recalled how she was dating a guardian. \"You go out and rush into situations without thinking. If you want to keep us safe, then stay here and defend your families when they need it. If you want to go after Strigoi, go join the guardians and work with those who have some sense.\"\n \"The guardians don\u0027t hunt Strigoi!\" cried Denis. \"They sit and wait and cower before the Moroi.\"\n The unfortunate part was, he had a point. But not entirely.\n \"That\u0027s changing,\" I said. \"There\u0027s a movement to start taking the offensive against the Strigoi. There\u0027s also talk of the Moroi learning to fight with us. You could help be a part of that.\"\n \"Like you are?\" he laughed. \"You still haven\u0027t told us why you\u0027re here and not with them. You can say what you want to the rest of this group, but I know why you\u0027re here. I can see it in you.\" The crazy, eerie look he gave me almost made me think that he could. \"You know the only way to rid the world of evil is to do it on our own. To seek out the Strigoi ourselves and kill them, one by one.\"\n \"Without a plan,\" finished Karolina. \"Without any thought of the consequences.\"\n \"We\u0027re strong and we know how to fight. That\u0027s all we need to know when it comes to killing Strigoi.\"\n And that was when I understood. I finally got what Mark had been trying to tell me. Denis was saying exactly what I had been thinking since I left St. Vladimir\u0027s. I\u0027d run off without a plan, wanting to throw myself into danger because I felt I had a mission that only I could carry out. Only I could kill Dimitri. Only I could destroy the evil within him. I\u0027d been giving no thought to how I\u0027d pull it off-seeing as Dimitri had beat me more often than not in fights when he was still a dhampir. With a Strigoi\u0027s strength and speed now? The odds were definitely against me. Still, I hadn\u0027t cared. I\u0027d been obsessed, convinced I had to do this.\n In my own head, what I had to do made sense, but now... hearing those sentiments from Denis, it sounded crazy. Just as reckless as Mark had warned. Their motives might be good-just as mine were-but they were also suicidal. Without Dimitri, I honestly hadn\u0027t cared much about my own life. I\u0027d never been afraid to risk it before, but now I realized there was a big difference between dying uselessly and dying for a reason. If I died trying to kill Dimitri because I had no strategy, then my life would have meant nothing.\n Just then, the priest walked over and said something to us in Russian. From his tone and expression, I think he was asking if everything was okay.\n He\u0027d mingled with the rest of the congregation after the service. Being human, he probably didn\u0027t know all the dhampir politics afoot, but he could undoubtedly sense trouble.\n Denis offered him a simpering smile and gave what sounded like a polite explanation. The priest smiled in return, nodded, and wandered off when someone else called to him.\n \"Enough,\" said Karolina harshly, once the priest was out of earshot. \"You need to go. Now.\"\n Denis\u0027s body tensed, and mine responded, ready for a fight. I thought he might start something then and there. A few seconds later, he relaxed and turned to me.\n \"Show them to me first.\"\n \"Show you what?\" I asked.\n \"The marks. Show me how many Strigoi you\u0027ve killed.\"\n I didn\u0027t respond right away, wondering if this was a trick. Everyone\u0027s eyes were on me. Turning slightly, I lifted the hair off the back of my neck and showed my tattoos. Little lightning-shaped molnija marks were there, along with the mark I\u0027d gotten for the battle. From the sound of Denis\u0027s gasp, I was guessing he\u0027d never seen that many kills before. I let my hair go and met his gaze levelly.\n \"Anything else?\" I asked.\n \"You\u0027re wasting your time,\" he said at last, gesturing to the people behind me. \"With them. With this place. You should come with us to Novosibirsk. We\u0027ll help make your life worthwhile.\"\n \"I\u0027m the only one who can make anything of my life.\" I pointed down the street. \"You were asked to leave. Now go.\"\n I held my breath, still bracing for a fight. After several tense moments, the group retreated. Before turning around, Denis gave me one last piercing look.\n \"This isn\u0027t what you want and you know it. When you change your mind, come find us at 83 Kasakova. We leave at sunrise tomorrow.\"\n \"You\u0027ll be leaving without me,\" I said.\n Denis\u0027 smile sent another chill down my spine. \"We\u0027ll see.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4/page-14.html","bookId":2063,"book":{"id":2063,"title":"Blood Promise (Vampire Academy #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 4: Blood Promise \n The heart of the story focuses on the hero Rose Hathaway\u0027s journey to fulfill the promise she made to herself and Dimitri.
