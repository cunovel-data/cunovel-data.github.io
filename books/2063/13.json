{"id":110818,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Being with Lissa left me with more questions than answers, and so without a course of action, I simply continued to stay with the Belikovs for the next few days. I fell into their normal routine, again surprised by how easy it was. I tried hard to make myself useful, doing any chores they\u0027d let me do and even going so far as watching the baby (something I wasn\u0027t entirely comfortable with, seeing as guardian training hadn\u0027t left much time for after school jobs like babysitting). Yeva eyed me the whole time, never saying anything but always looking like she disapproved. I wasn\u0027t sure if she wanted me to go or if that was simply the way she always looked. The others, however, didn\u0027t question me at all. They were delighted to have me around and made it obvious in every action. Viktoria was especially happy.\\n\\n \"I wish you could come back to school with us,\" Viktoria said wistfully one evening. She and I had been spending a lot of time together.\\n\\n \"When do you go back?\"\\n\\n \"Monday, right after Easter.\"\\n\\n I felt a little sadness stir in me. Whether I was still here or not, I would miss her. \"Oh, man. I didn\u0027t realize it was so soon.\"\\n\\n A small silence fell between us; then she gave me a sidelong look. \"Have you thought... well, have you maybe thought about coming back to St. Basil\u0027s with us?\"\\n\\n I stared. \"St. Basil\u0027s? Your school is named after a saint too?\" Not all of them were. Adrian had attended an East Coast school called Alder.\\n\\n \"Ours is a human saint,\" she said with a grin. \"You could enroll there. You could finish your last year-I\u0027m sure they\u0027d take you.\"\\n\\n Of all the crazy options I\u0027d considered on this trip-and believe me, I\u0027d considered a lot of crazy things-that was one that had never crossed my mind. I\u0027d written school off. I was pretty sure there was nothing else I could learn-well, after meeting Sydney and Mark, it had become obvious there were still a few more things. Considering what I wanted to do with my life, however, I didn\u0027t think another semester of math and science would do much for me. And as far as guardian training went, mostly all I had left to do w s prepare for the end-of-year trials. I somehow doubted those tests and challenges would even come remotely close to what I\u0027d experienced with Strigoi already.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think so. I think I\u0027m pretty much done with school. Besides, it\u0027d all be in Russian.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027d translate for you.\" A mischievous grin lit her face. \"Besides, kicking and punching transcend language.\" Her smile faded to a more thoughtful expression. \"But seriously. If you aren\u0027t going to finish school, and you aren\u0027t going to be a guardian... well, why don\u0027t you stay here? I mean, just in Baia. You could live with us.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to be a blood whore,\" I said immediately.\\n\\n An odd look crossed her face. \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\"\\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t have said that. Sorry.\" I felt bad about the comment. While I kept hearing rumors about blood whores in town, I\u0027d only seen one or two, and certainly the Belikov women weren\u0027t among them. Sonya\u0027s pregnancy was something of a mystery, but working in a drugstore didn\u0027t seem that sordid. I\u0027d learned a little bit more about Karolina\u0027s situation. The father of her children was a Moroi she apparently had a genuine connection with. She hadn\u0027t cheapened herself to be with him, and he hadn\u0027t used her. After the baby was born, the two of them had decided to part ways, but it had been friendly. Karolina was now apparently dating a guardian who visited whenever he had leave.\\n\\n The few blood whores I had seen around town very much fit my stereotype. Their clothing and makeup screamed easy sex. The bruises on their necks clearly showed that they had no problem with letting their partners drink blood during sex, which was pretty much the sleaziest thing a dhampir could do. Only humans gave blood to Moroi. My race didn\u0027t. To allow it-particularly during sexual activities-well, like I said, it was sleazy.\\n\\n The dirtiest of the dirty.\\n\\n \"Mother would love it if you stayed. You could get a job too. Just be part of our family.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t take Dimitri\u0027s place, Viktoria,\" I said softly.\\n\\n She reached out and gave my hand a reassuring squeeze. \"I know. No one expects you to. We like you for you, Rose. You being here just feels right-there\u0027s a reason Dimka chose to be with you. You fit in here.\"\\n\\n I tried to imagine the life she described. It sounded... easy. Comfortable. No worries. Just living with a loving family, laughing and hanging out together each night. I could go about my own life, not having to trail someone else all day. I would have sisters. There\u0027d be no fighting-unless it was to defend. I could give up this plan to kill Dimitri-which I knew would kill me too, either physically or spiritually. I could choose the rational path, let him go and accept him as dead. And, yet... if I did that, why not just go back to Montana? Back to Lissa and the Academy? \"I don\u0027t know,\" I told Viktoria at last. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m going to do.\"\\n\\n It was just after dinner, and she glanced hesitantly at the clock. \"I don\u0027t want to leave you since we don\u0027t have much time together, but... I was supposed to meet someone soon...\"\\n\\n \"Nikolai?\" I teased.\\n\\n She shook her head, and I tried to hide my disappointment. I\u0027d seen him a few times, and he\u0027d grown more and more likeable. It was too bad Viktoria couldn\u0027t kindle any feelings for him. Now, though, I wondered if there might be something holding her back-or rather, someone.\\n\\n \"Oh, spill,\" I said with a grin. \"Who is he?\"\\n\\n She kept her face blank in a fair imitation of Dimitri\u0027s. \"A friend,\" she said evasively. But I thought I saw a smile in her eyes.\\n\\n \"Someone at school?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" She sighed. \"And that\u0027s the problem. I\u0027m going to miss him so much.\"\\n\\n My smile faded. \"I can imagine.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She looked embarrassed. \"That\u0027s stupid of me. My problems... well, they\u0027re nothing compared to yours. I mean, I may not see him for a while... but I will see him. But Dimitri\u0027s gone. You won\u0027t see him ever again.\"\\n\\n Well, that might not be entirely true. I didn\u0027t tell her that, though. Instead, I just said, \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n To my surprise, she gave me a hug. \"I know what love\u0027s like. To lose that... I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t know what to say. All I can tell you is that we\u0027re here for you. All of us, okay? You can\u0027t replace Dimitri, but you do feel like a sister.\"\\n\\n Her calling me a sister both stunned and warmed me at the same time. She had to go get ready for her date after that. She hurriedly changed clothes and put on makeup-definitely more than a friend, I decided-and headed out the door. I was kind of glad because I didn\u0027t want her to see the tears that her words had brought to my eyes. I\u0027d spent my life as an only child. Lissa had been the closest I had to a sister. I\u0027d always thought of Lissa as one; one I\u0027d now lost. To hear Viktoria call me a sister now... well, it stirred something in me. Something that told me I really did have friends and wasn\u0027t alone.\\n\\n I headed down to the kitchen after that, and Olena soon joined me. I was rummaging for food.\\n\\n \"Was that Viktoria I heard leave?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah, she went off to see a friend.\" To my credit, I kept my expression neutral. No way would I sell Viktoria out.\\n\\n Olena sighed. \"I\u0027d wanted her to run an errand for me in town.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do it,\" I said eagerly. \"After I grab something to eat.\"\\n\\n She gave me a kind smile and patted my cheek. \"You have a good heart, Rose. I can see why Dimka loved you.\"\\n\\n It was so amazing, I thought, how accepted my relationship with Dimitri was around here. No one brought up age or teacher-student relationships.\\n\\n As I\u0027d told Sydney, it was like I was his widow or something, and Viktoria\u0027s words about me staying replayed in my head. The way Olena looked at me made me feel like I really was her daughter, and once more, I experienced those traitorous feelings about my own mom. She probably would have scoffed at me and Dimitri. She would have called it inappropriate and said I was too young. Or would she have? Maybe I was being too harsh.\\n\\n Seeing me in front of the open cupboard, Olena shook her head reproachfully. \"But you need to eat first.\"\\n\\n \"Just a snack,\" I assured her. \"Don\u0027t go to any trouble.\"\\n\\n She ended up slicing me off big pieces of black bread she\u0027d baked earlier that day and put out a tub of butter because she knew I loved to slather up my slices. Karolina had teased me that Americans might be shocked to know what was in this bread, so I never asked any questions. It was somehow sweet and tangy at the same time, and I loved it.\\n\\n Olena sat down across from me and watched me eat. \"This was his favorite when he was little.\"\\n\\n \"Dimitri\u0027s?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Whenever he was on break from school, the first thing he\u0027d do is ask for that bread. I practically had to make him his own loaf each time with the way he ate. The girls never ate that much.\"\\n\\n \"Guys always seem to eat more.\" Admittedly, I could keep up with most of them. \"And he\u0027s bigger and taller than most.\"\\n\\n \"True,\" she mused. \"But I eventually reached a point where I made him start making it himself. I told him if he was going to eat all my food, he\u0027d best know how much work went into it.\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"I can\u0027t imagine Dimitri baking bread.\"\\n\\n And yet, as soon as the words came out, I reconsidered. My immediate associations with Dimitri were always intense and fierce; it was his sexy, battle-god persona that came to mind. Yet, it had been Dimitri\u0027s gentleness and thoughtfulness mixed with that deadliness that made him so wonderful. The same hands that wielded stakes with such precision would carefully brush the hair out of my face. The eyes that could astutely spot any danger in the area would regard me wonderingly and worshipfully, like I was the most beautiful and amazing woman in the world.\\n\\n I sighed, consumed by that bittersweet ache in my chest that had become so familiar now. What a stupid thing, getting worked up over a loaf of bread of all things. But that was how it was. I got emotional whenever I thought about Dimitri.\\n\\n Olena\u0027s eyes were on me, sweet and compassionate. \"I know,\" she said, guessing my thoughts. \"I know exactly how you feel.\"\\n\\n \"Does it get easier?\" I asked.\\n\\n Unlike Sydney, Olena had an answer. \"Yes. But you\u0027ll never be the same.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know whether to take comfort from those words or not. After I finished eating, she gave me a brief grocery list, and I set off toward downtown, happy to be outside and moving. Inactivity didn\u0027t suit me.\\n\\n While in the grocery store, I was surprised to run into Mark. I\u0027d gotten the impression he and Oksana didn\u0027t come to town that often. I wouldn\u0027t have put it past them to grow their own food and live off the land. He gave me a warm smile. \"I wondered if you were still around.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" I held up my basket. \"Just doing some shopping for Olena.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re still here,\" he said. \"You seem more... at peace.\"\\n\\n \"Your ring is helping, I think. At least with the peace. It hasn\u0027t done much as far as any decision making goes.\"\\n\\n He frowned, shifting the milk he held in one arm to the other. \"What decisions?\"\\n\\n \"What to do now. Where to go.\"\\n\\n \"Why not stay here?\"\\n\\n It was eerie, so similar to the conversation I\u0027d had with Viktoria. And my response was equally similar. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do if I stayed here.\"\\n\\n \"Get a job. Live with the Belikovs. They love you, you know. You fit right in with their family.\"\\n\\n That warm, loved feeling came back, and I again tried to imagine myself just settling down with them, working in a store like this or waiting tables.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. I was a broken record. \"I just don\u0027t know if that\u0027s right for me.\"\\n\\n \"Better than the alternative,\" he warned. \"Better than running off with no real purpose, throwing yourself in the face of danger. That\u0027s no choice at all.\"\\n\\n And yet, it was the reason I\u0027d come to Siberia in the first place. My inner voice scolded me. Dimitri, Rose. Have you forgotten Dimitri? Have you forgotten how you came here to free him, like he would have wanted? Or was that really what he would have wanted? Maybe he would have wanted me to stay safe. I just didn\u0027t know, and with no more help from Mason, my choices were even more muddled. Thinking of Mason suddenly reminded me of something I\u0027d totally forgotten.\\n\\n \"When we talked before... well, we talked about what Lissa and Oksana could do. But what about you?\"\\n\\n Mark narrowed his eyes. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Have you ever... have you ever run into, um, ghosts?\"\\n\\n Several moments passed, and then he exhaled. \"I\u0027d hoped that wouldn\u0027t happen to you.\"\\n\\n It astonished me then how much relief I felt to know I wasn\u0027t alone in my ghostly experiences. Even though I now understood that having died and been to the world of the dead made me a target for spirits, it was still one of the freakiest things about being shadow-kissed.\\n\\n \"Did it happen without you wanting it?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"At first. Then I learned to control it.\"\\n\\n \"Me too.\" I suddenly recalled the barn. \"Actually, that\u0027s not entirely true.\"\\n\\n Lowering my voice further, I hastily recapped what had happened on my trip here with Sydney. I\u0027d never spoken of it to anyone.\\n\\n \"You must never, ever do that again,\" he said sternly.\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t mean to! It just happened.\"\\n\\n \"You panicked. You needed help, and some part of you called out to the spirits around you. Don\u0027t do it. It\u0027s not right, and it\u0027s easy to lose control.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know how I did it.\"\\n\\n \"Like I said, lapse of control. Don\u0027t ever let your panic get the best of you.\"\\n\\n An older woman passed us, a scarf over her head and a basket of vegetables in her arms. I waited until she was gone before asking Mark, \"Why did they fight for me?\"\\n\\n \"Because the dead hate Strigoi. The Strigoi are unnatural, neither living nor dead-just existing in some state in between. Just as we sense that evil, so do the ghosts.\"\\n\\n \"Seems like they could be a good weapon.\"\\n\\n That face, normally easy and open, frowned. \"It\u0027s dangerous. People like you and me already walk the edge of darkness and insanity. Openly calling upon the dead only brings us closer to falling over that edge and losing our minds.\" He glanced at his watch and sighed. \"Look, I have to go, but I\u0027m serious, Rose. Stay here. Stay out of trouble. Fight Strigoi if they come to you, but don\u0027t go seeking them blindly. And definitely leave the ghosts alone.\"\\n\\n It was a lot of advice to get in a grocery store, a lot of advice I wasn\u0027t sure I could follow. But I thanked him and sent my regards to Oksana before paying and leaving as well. I was heading back toward Olena\u0027s neighborhood when I rounded a corner and nearly walked right into Abe.\\n\\n He was dressed in his usual flashy way, wearing that expensive coat and a yellow-gold scarf that matched the gold in his jewelry. His guardians hovered nearby, and he leaned casually against a building\u0027s brick wall.\\n\\n \"So this is why you came to Russia. To go to the market like some peasant.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"Of course not.\"\\n\\n \"Just sightseeing then?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m just being helpful. Stop trying to get information out of me. You\u0027re not as smart as you think you are.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Look, I told you already. I came here to tell the Belikovs the news. So go back and tell whoever you\u0027re working for that that\u0027s that.\"\\n\\n \"And I told you before not to lie to me,\" he said. Again, I saw that odd mix of danger and humor. \"You have no idea how patient I\u0027ve been with you.\\n\\n From anyone else, I would have gotten the information I needed that first night.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky me,\" I snapped back. \"What now? Are you going to take me down an alley and beat me up until I tell you why I\u0027m here? I\u0027m losing interest in this whole scary-mob-boss routine, you know.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m losing patience with you,\" he said. There went the humor, and as he stood over me, I couldn\u0027t help but uneasily note that he was better built than most Moroi. A lot of Moroi avoided fights, but I wouldn\u0027t have been surprised if Abe had roughed up as many people as his bodyguards had. \"And honestly? I don\u0027t care why you\u0027re here anymore. You just need to leave. Now.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t threaten me, old man. I\u0027ll leave whenever the hell I want.\" It was funny, I\u0027d just sworn to Mark that I didn\u0027t know if I could stay in Baia, but when pressured by Abe, I just wanted to dig my feet in. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to keep me from, but I\u0027m not scared of you.\" That also wasn\u0027t entirely true.\\n\\n \"You should be,\" he returned pleasantly. \"I can be a very good friend or a very bad enemy. I can make it worth your while if you leave. We can strike a bargain.\"\\n\\n There was an almost excited gleam in his eyes as he spoke. I recalled Sydney describing him manipulating others, and I got the feeling this was what he lived for-negotiating, striking trades to get what he wanted.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll leave when I\u0027m ready. And there\u0027s nothing you or whoever you\u0027re working for can do about it.\"\\n\\n Hoping I appeared bold, I turned around. He reached out and grabbed my shoulder, jerking me back, nearly causing me to lose the groceries. I started to lunge forward in attack mode, but his guardians were right there in a flash. I knew I wouldn\u0027t get far.\\n\\n \"Your time is up here,\" hissed Abe. \"In Baia. In Russia. Go back to the U.S. I\u0027ll give you what you need-money, first-class tickets, whatever.\"\\n\\n I stepped out of his reach, backing carefully away. \"I don\u0027t need your help or your money-God only knows where it comes from.\" A group of people turned the corner across the street, laughing and talking, and I stepped back further, certain Abe wouldn\u0027t start a scene with witnesses present. It made me feel braver, which was probably stupid on my part. \"And I already told you: I\u0027ll go back whenever the hell I want.\"\\n\\n Abe\u0027s eyes lifted to the other pedestrians, and he too retreated back with his guardians. That chilling smile was on his face. \"And I told you. I can be a very good friend or a very bad enemy. Get out of Baia before you find out which.\"\\n\\n He turned around and left, much to my relief. I didn\u0027t want him to see just how much fear his words had left on my face.\\n\\n I went to bed early that night, suddenly feeling antisocial. I lay there for a while, flipping through another magazine I couldn\u0027t read, and amazingly found myself growing more and more tired. I think the encounters with Mark and Abe had exhausted me. Mark\u0027s words about staying had hit too close to home after my earlier conversation with Viktoria. Abe\u0027s thinly veiled threats had raised all my defenses, putting me on guard against whoever was working with him to make me leave Russia. At what point, I wondered, would he truly lose patience and stop trying to bargain?\\n\\n I drifted off to sleep and the familiar sense of an Adrian-dream settled around me. It had been a long time since this had happened, and I\u0027d actually thought he\u0027d listened to me when I\u0027d told him to stay away before. Of course, I always told him that. This had been the longest time span to go by without a visit, and as much as I hated to admit it, I\u0027d kind of missed him.\\n\\n The setting he\u0027d chosen this time was a piece of the Academy\u0027s property, a woodsy area near a pond. Everything was green and in bloom, and sunlight shone down on us. I suspected Adrian\u0027s creation didn\u0027t match what Montana\u0027s weather was really like right now, but then, he was in control. He could do whatever he wanted.\\n\\n \"Little dhampir,\" he said, smiling. \"Long time no see.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you were done with me,\" I said, sitting down on a large, smooth rock.\\n\\n \"Never done with you,\" he said, stuffing his hands in his pockets and strolling over to me. \"Although... to tell the truth, I did intend to stay away this time. But, well, I had to make sure you were still alive.\"\\n\\n \"Alive and well.\"\\n\\n He smiled down at me. The sun glinted off his brown hair, giving it golden-chestnut highlights. \"Good. You seem very well, actually. Your aura\u0027s better than I\u0027ve ever seen it.\" His eyes drifted from my face down to where my hands lay in my lap. Frowning, he knelt down and picked up my right hand. \"What\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n Oksana\u0027s ring was on it. Despite the ring\u0027s lack of ornamentation, the metal gleamed brightly in the light. The dreams were so strange. Even though Adrian and I weren\u0027t together, exactly, the ring had followed me in and kept its power enough that he could sense it.\\n\\n \"A charm. It\u0027s infused with spirit.\"\\n\\n Like me, this was apparently something he\u0027d never considered. His expression grew eager. \"And it heals, right? It\u0027s what\u0027s keeping some of the darkness from your aura.\"\\n\\n \"Some,\" I said, uneasy about his fixation on it. I took it off and slipped it into my pocket. \"It\u0027s temporary. I met another spirit user-and a shadowkissed dhampir.\"\\n\\n More surprise registered on his face. \"What? Where?\"\\n\\n I bit my lip and shook my head.\\n\\n \"Damn it, Rose! This is big. You know how Lissa and I have been looking for other spirit users. Tell me where they are.\"\\n\\n \"No. Maybe later. I don\u0027t want you guys coming after me.\" For all I knew, they were already after me, using Abe as their agent.\\n\\n His green eyes flashed angrily. \"Look, pretend for a moment the world doesn\u0027t revolve around you, okay? This is about Lissa and me, about understanding this crazy magic inside of us. If you\u0027ve got people who can help us, we need to know.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe later,\" I repeated stonily. \"I\u0027m moving on soon-then I\u0027ll tell you.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you always so difficult?\"\\n\\n \"Because you like me that way.\"\\n\\n \"At the moment? Not so much.\"\\n\\n It was the kind of joking comment Adrian usually made, but just then, something about it bothered me. For some reason, I got the tiniest, tiniest feeling that I suddenly wasn\u0027t as endearing to him as usual.\\n\\n \"Just try being patient,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m sure you guys have other stuff to work on. And Lissa seems pretty busy with Avery.\" The words slipped out before I could help it, and some of the bitterness and envy I\u0027d felt watching them the other night laced my tone.\\n\\n Adrian raised an eyebrow. \"Ladies and gentlemen, she admits it. You have been spying on Lissa-I knew it.\"\\n\\n I looked away. \"I just like to know she\u0027s alive too.\" As if I could go anywhere in the world and not know that.\\n\\n \"She is. Alive and well, like you. Er... mostly well.\" Adrian frowned. \"Sometimes I get this strange vibe off of her. She doesn\u0027t seem quite right or her aura will flicker a little. Never lasts long, but I still worry.\" Something in Adrian\u0027s voice softened. \"Avery worries about her too, so Lissa\u0027s in good hands. Avery\u0027s pretty amazing.\"\\n\\n I gave him a scathing look. \"Amazing? Do you like her or something?\" I hadn\u0027t forgotten Avery\u0027s comment about leaving the door unlocked for him.\\n\\n \"Of course I like her. She\u0027s a great person.\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean like. Not like.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I see,\" he said, rolling his eyes. \"We\u0027re dealing with elementary school definitions of ¡®like.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not answering the question.\"\\n\\n \"Well, like I said, she\u0027s a great person. Smart. Outgoing. Beautiful.\"\\n\\n Something in the way he said \"beautiful\" bugged me. I averted my eyes again, playing with the blue nazar around my neck as I tried to parse my feelings. Adrian figured things out first.\\n\\n \"Are you jealous, little dhampir?\"\\n\\n I looked back up at him. \"No. If I was going to be jealous over you, I would have gone crazy a long time ago, considering all the girls you mess around with.\"\\n\\n \"Avery\u0027s not the kind of girl you mess around with.\"\\n\\n Again, I heard that affection in his voice, that dreaminess. It shouldn\u0027t have bothered me. I should have been glad he was interested in another girl. After all, I\u0027d been trying to convince him to leave me alone for a very long time. Part of the conditions of him giving me money for this trip had involved me promising to give him a fair shot at dating when-and if-I returned to Montana. If he got together with Avery, it would be one less thing for me to worry about.\\n\\n And honestly, if it had been any other girl except Avery, I probably wouldn\u0027t have minded. But somehow, the idea of her enchanting him was just too much. Wasn\u0027t it bad enough that I was losing Lissa to her? How was it possible that one girl could so easily take my place? She\u0027d stolen my best friend, and now the guy who\u0027d sworn up and down that I was the one he wanted was seriously considering replacing me.\\n\\n You\u0027re being a hypocrite, a stern voice inside of me said. Why should you feel so wronged about someone else coming into their lives? You abandoned them. Lissa and Adrian both. They have every right to move on.\\n\\n I stood up angrily. \"Look, I\u0027m done talking to you tonight. Will you let me out of this dream? I\u0027m not telling you where I am. And I\u0027m not interested in hearing about how wonderful Avery is and how much better than me she is.\"\\n\\n \"Avery would never act like a little brat,\" he said. \"She wouldn\u0027t get so offended that someone actually cares enough to check on her. She wouldn\u0027t deny me the chance to learn more about my magic because she was paranoid someone would ruin her crazy attempt to get over her boyfriend\u0027s death.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk to me about being a brat,\" I shot back. \"You\u0027re as selfish and self-centered as usual. It\u0027s always about you-even this dream is. You hold me against my will, whether I want it or not, because it amuses you.\"\\n\\n \"Fine,\" he said, voice cold. \"I\u0027ll end this. And I\u0027ll end everything between us. I won\u0027t be coming back.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I hope you mean it this time.\"\\n\\n His green eyes were the last thing I saw before I woke up in my own bed.\\n\\n I sat up, gasping. My heart felt like it was breaking, and I almost thought I might cry. Adrian was right-I had been a brat. I\u0027d lashed out at him when it wasn\u0027t really deserved. And yet... I hadn\u0027t been able to help it. I missed Lissa. I even kind of missed Adrian.

During this journey, Rose finds herself in situations she would never have imagined--mob-like characters whose intentions are ambiguous, other aspects of Moroi life she was not privvy to, along with her first encounter with a dhampir commune, meeting other dhampirs with a vendetta like her, and finally, her heart stopping confrontation with Dimitri. No spoilers will be given, for that would take away at the amazing story Mead has created, but rest assured, you have seen absolutely nothing yet. \\n The novel was a mind-blowing experience full of amazing adventures and action that showed no signs of letting up at any point during the reading. Richelle Mead\u0027s writing has grown more sophisticated and despite the dark setting is full of humor and will make you race through the pages, leaving yourself blinking at the last page wondering where all the time went.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-promise-vampire-academy-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:04:26 AM"}}
