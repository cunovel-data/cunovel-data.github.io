And when you hear five thousand confessions a year for forty years, you by no means know all about people, but you do know all people.\" \"I do not mean types. I mean persons.\" \"Oh, I know a dozen or so well, a few thousands somewhat less.\" \"Would it be possible to know a hundred thousand people, a half million?\" \"A mentalist might know that many to recognize; I don\u0027t know the limit. But darkened man has a limit set on everything.\" \"Could a somehow emancipated man know more?\" \"The only emancipated man is the corporally dead man. And the dead man, if he attains the beatific vision, knows all other persons who have ever been since time began.\" \"All the billions?\" \"All.\" \"With the same brain?\" \"No. But with the same mind.\" \"Then wouldn\u0027t even a believer have to admit that the mind which we have now is only a token mind? Would not any connection it would have with a completely comprehensive mind be very tenuous? Would we really be the same person if so changed? It is like saying a bucket would hold the ocean if it were fulfilled, which only means filled full. How could it be the same mind?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Anthony went to see a psychologist. \"How many people do you know, Dr. Shirm?\" \"I could be crabby and say that I know as many as I want to; but it wouldn\u0027t be the truth. I rather like people, which is odd in my profession. What is it that you really want to know?\" \"How many people can one man know?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter very much. People mostly overestimate the number of their acquaintances. What is it that you are trying to ask me?\" \"Could one man know everyone?\" \"Naturally not. But unnaturally he might seem to. There is a delusion to this effect accompanied by an euphoria, and it is called—\" \"I don\u0027t want to know what it is called. Why do specialists use Latin and Greek?\" \"One part hokum, and two parts need; there simply not being enough letters in the alphabet of exposition without them. It is as difficult to name concepts as children, and we search our brains as a new mother does. It will not do to call two children or two concepts by one name.\" \"Thank you. I doubt that this is delusion, and it is not accompanied by euphoria.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2215/62239.html","bookId":594,"book":{"id":594,"title":"All The People","description":"简介： Anthony Trotz went first to the politician, Mike Delado.
