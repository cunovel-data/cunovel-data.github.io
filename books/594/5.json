{"id":13042,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"He had to confide in someone. \n \n He spoke to Wellington who also worked in his room. \"I know a girl in Beirut who is just going to bed. It is evening there now, you know.\" \n \n \"That so? Why don\u0027t they get their time straightened out? I met a girl last night that\u0027s cute as a correlator key, and kind of shaped like one. She doesn\u0027t know yet that I work in the center and am a restricted person. I\u0027m not going to tell her. Let her find out for herself.\" \n \n It was no good trying to tell things to Wellington. Wellington never listened. And then Anthony got a summons to Colonel Peter Cooper, which always increased his apprehension. \n \n \"Anthony,\" said the colonel, \"I want you to tell me if you discern anything unusual. That is really your job, to report anything unusual. The other, the paper shuffling, is just something to keep your idle hands busy. Now tell me clearly if anything unusual has come to your notice.\" \n \n \"Sir, it has.\" And then he blurted it all out. \"I know everybody! I know everybody in the world. I know them all in their billions, every person. It has me worried sick.\" \n \n \"Yes, yes, Anthony. But tell me, have you noticed anything odd? It is your duty to tell me if you have.\" \n \n \"But I have just told you! In some manner I know every person in the world. I know the people in Transvaal, I know the people in Guatemala. I know everybody.\" \n \n \"Yes, Anthony, we realize that. And it may take a little getting used to. But that isn\u0027t what I mean. Have you (besides that thing that seems out of the way to you) noticed anything unusual, anything that seems out of place, a little bit wrong?\" \n \n \"Ah—besides that and your reaction to it, no, sir. Nothing else odd. I might ask, though, how odd can a thing get? But other than that—no, sir.\" \n \n \"Good, Anthony. Now remember, if you sense anything odd about anything at all, come and tell me. No matter how trivial it is, if you feel that something is just a little bit out of place, then report it at once. Do you understand that?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir.\" \n \n But he couldn\u0027t help wondering what it might be that the colonel would consider a little bit odd. \n \n Anthony left the center and walked. He shouldn\u0027t have. He knew that they became impatient with him when he wandered off from his work. \n \n \"But I have to think. I have all the people in the world in my brain, and still I am not able to think. This power should have come to someone able to take advantage of it.\" \n \n He went into the Plugged Nickel Bar, but the man on duty knew him for a restricted person from the filter center, and would not serve him. \n \n He wandered disconsolately about the city. \"I know the people in Omaha and those in Omsk. What queer names have the towns of the earth! I know everyone in the world, and when anyone is born or dies. And Colonel Cooper did not find it unusual. Yet I am to be on the lookout for things unusual. The question rises, would I know an odd thing if I met it?\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2215/62242.html","bookId":594,"book":{"id":594,"title":"All The People","description":"简介： Anthony Trotz went first to the politician, Mike Delado.
