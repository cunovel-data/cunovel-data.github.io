Unfortunately, there are no streets by that name in Wichita, KS. Described as a loner in the orphanage, her adult life is much the same--save for a Lhasa Apso anklebiter named Achilles. She\u0027s an investigative reporter working the paranormal beat at WTCH TV in Wichita, KS. So, she spends a lot of time watching TV. She\u0027s stunned when \"CSI Vegas V\" comes on showing a cadaver being dissected that could be her twin--right down to the topaz nose ring she wears.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dancing-with-werewolves-delilah-street-1.jpg","author":"Carole Nelson Douglas","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":19,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
