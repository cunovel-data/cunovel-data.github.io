{"id":92266,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Chapter Ten\n I woke up the next day and checked the Araby Motel\u0027s scratchy sheets first thing.\n My panties had passed the period test last night. No blood. My dreams had been vaguely gory, sometimes a prelude to my periods, but the sheets passed too.\n No \"virginal\" spot of blood, m\u0027Lord. She is fit to marry a King. Of course she could just be pregnant...\n I sighed, trying to come to grips with my sudden new Sunset Park side: sexy chick.\n I\u0027d always tried to act like a hip modern girl, especially once I\u0027d got out into the working world, but sometimes I thought I was an oddball escapee from some forgotten fairy tale. I didn\u0027t remember a lot about my \"wonder\" years when things like hormones and periods and what guys might want appeared on the horizon.\n Any shrink could tell you that never being adopted might lead to self-esteem issues. On top of that, my vamp-attracting coloring meant I\u0027d had to stand up solo and secretly to the older bad boys who kept recycling back to the orphanage from foster home after foster home. All of them had long tails of initials in their case files, and half of them were OOW (out-of-wedlock) unwanted half-vampire spawn.\n Every jaunt in and out of the institution just made them nastier.\n Our Lady of the Lake convent school was a relief in getting away from the bad boys, being a girls\u0027 school, but the other students all had homes and families and their own venom-tongued ways of tormenting someone different.\n By the time I hit college, working like a stevedore to earn living expenses, a social life was an afterthought. Somewhere, sometime after my institutional stays, I had the impression that I was no longer a virgin, in terms of not bleeding if you pricked me. Imagine how the fairy tale would have gone if Sleeping Beauty couldn\u0027t bleed? But I didn\u0027t remember when or how or who. Or what.\n I also didn\u0027t remember a couple of heavy drinking college parties very well either. Maybe then. Whatever had happened, if it had, I came out of it with memory loss, nightmares, and such an aversion to vampire lunges and to lying on my back that the dentist had to work on me sitting up.\n During my last year at the group home, my dreams of a humiliating and terrifying \"alien abduction\" pelvic exam began, mixed up with vamp boy attacks. That drove me in high school to the underground drug sellers for the \"others.\" A lot of teen female werewolves had period difficulties during their \"change,\" and I could get the Pill without a prescription or a pelvic, since many doctors still wouldn\u0027t treat supernaturals. No one ever questioned my supernatural credentials. They were selling meds like street drugs. Besides, who would want to masquerade as an outcast? All this shady rigmarole to get the Pill made me feel neurotic and squeamish and childish. From what I\u0027d heard, women my age had abortions with less angst than I produced for a P.E.\n So it wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t want male company or affection or that I didn\u0027t dream that someday my prince would come. It\u0027s that the dreams I remembered were always of a huge pale stingray hanging over me. I couldn\u0027t breathe... was I underwater? Being held underwater? Being held down? A lot of working women had that dream. The stingray\u0027s flaccid white wings were arched and veined like a bat\u0027s, and became a black shadow above me, diving down, smothering me.\n So I had some sexual hang-ups. My mind veered away whenever my thoughts wandered too close to the mystery. But it wasn\u0027t rape. I\u0027d never thought that was my problem. That nail file had done the job.\n It was even harder to veer away from my old edgy emotions and fears now, after feeling that bolt of earthy energy from the ground under my feet, from the man behind me, whose hands in front of mine had tapped into all that subterranean sexuality.\n Maybe my prince had come.\n Literally.\n So the good news at this point was that my sudden sogginess wasn\u0027t my usually predictable period after all. The bad news was that I\u0027d never had much luck playing well with men and I might be heading for another major disappointment. At least my ��ber-headache was gone and I didn\u0027t remember dreams of any kind from last night whatsoever. Round one to Ric Montoya. Too bad I didn\u0027t have time to moon over him a little.\n I had a lot of other things to do, Hector Nightwine still looming number one on my A-list. I\u0027d come back from the breakfast buffet at the Lotsa-Slotsa-Fun on this gentrification-doomed low-end part of the Strip when my phone rang at 11:00 am on the dot.\n My first phone call in Vegas! I let it ring two more times for sheer pleasure before I panicked and flipped it open. In the meantime I fantasized that Hector Nightwine\u0027s secretary... a male secretary named Niven... was on the line begging me to see his boss. Hmmm, my fantasies were definitely perking up.\n \"Hello.\"\n \"Good morning. It\u0027s Ric.\"\n Number two. Not bad.\n \"Ye-es?\" I\u0027d never turned one word into two with that little purring note in my voice. Get it together, girl! Irma nagged me.\n \"I\u0027m back in the park.\" And he gave great phone voice.\n \"Oh.\" Was it going to be their place?\n \"I wondered if you could come over before noon.\"\n Hmm. Charming hot-dog-stand lunch in the park. Feeding bun breadcrumbs to the ducks. Settling down at \"their\" picnic table. Arranging something more formal. Dinner perhaps. Plus I could keep an eye on Hector\u0027s place and maybe figure out how to storm the palace somehow.\n \"Sure.\"\n No, girlfriend! Hard to get.\n Too late.\n That is no way you play a hot guy, a fashion stud right out of GQ, honey.\n I gagged my inner girlfriend. Sometimes she is way too shallow.\n Ric seemed a serious guy underneath the high-end accessories. He obviously believed he could dowse for water, and... maybe he could. I have an open mind. But maybe I\u0027d better consider wearing a Lite Days pad if we\u0027re rendezvousing in the park again. Those dowsing rod visions seemed to have touched something in me nothing, or no one, ever had before.\n Still, visions of sedate sugarplums danced in my convent-bred head. A stroll, maybe an ice cream cone for dessert in the desert. Something sweet, mundane, and old-fashioned. Pure Kansas corn.\n I parked Dolly in a lot off Sunset Road and walked back to the area where I\u0027d met Ric. It\u0027s a huge park, with tennis and golfing areas, but I kept bearing west until I spied Kon Tiki (my nickname for Mr. Easter Island head). He got me near where I needed to be.\n I stop, bemused. There is a dreamlike quality to the scene I walk into slowly. Time slows down like lazy molasses.\n The park right here is teeming with busy men in suits and buff uniformed cops in buff-colored uniforms: Bermuda shorts and short-sleeved shirts that showcase tanned biceps and quads. The air buzzes with walkie-talkie communications. Chrome yellow Crime Scene: do not cross tape wraps several of the dead-dedicated trees, cordoning off a pizza-pie-shaped slice of the open ground.\n A chill runs up my spine when I triangulate between the reeds on the west, Kon Tiki\u0027s dour face on the lake\u0027s central island, and Sunset Road. This is \"our\" place and suddenly, this summer, it is verboten to anyone not among the city\u0027s law enforcement crowd.\n \u0027\"Scuse me, miss.\" Officer Buff is looming beside me. \"This area is off-limits to the public.\"\n Luckily I\u0027m stunned into silence long enough for an equally authoritative voice behind me to announce, \" Miss Street is with me.\"\n Ric Montoya is standing behind me. As has become usual for us. His designer sunglasses with their titanium frames only enhance his strong cheekbones, aristocratic nose, knife-edge jaw. He is still just as good-looking, just as professional, and he is eyeing me like I am a ten of clubs in a game of Twenty-One. Keep or fold?\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\" I ask when Officer Buff has withdrawn in a state of high grouch. I know his type. Works out, hits the tanning beds, and thinks he\u0027s the cat\u0027s pajamas. Likes to pull over helpless women on a pretext, and if they\u0027re young and alone, screw them.\n \"Something I thought you should see,\" Ric says.\n I eye the Crime Scene tape. I\u0027ve been here before, at crime scenes in Kansas, with a camera crew. But not after melting down the previous evening on this very spot.\n \"I know it\u0027ll be hard.\" Ric is standing very close to me, face-to-face this time, his fingertips on my elbows. He has excellent fingertip technique no matter the occasion. \"I know you saw something... awful. I felt that too. You need to see what\u0027s really there.\"\n \"I do?\"\n He leans away, stung. \"No, you\u0027re right. I do. Maybe we do. I won\u0027t let go of you.\"\n How many women have dreamed of hearing that from the right guy? But I know how he means it. Literally. He won\u0027t let go of me. We\u0027ll be linked. In touch. And he knows what this is about.\n I nod. I\u0027m a tough girl. I\u0027ve seen dead people before.\n Ric leads us to the tape, where we\u0027re questioned again. Ric flashes an ID. \"The captain okayed it.\"\n \"You maybe. Her too?\"\n \"A new associate, Miss Street.\"\n The middle-aged officer is all on-duty starch. I could be a naked Madonna impersonator and he wouldn\u0027t blink an eye. \"Go ahead.\"\n We duck under the familiar yellow plastic ribbon, not attached to an old oak tree but to small pine and ash trees. Out-of-the-blue songs are running through my mind, the windmills in my mind. Interior distraction for what I might be seeing all too soon.\n Ric leads me to where we stood together only last twilight. There is now an actual pit, larger than a bread box; say the size of a grave site, all the better to accommodate the CSI crew kneeling around the revealed centerpiece. This is a pair of interlocked skeletons lying in a tomb of desiccated limestone. A hard night\u0027s digging work. Someone really wanted them six feet under.\n The skeletons seem blissful, even rapturous, unaware of their gruesome state, or even of when death came. Grinning skulls face each other in profile, all the teeth in place, as clean and even as pearl bangles. The spines and ribs are collapsed, but the arm bones intertwine, and the large leg bones tangle with each other forming a horizontal ladder. It\u0027s hard for a civilian like me to discern the finger and foot bones, but something about the pair\u0027s cuddling position, now eternal, screams young lovers.\n When you\u0027re about to faint it\u0027s just like in those movie special-effects sequences. You stay fixed in place and the foreground is rushing away from your senses as if you were on a departing French super-train. Zoom.\n Because I now find myself hit with a rerun of the exact visceral blend of high-impact sex and death I\u0027d felt yesterday afternoon. These dry bones, so sedate now, are the writhing, naked, ultimately blood-soaked limbs of the coupling couple of my vision.\n \"Male and female,\" I mutter at Ric.\n \"Good. What else?\"\n \"Passion and death.\"\n \"Is it ever different?\"\n I ignore his cynicism, too busy tapping my own.\n \"Murder.\"\n His hands tighten on my upper arms.\n I frown. \"Old.\"\n \"Old? Who?\"\n \"Old. Just old. Believe me, I know old!\"\n He stands behind me like a wall, his fingertips reading the tremors of my nerves and skin.\n \"Thanks,\" Ric says. \"Don\u0027t say anything. The lead detective is coming. He\u0027ll be a pain. Let me answer.\"\n \"I speak for myself.\"\n \"When you know the ground.\"\n \"These are my... corpses.\"\n \"Mine too. Shhh. Delilah.\" He whispers in my ear. Touches it with the tip of his tongue.\n Well, that worked. I am pretty much speechless. How did he know my first name? How did he know how to shut me up?\n The plainclothes man swaggers over, dripping dislike. I can see why. He is short, squat, vampire-pale without any of the mystique that goes with a professional bloodsucker.\n \"If it ain\u0027t the Cadaver Kid again,\" he says to Ric. \"I heard you were nosing around. Montoya.\" The voice is grating, egotistical, and, my very favorite thing to go after with a nail file, bullying.\n \"Detective Haskell.\" Ric\u0027s voice sounds icy but I can sense he is super hot under that cool white collar. I\u0027m suddenly very attuned to what\u0027s under that cool white collar. \"The captain likes me to eyeball these crime scenes. And I did call it in.\"\n \"You. Not your little casino luck-piece tootsie.\"\n I stiffen as much as Ric had done on me yesterday. His hands clamp like handcuffs on my arms, a dislocated gag, but I get the message.\n \" Miss Street is a fellow professional,\" he says, smooth as variated tinted glass in a 24-carat gold-accented frame. \"An associate.\"\n \"And what\u0027s your specialty, sister? Knee-work?\"\n I tear loose of Ric and round on the Lieutenant. He\u0027s middle-aged, middle-gutted, middling-haired; every position-loving, not-very-sharp man who likes to throw his considerable weight around instead of doing his job.\n I draw on all the interviews I\u0027ve done with women in law enforcement.\n \" Quantico didn\u0027t think so, Lieutenant, when I took their serial killer workshop with John Douglas. Granted this is all theoretical and speculative compared to what you might dig up from beat work, but you have male/ female vies here, you have major trauma to the remaining bones, which indicates an ultra-violent-and bizarrely controlled-end. You have coitus interruptus, which guarantees a textbook-sick perp, and you have very old bones, which means a very... cold... case.\"\n The guy stands paralyzed.\n \"Remind me,\" Ric murmurs in my same damn oversensitive ear, \"to forget about getting a pit bull.\"\n \"So you\u0027re FBI too,\" Detective Haskell says. \"Ex-FBI like our Meskin friend here?\"\u0027\n At first I don\u0027t get the word, \"Meskin,\" but Ric\u0027s fingers digging into my upper arms allow me to translate it, pronto.\n \"Right,\" I say. Claiming to be ex-FBI gives me much more status than admitting to being a reporter. An ex-reporter. \"And I didn\u0027t quite get what you just said.\"\n Haskell doesn\u0027t bother to translate. He just eyes Ric with an ugly smile. \"Our Cadaver Kid here is one lucky bastard. Got a nose for dead bodies. Me, I think the whole thing stinks. Maybe he\u0027s really working for the Christophe syndicate or one of the other mob czars in town and just knows where all the bodies are buried.\"\n Before this confrontation can deteriorate any more, it\u0027s interrupted by a cry from the gravesite.\n \"Most of the clothes are rotted to threads,\" a woman\u0027s voice calls from the pit, \"but we\u0027ve found some surviving artifacts.\"\n She\u0027s right to call any finds \"artifacts.\" This is almost an archeological site. I recall glimpses of cast-off clothes and am starting to date them. Quantico Girl? No. Retro Girl. Yes.\n A quart-size plastic bag holding a heavy load of large silver dollar coins is passed up.\n \"Wanta bet there are thirty of them?\" Ric murmurs in my ear.\n Then a sandwich baggie holding something small and black is also passed up to Officer Buff, but Haskell snags it. He stares at it, then eyes me with mean triumph.\n \"A gambling chip,\" he says. Tells me. \"From the Inferno. So much for your \u0027old\u0027 theory, babe. So, Montoya. You came, you saw, you bombed. Get yourself and Quantico Girl outahere.\"\n We retreat a few yards. Once we\u0027re alone, I fight not to double over and barf. Because I re-feel their pain, this live-dead couple. Interlocked bones, loved to death. I\u0027ve seen them at their best and at their worst. Vies. I know the lingo, but it makes them into pawns, not people who lived and breathed and loved at one time.\n I think about how everything I own could be pawned. Achilles\u0027 urn. My own soul.\n Ric is shaking me loose of my flashback. \"You\u0027ll have to tell me what you saw later.\"\n He\u0027s frowning behind the sunglasses. They prevent sun damage and don\u0027t hurt his looks at all. Does every woman fixate on him like this, or just me? What is going on?\n \"He called you-\" I start to say.\n \"He lives to offend. Anyway, it\u0027s true.\"\n \"Well, yeah, but... hey, what\u0027s really bothering you?\"\n \"Besides you?\" The easy humor is back. And then the frown. \"The Inferno is the hottest hotel-casino in town for the Pseudo-Goth-Hypehead-Decadent set.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"It opened three years ago.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay. Silver dollars haven\u0027t been used for gambling in this city since the price-run on silver in the seventies. It\u0027s up to the coroner\u0027s office to determine the time of death. Those bones looked well seasoned to me.\"\n \"It\u0027s not only that. I... saw... shards of their clothes, jewelry. Particularly hers. Strictly late forties or early fifties.\"\n He\u0027s smiling down at me. \"They teach you that at \u0027 Quantico \u0027?\u0027\"\n \"No, but they should have, if I\u0027d been there. I have worked as an investigative TV reporter. I covered ritual murders, although in Kansas they were cattle mutilations, most often. Are you really ex-FBI?\"\n \"Yeah. What about it?\"\n \"You\u0027re the best freaking dressed Fed I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n \"Maybe that\u0027s why I\u0027m \u0027ex.\u0027 Hey, I appreciate your coming over here. I wanted to establish that we have a right to be on this case. I didn\u0027t expect it, but you cooked Haskell\u0027s goose.\"\n We? This case? Maybe. But I\u0027ve got my own cases to solve, my own bones to pick.\n Bone number one is not who Ric is, but what. We walk away from the crime scene for a heart to heart.\n Chapter Eleven\n \"Now that we\u0027re alone, Ric, tell me what happened here. This murder scene is what the dowsing rod targeted last night, and I saw it. Only I saw that couple alive, and being killed. I\u0027ve never had daylight nightmares before. You must have had something to do with it. You\u0027re a water witch, aren\u0027t you?\"\n Ric winced at my last phrase. \u0027\u0027Water dowser. It\u0027s a respected... faculty among rural folk all over the world. I can do it a bit now, but it\u0027s not my particular gift. It\u0027s not any part of this Millennium Revelation upsurge in supernaturals and freaks at all. I\u0027m not a freak. I\u0027m not a witch or a wizard of anything. Just a guy with a quirky family gene.\"\n \"So what\u0027s your \u0027faculty,\u0027 if not finding water?\"\n He looked away, maybe appealing to the island god for inspiration so that I\u0027d believe him.\n \"Most dowsers do find water. A very few find precious metals and stones. I\u0027m unique, as far as I know. I see dead people. Underground. That\u0027s what I do. Know they\u0027re there.\"\n \"That\u0027s what you consult about?\"\n He nodded. \"Law enforcement people are pig-headed and pride themselves on that. They just think I\u0027m superbly educated and well-trained.\" He gave a self-effacing grin. \"Which I was, no thanks to myself.\"\n There was a story there, but I\u0027d get it later. I can wait.\n \"A lot of them like to think I\u0027m just lucky,\" he added. \"I let them believe that I have a photographic memory for news stories. Most dead bodies in wrong places are MIAs. Someone\u0027s missing; somebody\u0027s reported something, if you look hard enough. Which I do. After the fact.\"\n He met my eyes again. \"You seem to have some folk faculty yourself.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t literally see them, the victims?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see anything that specific. The dowsing rod draws me to the grave. I report it and the authorities always find a body. Or bodies. Sometimes they\u0027re more than human. Or less.\"\n I shuddered. \"Are you saying -?\"\n \"Yeah. Human murder victims are the simplest. Sometimes the bodies are staked vamps, victims of vigilante attacks. Other things.\"\n \"In this case, you didn\u0027t sense the bodies\u0027 pre-death... agony? Their-\" I didn\u0027t know how to put it.\n \"Their heat? Yeah. I got that this time, but only through your reaction.\" His bedroom eyes apparently couldn\u0027t resist giving me a visual pat down. \"It adds a whole new dimension to my work, believe me.\"\n I was blushing now, and on me, it always showed.\n He managed to ignore that, at least. \"This crime... feels... like revenge for infidelity. I\u0027ve never picked that up before, never anything about means or motive. We make a hell of a combo, Delilah. I wasn\u0027t kidding about you being an associate.\"\n Maybe. But he\u0027d just seen me reacting to what I\u0027d felt. He hadn\u0027t experienced it, not both the glory and the gory. I didn\u0027t like hanging out there on the naked edge like that, my emotions showing like a black lace slip under a white satin gown, literally in some strange guy\u0027s hands.\n \"I\u0027ve got my own agenda here to take care of.\"\n \"I noticed. Now you know my secret. So what\u0027s eating you?\"\n I jerked my head toward Sunset Road. \"I\u0027d sure like to get an appointment with the man behind that wall but I can\u0027t even get past the driveway gate to the security call box inside.\"\n Ric turned to eye the imposing property.\n \"There? Easy. I\u0027ve been hanging in this park long enough to notice the pool service truck that coasts through those gates every day at four pm. If you can hitch your wagon to a chlorine machine, you\u0027re in.\"\n \"Thank you!\"\n My watch read 1:00 pm. I had time to plan.\n Ric fingered my elbow-length mesh sleeves. Holding a dowsing rod like a psychic set of reins had given him a touch that could veer from sheer gossamer to a grip of iron. I\u0027d felt that as intimately as I\u0027d seen and experienced the dead couple\u0027s passion and death.\n \"I\u0027ll be in touch, Delilah. Okay?\"\n Oh, yeah, even though my knees were knocking about what that might mean.\n Or maybe because they were.\n Chapter Twelve\n Three hours to kill. Oops. That phrase had an ugly echo in Sunset Park now that I\u0027d viewed the skeletons in the ground.\n I wandered around, avoiding the crime scene I\u0027d been banned from. I bought my own hot dog and drenched it in mustard that made my mouth pucker, avoiding onions for my possible interview later. I stared at the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse across the street, meditating on Hector Nightwine and who, or what, he might be. Nice man, bogeyman, entrepreneur, thief?\n At the lower end of the park, I spotted a dog run and stood watching from a distance, sawdust in my throat. I couldn\u0027t help being drawn there, thinking of Achilles. The signs advertised obedience trials at 5:00 pm every day. The word \"obedience\" made me smile through my tears. Achilles wasn\u0027t big on obedience but he was spot-on about everything I needed. Loyalty. Spirit. Elegance. Love.\n My throat was clogging, caught in a vise. Here I was, a new woman in a new city, and my past still had me by the throat harder than any vampire.\n Las Vegas SPCA the sign read. Women bustled around wire cages while I wandered among them, eavesdropping. What else is a reporter but a professional snoop? Just browsing.\n \"Gosh, I hope one of these guys goes soon,\" a petite redhead fretted as I passed. \"The city shelter will have to kill any one that comes back today.\"\n \"Maybe we should put a sign out.\" The plump, gray-haired woman sounded bitterly passionate. \u0027\"Adopt me now or I die tomorrow.\u0027\"\n \"Shhh! Truth doesn\u0027t get good homes. People can\u0027t face that.\"\n I\u0027d seen death up close and personal at the park\u0027s other end. I couldn\u0027t face a return encounter here. So I hunted for an Achilles look-alike. Small, white, cute.\n These were all big dogs. Crossbred. Unwanted.\n One in particular hunched hopelessly in a big wire crate still way too small for it. It was a shaggy gray ghost of a dog, ten times Achilles\u0027 size, nothing cute and apartment-sized about it.\n I approached the cage, then tapped the wires to see the most beautiful pale blue eyes ever, way better than my own, turn to me from a silver-and-cream furred face. A widow\u0027s peak of darker fur over those amazing eyes made them seem almost human.\n \"Too big,\" I heard the women whisper behind me. \"What a shame.\"\n Am I easy? Maybe. Or maybe I\u0027m just ambitious.\n \"How big?\" I turned to ask.\n \"A hundred and fifty pounds. He\u0027s definitely from the wolf-spitz family, but really big for the breed. Maybe a touch of Irish wolfhound or Alaskan malamute in him. The eyes are blue, but pale to gray in the right light. Random-breds are hard to tell sometimes, you know?\"\n No, I didn\u0027t know, except for the hole in my heart. I scanned the organization\u0027s single-spaced adoption papers. Eighty dollars, no other pets, a permanent address...\n I copied Ric Montoya\u0027s street address in the appropriate blanks.\n \"Really? You want this guy? He\u0027s a monster dog. You\u0027ll need to exercise him daily.\"\n \"I run,\" I told them. \"A lot.\"\n So forty minutes later I walked out of the area with a huge gray dog wearing the black leather-and-steel two-inch-wide collar he came with, attached to a new limp nylon half-inch-wide leash, blue with white letters reading Nevada SPCA.\n He will go where I lead, and that\u0027s to Sunset Road coming up on 4:00 pm.\n \"Okay,\" I told him like he could get it. \"I\u0027m new here too. We\u0027ve got to swing on a star and get into this place by hook or by crook. You ready?\"\n The pale blue eyes said yes.\n We lurked outside in the juniper bushes until the pool service truck paused, then gunned past the electrically opened gate. We slipped in after the truck. I led. He followed. I held his leash. He already held my heart.\n Can we really storm this castle? And, if so, who will care?\n The truck chugged past the second round of gates, but I spotted the needed squawk box here. Also a camera eye. I\u0027m attuned to recognizing cameras. I went on tiptoe to hit the lever and speak my piece into the impersonal infrared eye.\n \"Hi, Mister Nightwine. My name is Delilah Street. I\u0027m a TV reporter from the heartland, and I\u0027ve got a few questions about a dead body on a recent episode of Las Vegas CSI V.\"\n I heard the echo of my own words. Recorded. Dismissed. No go.\n Suddenly the box squawked back at me, sounding like a televangelist. Rotund. Ponderous. With great big bad hair.\n \" Miss Street. My deepest apologies for keeping you and your, er, associate, waiting. My man will be down post haste.\"\n \"Post haste,\" I told my new dog.\n He tilted his huge head, then whimpered and strained at his leash, showing his teeth in a big grin. My God, he had a maw the size of a grizzly bear\u0027s! Good dog.\n When the butler appeared he was half what I dreamed him to be: natty, with an amiable, worry-corrugated forehead. A forty-something dude with a bit too much tummy and a smidge too little chin, but charming nonetheless. Not sexy, but certainly cute, especially with that pencil-thin mustache. I pictured Ric with same and was so not turned off that I banished that idea... post haste.\n This butler guy wore a real monkey suit from a Fred Astaire movie, white tie and tails, and his skin matched the outfit to a T. It was paler than any vampire could manage on his darkest day. He was a literal symphony in living black-and-white.\n \"Please come in, Miss Street. And your little dog too.\" He gave-whoever-a welcoming but sardonic grimace. \"However, I will keep custody of his, hmmm... leash, I suppose. Might as well put the Minotaur on a string. Gracious, he\u0027s ready to eat a grandmother-hopefully not mine-isn\u0027t he?\"\n Dog growled and showed his teeth. My, what big teeth he has!\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I told butler dude.\n Dog sat and lolled his tongue sideways out of his mouth. My, what a huge tongue he has!\n The butler I wanted to believe was named \"Niven\" led me down acres of marble and tile-paved hallways to show me into a magnificent office where a magisterial man of size, dressed all in black, bearded and mustached, awaited me.\n \"I will take Mister, ahem, Dog to the kitchen for a soup-bone repast,\" the butler announced. \"Don\u0027t worry, Miss. He\u0027ll be returned even fatter and happier than he left you.\"\n Since Dog looked lean and hungry and still somewhat sad at the moment, I hoped so.\n \"Fine,\" I said.\n \"Thank you, Godfrey,\" said my host. \"Do keep him out of the lamb for tonight\u0027s supper.\"\n Dog immediately turned and dragged Godfrey out of sight. This did not bode well for the lamb.\n We were alone now, and my heart was beating like one of the drums in Rod Stewart\u0027s \"The Rhythm of My Heart.\" It wasn\u0027t reacting the erratic way Ric Montoya made it hiccup, but with the steady elevated rate I felt when I was hot after a story.\n The magnificent office reminded me of Hearst Castle. I could barely absorb the details: enormously high coffered ceiling twinkling with gilt. Exquisitely carved wainscoting up to twelve feet, at least.\n \"Sit,\" Nightwine said before I could speak further. Did this feel like a dog-training class or what?\n I sat, surprising myself. The rococo wooden chair would easily hold an archbishop. I felt like Alice in Wonderland. My feet didn\u0027t even touch the thick Turkey rug under my feet and I\u0027m five-eight without heels.\n \"I must tell you, Miss... Street, you say?\"\n \"I say and am.\"\n \"I must tell you, Miss Street, that I won\u0027t tolerate any of my copyrights being violated. Should you wish to make an issue of this, I will sue you to Kingdom Come. Which, the pundits tell us, will be sooner than we anticipate or like, given what disagreeable and unforeseen events happened at the recent Millennium. On the other hand, if you are reasonable and we can come to a civilized agreement, you will find me very amenable indeed to deal with.\"\n That\u0027s when I realized that he took me for the double I saw playing the corpse on the CSI episode. That\u0027s when I also realized I had some decent pairs to play in my poker hand, primarily a deuce of queens: me and my double.\n I mustered my forces to explain my mission. \"I don\u0027t know what you think I\u0027m here for, Mr. Nightwine-\"\n \"A deal is a deal. You signed a contract. As you know, people clamor to play the corpses on my shows. Shopping mall auditions from here to Tokyo host hundreds and thousands of wannabe corpses. My show may pay the union minimum for a non-speaking extra, but the right corpse in the right episode can be in demand for speaking roles on other shows.\"\n \"I just had some questions.\"\n \"Speak to your agent. I can\u0027t recall if you had one or not.\"\n I took a gamble. \"No, it was just one of those mass open auditions.\"\n Nightwine\u0027s bulk deflated a bit, as if he was a puffer fish relaxing.\n \"As you will recall from the contract, Nightwine Productions bought all rights to your likeness in this particular role.\"\n \"Do you mean naked? Or dead?\"\n \"Both.\"\n \"Sort of puts some essential reins on my career.\"\n \"Of course we would give you a... dispensation, if a future role was not merely exploitive of your notoriety on my show.\"\n \"Notoriety?\"\n \"I meant that as a compliment. It\u0027s much more difficult to portray a corpse than most people appreciate. That glassy morning-glory stare, that graveyard pallor, all natural to you, I see. Unfortunately the obsessive fans pick up on successful corpses and there\u0027s a black market in blue movies featuring my former players. I can\u0027t allow that. If that\u0027s what you\u0027re here to discuss-\"\n \"Blue movies! No!\"\n \"Delighted to find you the lady-\" he caressed the word with a tongue that tied itself into a sensual knot of over-precise diction \"-your appearance on my dissecting table indicated you were.\"\n \"Your dissecting table?\"\n \"I oversee almost every autopsy on my shows. Attention to details is what has made them the most popular franchise in the world. We have more spin-off units than McDonalds.\"\n Yuck!\n \"It\u0027s possible that I might find a use for you on a future show. Perhaps even a one-line part, if you wore a wig and contact lenses. Perhaps green.\"\n \"I hate green.\"\n \"Aqua? That would be a suitable compromise. I see you have added a creature to your entourage.\"\n \"An entourage of one.\"\n \"Well, I approve, although he is somewhat large and galumphing.\"\n He could have been describing himself. I watched his beady dark eyes shift left and right. This was a man preparing to lie, or preparing to scam.\n \"My dear lady. I realize the compassion that spurred you to adopt such a beast-\"\n \"You do? How?\"\n He shrugged great rounded shoulders as black and looming as mountains in a Chinese print. \"Forgive me. My operations must be kept secret or I\u0027d be ripped off. I have an extensive security camera system. I couldn\u0027t help seeing you in the park.\"\n Voyeur! Did this creep see me dowsing with Ric? My pulse went stratospheric. I felt again the tempestuous emotions of the quick and the soon dead under the ground at my feet. And Ric\u0027s iron arms around me, his iron... never mind.\n Nightwine nattered on. \"The beast is huge and ungoverned yet might not be an impractical acquisition. However, where will you find rented quarters that will take him? Even apartments are supersonically priced around Las Vegas, and I\u0027m afraid very few will accept dogs, especially a dog of size like yours. Believe me, I do feel for him. Perhaps I can help you.\"\n \"Why are you being so... hospitable?\u0027\n \"You need a place to live where you can keep the dog.\"\n \"That\u0027s my problem.\"\n \"Yes, of course, but I do have a guesthouse on the premises. Completely separate entrance and egress, very charming, hot-and-cold running servants, laundry service, pool service.\"\n \"You propose that I rent from you?\"\n \"You\u0027ll find me a very amiable landlord.\"\n \"No. I\u0027ll find my own quarters, thank you. I prefer my independence.\"\n \"Then our discussion is over, I fear.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why you agreed to see me if you had so little to say.\"\n \"It\u0027s possible we could do business in future.\" Nightwine pursed his ruby lips. They were small and bee-stung and totally creepy. \"Perhaps you may reconsider. In time. My door is always open.\"\n \"Are you kidding? You have one of the most air-tight security systems I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n \"Flattery is also always welcome.\" His large, cerebral brow frowned. \"I do advise you to accept my offer.\"\n Was I detecting a faint, sweaty blossom of guilt on that Olympian brow? But why?\n \"I don\u0027t need charity. Why would you offer it?\"\n Nightwine\u0027s stern face softened into a beaming smile. \"It was simply such a pleasure to see you again, my dear, even on my black-and-white security camera. And in the flesh, in living color, well, you are a symphony of pale peach and sky blue and with that very dramatic black hair. I was out of the country during your dissection and didn\u0027t view your segment until the show aired, and your... portrayal was quite, quite breathtakingly lovely.\"\n He leaned forward to gaze at my bare legs as if they were basted with a golden almond-butterball glaze for Thanksgiving.\n Ghoul!\n Godfrey gave an Old World bow as he returned my new dog\u0027s scrawny temporary leash to my custody at the door when I left.\n \"Your associate was quite satisfied with the menu of our kitchens during your absence, Miss, but you\u0027d do well to pause at an establishment dedicated to the canine palette and fashion wardrobe after you leave us. Might I recommend a stronger leash? Forged steel, perhaps. Twelve gauge. There is a Pet Palace about two miles from here.\"\n I eyed the dog, who licked his chops, i.e., his huge white teeth, with his washcloth-sized tongue, much as Hector Nightwine had done while discussing my double\u0027s cameo appearance on an autopsy table.\n \"Thanks for the suggestion. Godfrey, is it?\"\n \"Yes, Miss.\"\n I gave him a high five that shocked the bejeesus out of him. \"Thanks, my man. We\u0027ll be in touch again.\"\n He shook his stinging white-gloved palm. \"I sincerely hope not, but you are always welcome otherwise.\"\n I doubted it. Hector had handed me the long goodbye, aka the brush-off.\n But Godfrey was right. The new owner of a mondo big dog needed a mondo big grooming and containing set. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dancing-with-werewolves-delilah-street-1/page-4.html","bookId":2113,"book":{"id":2113,"title":"Dancing with Werewolves (Delilah Street #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dancing With Werewolves (Delilah Street #1) \n Delilah Street has spotty recollection of her past, but knows she was named after the street where she was found.
