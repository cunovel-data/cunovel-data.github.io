{"id":107207,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"CHAPTER 1\n Robert Langdon awoke slowly.\n A telephone was ringing in the darkness - a tinny, unfamiliar ring. He fumbled for the bedside lamp and turned it on. Squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush Renaissance bedroom with Louis XVI furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.\n Where the hell am I?\n The jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: HOTEL RITZ PARIS.\n Slowly, the fog began to lift.\n Langdon picked up the receiver. \"Hello?\"\n \"Monsieur Langdon?\" a man\u0027s voice said. \"I hope I have not awoken you?\"\n Dazed, Langdon looked at the bedside clock. It was 12:32 A. M. He had been asleep only an hour, but he felt like the dead.\n \"This is the concierge, monsieur. I apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. He insists it is urgent.\"\n Langdon still felt fuzzy. A visitor? His eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.\n THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PARIS\n proudly presents\n AN EVENING WITH ROBERT LANGDON\n PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS SYMBOLOGY, HARVARD UNIVERSITY\n Langdon groaned. Tonight\u0027s lecture - a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of Chartres Cathedral - had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. Most likely, some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Langdon said, \"but I\u0027m very tired and - \" \"Mais, monsieur,\"the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. \"Your guest is an important man.\"\n Langdon had little doubt. His books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year Langdon\u0027s visibility had increased a hundred fold after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the Vatican. Since then, the stream of self- important historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.\n \"If you would be so kind,\" Langdon said, doing his best to remain polite,\" could you take the man\u0027s name and number, and tell him I\u0027ll try to call him before I leave Paris on Tuesday? Thank you.\" He hung up before the concierge could protest.\n Sitting up now, Langdon frowned at his bedside Guest Relations Handbook, whose cover boasted: SLEEP LIKE A BABY IN THE CITY OF LIGHTS. SLUMBER AT THE PARIS RITZ. He turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. The man staring back at him was a stranger - tousled and weary.\n You need a vacation, Robert.\n The past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn\u0027t appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. Although his female colleagues insisted the gray only accentuated his bookish appeal, Langdon knew better.\n If Boston Magazine could see me now.\n Last month, much to Langdon\u0027s embarrassment, Boston Magazine had listed him as one of that city\u0027s top ten most intriguing people - a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing by his Harvard colleagues. Tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced to haunt him at the lecture he had given.\n \"Ladies and gentlemen...\" the hostess had announced to a full house at the American University of Paris\u0027s Pavilion Dauphine,\" Our guest tonight needs no introduction. He is the author of numerous books: The Symbology of Secret Sects, The An of the Illuminati, The Lost Language of Ideograms, and when I say he wrote the book on Religious Iconology, I mean that quite literally. Many of you use his textbooks in class.\"\n The students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.\n \"I had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. However...\" She glanced playfully at Langdon, who was seated onstage. \"An audience member has just handed me a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction.\" She held up a copy of Boston Magazine. Langdon cringed. Where the hell did she get that?\n The hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and Langdon felt himself sinking lower and lower in his chair. Thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed no signs of letting up. \"And Mr. Langdon\u0027s refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last year\u0027s Vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter.\" The hostess goaded the crowd. \"Would you like to hear more?\"\n The crowd applauded.\n Somebody stop her, Langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.\n \"Although Professor Langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. His captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female students describe as \u0027chocolate for the ears.\u0027\n The hall erupted in laughter.\n Langdon forced an awkward smile. He knew what came next - some ridiculous line about\" Harrison Ford in Harris tweed\" - and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again to wear his Harris tweed and Burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.\n \"Thank you, Monique,\" Langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the podium. \"Boston Magazine clearly has a gift for fiction.\" He turned to the audience with an embarrassed sigh. \"And if I find which one of you provided that article, I\u0027ll have the consulate deport you.\"\n The crowd laughed.\n \"Well, folks, as you all know, I\u0027m here tonight to talk about the power of symbols ...\"\n The ringing of Langdon\u0027s hotel phone once again broke the silence.\n Groaning in disbelief, he picked up. \"Yes?\"\n As expected, it was the concierge. \"Mr. Langdon, again my apologies. I am calling to inform you that your guest is now en route to your room. I thought I should alert you.\"\n Langdon was wide awake now. \"You sent someone to my room?\"\n \"I apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... I cannot presume the authority to stop him.\" \"Who exactly is he?\" But the concierge was gone.\n Almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on Langdon\u0027s door.\n Uncertain, Langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. He donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. \"Who is it?\"\n \"Mr. Langdon? I need to speak with you.\" The man\u0027s English was accented - a sharp, authoritative bark. \"My name is Lieutenant Jerome Collet. Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire.\"\n Langdon paused. The Judicial Police? The DCPJ was the rough equivalent of the U. S. FBI.\n Leaving the security chain in place, Langdon opened the door a few inches. The face staring back at him was thin and washed out. The man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking blue uniform.\n \"May I come in?\" the agent asked.\n Langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger\u0027s sallow eyes studied him. \"What is this all about?\"\n \"My capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter.\" \"Now?\" Langdon managed. \"It\u0027s after midnight.\" \"Am I correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the Louvre this evening?\"\n Langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. He and the revered curator Jacques Sauniere had been slated to meet for drinks after Langdon\u0027s lecture tonight, but Sauniere had never shown up. \"Yes. How did you know that?\"\n \"We found your name in his daily planner.\"\n \"I trust nothing is wrong?\"\n The agent gave a dire sigh and slid a Polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door. When Langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.\" This photo was taken less than an hour ago. Inside the Louvre.\"\n As Langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden upwelling of anger. \"Who would do this!\"\n \"We had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in symbology and your plans to meet with him.\"\n Langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. The image was gruesome and profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of deja vu. A little over a year ago, Langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. Twenty-four hours later, he had almost lost his life inside Vatican City. This photo was entirely different, and yet something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.\n The agent checked his watch. \"My capitaine is waiting, sir.\"\n Langdon barely heard him. His eyes were still riveted on the picture. \"This symbol here, and the way his body is so oddly...\"\n \"Positioned?\" the agent offered.\n Langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. \"I can\u0027t imagine who would do this to someone.\"\n The agent looked grim. \"You don\u0027t understand, Mr. Langdon. What you see in this photograph...\" He paused. \"Monsieur Sauniere did that to himself.\"\n CHAPTER 2\n One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brownstone residence on Rue La Bruyere. The spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the Lord.\n Pain is good.\n His red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. Empty. He climbed the stairs quietly, not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. His bedroom door was open; locks were forbidden here. He entered, closing the door behind him.\n The room was spartan - hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as his bed. He was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar sanctuary in New York City.\n The Lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.\n Tonight, at last, Silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. Hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.\n \"Yes?\" a male voice answered. \"Teacher, I have returned.\" \"Speak,\" the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.\n \"All four are gone. The three senechaux...and the Grand Master himself.\"\n There was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. \"Then I assume you have the information?\" \"All four concurred. Independently.\" \"And you believed them?\"\n \"Their agreement was too great for coincidence.\"\n An excited breath. \"Excellent. I had feared the brotherhood\u0027s reputation for secrecy might prevail.\" \"The prospect of death is strong motivation.\" \"So, my pupil, tell me what I must know.\"\n Silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. \"Teacher, all four confirmed the existence of the clef de voute...the legendary keystone.\"\n He heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the Teacher\u0027s excitement. \"The keystone.Exactly as we suspected.\"\n According to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone - a clef de voute...or keystone - an engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood\u0027s greatest secret... information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood\u0027s very existence. \"When we possess the keystone,\" the Teacher said,\" we will be only one step away.\" \"We are closer than you think. The keystone is here in Paris.\" \"Paris? Incredible. It is almost too easy.\" Silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death, had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. Each had told Silas the exact same thing - that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of Paris\u0027s ancient churches - the Eglise de Saint-Sulpice.\n \"Inside a house of the Lord,\" the Teacher exclaimed. \"How they mock us!\" \"As they have for centuries.\" The Teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. Finally, he spoke. \"You have done a great service to God. We have waited centuries for this. You must retrieve the stone for me. Immediately. Tonight. You understand the stakes.\"\n Silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the Teacher was now commanding seemed impossible. \"But the church, it is a fortress. Especially at night. How will I enter?\"\n With the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the Teacher explained what was to be done.\n When Silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.\n One hour, he told himself, grateful that the Teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary penance before entering a house of God. I must purge my soul of today\u0027s sins.The sins committed today had been holy in purpose. Acts of war against the enemies of God had been committed for centuries. Forgiveness was assured.\n Even so, Silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.\n Pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. Looking down, he examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. All true followers of The Way wore this device - a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual reminder of Christ\u0027s suffering. The pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of the flesh.\n Although Silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew today was no ordinary day. Grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the barbs dug deeper into his flesh. Exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.\n Pain is good, Silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of Father Josemaria Escriva - the Teacher of all Teachers. Although Escriva had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still whispered by thousands of faithful servants around the globe as they knelt on the floor and performed the sacred practice known as\" corporal mortification.\"\n Silas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on the floor beside him. TheDiscipline. The knots were caked with dried blood. Eager for the purifying effects of his own agony, Silas said a quick prayer. Then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. He whipped it over his shoulder again, slashing at his flesh. Again and again, he lashed.\n Castigo corpus meum.\n Finally, he felt the blood begin to flow.\n CHAPTER 3\n The crisp April air whipped through the open window of the Citroen ZX as it skimmed south past the Opera House and crossed Place Vend\u0026ocirc;me. In the passenger seat, Robert Langdon felt the city tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. His quick shower and shave had left him looking reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. The frightening image of the curator\u0027s body remained locked in his mind.\n Jacques Sauniere is dead.\n Langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator\u0027s death. Despite Sauniere\u0027s reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to revere. His books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of Poussin and Teniers were some of Langdon\u0027s favorite classroom texts. Tonight\u0027s meeting had been one Langdon was very much looking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.\n Again the image of the curator\u0027s body flashed in his mind. Jacques Sauniere did that to himself?Langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.\n Outside, the city was just now winding down - street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes, waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a breeze scented with jasmine blossom. The Citroen navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.\n \"Le capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in Paris tonight,\" the agent said, speaking for the first time since they\u0027d left the hotel. \"A fortunate coincidence.\"\n Langdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he did not entirely trust. As someone who had spent his life exploring the hidden interconnectivity of disparate emblems and ideologies, Langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories and events. The connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at Harvard, but they are always there, buried just beneath the surface.\n \"I assume,\" Langdon said,\" that the American University of Paris told you where I was staying?\" The driver shook his head. \"Interpol.\" Interpol, Langdon thought. Of course.He had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous request of all European hotels to see a passport at check-in was more than a quaint formality - it was the law. On any given night, all across Europe, Interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping where. Finding Langdon at the Ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.\n As the Citroen accelerated southward across the city, the illuminated profile of the Eiffel Tower appeared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. Seeing it, Langdon thought of Vittoria, recalling their playful promise a year ago that every six months they would meet again at a different romantic spot on the globe. The Eiffel Tower, Langdon suspected, would have made their list. Sadly, he last kissed Vittoria in a noisy airport in Rome more than a year ago.\n \"Did you mount her?\" the agent asked, looking over.\n Langdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"She is lovely, no?\" The agent motioned through the windshield toward the Eiffel Tower. \"Have you mounted her?\"\n Langdon rolled his eyes. \"No, I haven\u0027t climbed the tower.\" \"She is the symbol of France. I think she is perfect.\" Langdon nodded absently. Symbologists often remarked that France - a country renowned for machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure leaders like Napoleon and Pepin the Short - could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than a thousand-foot phallus.\n When they reached the intersection at Rue de Rivoli, the traffic light was red, but the Citroen didn\u0027t slow. The agent gunned the sedan across the junction and sped onto a wooded section of Rue Castiglione, which served as the northern entrance to the famed Tuileries Gardens - Paris\u0027s own version of Central Park. Most tourists mistranslated Jardins des Tuileries as relating to the thousands of tulips that bloomed here, but Tuileries was actually a literal reference to something far less romantic. This park had once been an enormous, polluted excavation pit from which Parisian contractors mined clay to manufacture the city\u0027s famous red roofing tiles - or tuiles.\n As they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turned off the blaring siren. Langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. Outside the car, the pale wash of halogen headlights skimmed over the crushed gravel parkway, the rugged whir of the tires intoning a hypnotic rhythm. Langdon had always considered the Tuileries to be sacred ground. These were the gardens in which Claude Monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the Impressionist movement. Tonight, however, this place held a strange aura of foreboding.\n The Citroen swerved left now, angling west down the park\u0027s central boulevard. Curling around a circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out into a wide quadrangle beyond. Langdon could now see the end of the Tuileries Gardens, marked by a giant stone archway.\n Arc du Carrousel.\n Despite the orgiastic rituals once held at the Arc du Carrousel, art aficionados revered this place for another reason entirely. From the esplanade at the end of the Tuileries, four of the finest art museums in the world could be seen... one at each point of the compass.\n Out the right-hand window, south across the Seine and Quai Voltaire, Langdon could see the dramatically lit facade of the old train station - now the esteemed Musee d\u0027Orsay. Glancing left, he could make out the top of the ultramodern Pompidou Center, which housed the Museum of Modern Art. Behind him to the west, Langdon knew the ancient obelisk of Ramses rose above the trees, marking the Musee du Jeu de Paume.\n But it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that Langdon could now see the monolithic Renaissance palace that had become the most famous art museum in the world.\n Musee du Louvre.\n Langdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt to absorb the entire mass of the edifice. Across a staggeringly expansive plaza, the imposing facade of the Louvre rose like a citadel against the Paris sky. Shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the Louvre was the longest building in Europe, stretching farther than three Eiffel Towers laid end to end. Not even the million square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could challenge the majesty of the facade\u0027s breadth. Langdon had once walked the Louvre\u0027s entire perimeter, an astonishing three-mile journey.\n Despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65, 300 pieces of art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience Langdon referred to as \"Louvre Lite\" - a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: the Mona Lisa, Venus de Milo, and Winged Victory.Art Buchwald had once boasted he\u0027d seen all three masterpieces in five minutes and fifty-six seconds.\n The driver pulled out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire French. \"Monsieur Langdonest arrive.Deux minutes.\"\n An indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.\n The agent stowed the device, turning now to Langdon. \"You will meet the capitaine at the main entrance.\"\n The driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved the engine, and gunned the Citroen up over the curb. The Louvre\u0027s main entrance was visible now, rising boldly in the distance, encircled by seven triangular pools from which spouted illuminated fountains.\n La Pyramide.\n The new entrance to the Paris Louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself. The controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by Chinese-born American architect I. M. Peistill evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the Renaissance courtyard. Goethe had described architecture as frozen music, and Pei\u0027s critics described this pyramid as fingernails on a chalkboard. Progressive admirers, though, hailed Pei\u0027s seventy-one-foot-tall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method - a symbolic link between the old and new - helping usher the Louvre into the next millennium.\n \"Do you like our pyramid?\" the agent asked.\n Langdon frowned. The French, it seemed, loved to ask Americans this. It was a loaded question, of course. Admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tasteless American, and expressing dislike was an insult to the French.\n \"Mitterrand was a bold man,\" Langdon replied, splitting the difference. The late French president who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a\" Pharaoh complex.\" Singlehandedly responsible for filling Paris with Egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts.\n Fran\u0026ccedil;ois Mitterrand had an affinity for Egyptian culture that was so all-consuming that the French still referred to him as the Sphinx.\n \"What is the captain\u0027s name?\" Langdon asked, changing topics.\n \"Bezu Fache,\" the driver said, approaching the pyramid\u0027s main entrance. \"We call him le Taureau.\"\n Langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every Frenchman had a mysterious animal epithet. \"You call your captain the Bull?\"\n The man arched his eyebrows. \"Your French is better than you admit, Monsieur Langdon.\"\n My French stinks, Langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good.Taurus was always the bull. Astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.\n The agent pulled the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a large door in the side of the pyramid. \"There is the entrance. Good luck, monsieur.\" \"You\u0027re not coming?\" \"My orders are to leave you here. I have other business to attend to.\" Langdon heaved a sigh and climbed out. It\u0027s your circus. The agent revved his engine and sped off.\n As Langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized he could easily reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. Something told him it was probably a lousy idea.\n As he moved toward the mist of the fountains, Langdon had the uneasy sense he was crossing an imaginary threshold into another world. The dreamlike quality of the evening was settling around him again. Twenty minutes ago he had been asleep in his hotel room. Now he was standing in front of a transparent pyramid built by the Sphinx, waiting for a policeman they called the Bull.\n I\u0027m trapped in a Salvador Dali painting, he thought.\n Langdon strode to the main entrance - an enormous revolving door. The foyer beyond was dimly lit and deserted.\n Do I knock?\n Langdon wondered if any of Harvard\u0027s revered Egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of a pyramid and expected an answer. He raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. The man was stocky and dark, almost Neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. He advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. He was speaking on his cell phone but finished the call as he arrived. He motioned for Langdon to enter.\n \"I am Bezu Fache,\" he announced as Langdon pushed through the revolving door. \"Captain of the Central Directorate Judicial Police.\" His tone was fitting - a guttural rumble... like a gathering storm.\n Langdon held out his hand to shake. \"Robert Langdon.\"\n Fache\u0027s enormous palm wrapped around Langdon\u0027s with crushing force.\n \"I saw the photo,\" Langdon said. \"Your agent said Jacques Sauniere himself did - \"\n \"Mr. Langdon,\" Fache\u0027s ebony eyes locked on. \"What you see in the photo is only the beginning of what Sauniere did.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-3.html","bookId":2227,"book":{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: \n While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum.
