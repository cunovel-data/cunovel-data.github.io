{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci-clues visible for all to see-yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion-an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory\u0027s ancient secret-and an explosive historical truth-will be lost forever. The Da Vinci Code heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightning-paced, intelligent thriller... utterly unpredictable right up to its stunning conclusion.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2.jpg","author":"Dan Brown","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":32,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
