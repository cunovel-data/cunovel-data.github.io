{"id":107211,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"CHAPTER 13\n For several seconds, Langdon stared in wonder at the photograph of Sauniere\u0027s postscript. P. S. Find Robert Langdon.He felt as if the floor were tilting beneath his feet. Sauniere left a postscript with my name on it? In his wildest dreams, Langdon could not fathom why.\n \"Now do you understand,\" Sophie said, her eyes urgent,\" why Fache ordered you here tonight, and why you are his primary suspect?\"\n The only thing Langdon understood at the moment was why Fache had looked so smug when Langdon suggested Sauniere would have accused his killer by name.\n Find Robert Langdon.\n \"Why would Sauniere write this?\" Langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger. \"Why would I want to kill Jacques Sauniere?\"\n \"Fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entire conversation with you tonight in hopes you might reveal one.\"\n Langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.\n \"He\u0027s fitted with a miniature microphone,\" Sophie explained. \"It\u0027s connected to a transmitter in his pocket that radios the signal back to the command post.\"\n \"This is impossible,\" Langdon stammered. \"I have an alibi. I went directly back to my hotel after my lecture. You can ask the hotel desk.\"\n \"Fache already did. His report shows you retrieving your room key from the concierge at about ten- thirty. Unfortunately, the time of the murder was closer to eleven. You easily could have left your hotel room unseen.\"\n \"This is insanity! Fache has no evidence!\"\n Sophie\u0027s eyes widened as if to say: No evidence?\" Mr. Langdon, your name is written on the floor beside the body, and Sauniere\u0027s date book says you were with him at approximately the time of the murder.\" She paused. \"Fache has more than enough evidence to take you into custody for questioning.\"\n Langdon suddenly sensed that he needed a lawyer. \"I didn\u0027t do this.\"\n Sophie sighed. \"This is not American television, Mr. Langdon. In France, the laws protect the police, not criminals. Unfortunately, in this case, there is also the media consideration. Jacques Sauniere was a very prominent and well-loved figure in Paris, and his murder will be news in the morning. Fache will be under immediate pressure to make a statement, and he looks a lot better having a suspect in custody already. Whether or not you are guilty, you most certainly will be held by DCPJ until they can figure out what really happened.\"\n Langdon felt like a caged animal. \"Why are you telling me all this?\"\n \"Because, Mr. Langdon, I believe you are innocent.\" Sophie looked away for a moment and then back into his eyes. \"And also because it is partially my fault that you\u0027re in trouble.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry? It\u0027s your fault Sauniere is trying to frame me?\"\n \"Sauniere wasn\u0027t trying to frame you. It was a mistake. That message on the floor was meant for me.\"\n Langdon needed a minute to process that one. \"I beg your pardon?\"\n \"That message wasn\u0027t for the police. He wrote it for me.I think he was forced to do everything in such a hurry that he just didn\u0027t realize how it would look to the police.\" She paused. \"The numbered code is meaningless. Sauniere wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers, ensuring that I would know as soon as possible what had happened to him.\"\n Langdon felt himself losing touch fast. Whether or not Sophie Neveu had lost her mind was at this point up for grabs, but at least Langdon now understood why she was trying to help him. P. S.Find Robert Langdon.She apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to find Langdon. \"But why do you think his message was for you?\"\n \"The Vitruvian Man,\"she said flatly. \"That particular sketch has always been my favorite Da Vinci work. Tonight he used it to catch my attention.\"\n \"Hold on. You\u0027re saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?\" She nodded. \"I\u0027m sorry. This is all coming out of order. Jacques Sauniere and I...\"\n Sophie\u0027s voice caught, and Langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painful past, simmering just below the surface. Sophie and Jacques Sauniere apparently had some kind of special relationship. Langdon studied the beautiful young woman before him, well aware that aging men in France often took young mistresses. Even so, Sophie Neveu as a\" kept woman\" somehow didn\u0027t seem to fit.\n \"We had a falling-out ten years ago,\" Sophie said, her voice a whisper now. \"We\u0027ve barely spoken since. Tonight, when Crypto got the call that he had been murdered, and I saw the images of his body and text on the floor, I realized he was trying to send me a message.\" \"Because of The Vitruvian Man?\" \"Yes. And the letters P. S.\"\n \"Post Script?\"\n She shook her head. \"P. S. are my initials.\" \"But your name is Sophie Neveu.\" She looked away. \"P. S. is the nickname he called me when I lived with him.\" She blushed. \"It stood for Princesse Sophie\"\n Langdon had no response.\n \"Silly, I know,\" she said. \"But it was years ago. When I was a little girl.\" \"You knew him when you were a little girl?\" \"Quite well,\" she said, her eyes welling now with emotion. \"Jacques Sauniere was my grandfather.\"\n CHAPTER 14\n \"Where\u0027s Langdon?\" Fache demanded, exhaling the last of a cigarette as he paced back into the command post.\n \"Still in the men\u0027s room, sir.\" Lieutenant Collet had been expecting the question. Fache grumbled,\" Taking his time, I see.\" The captain eyed the GPS dot over Collet\u0027s shoulder, and Collet could almost hear the wheels turning. Fache was fighting the urge to go check on Langdon. Ideally, the subject of an observation was allowed the most time and freedom possible, lulling him into a false sense of security. Langdon needed to return of his own volition. Still, it had been almost ten minutes.\n Too long.\n \"Any chance Langdon is onto us?\" Fache asked.\n Collet shook his head. \"We\u0027re still seeing small movements inside the men\u0027s room, so the GPS dot is obviously still on him. Perhaps he feels ill? If he had found the dot, he would have removed it and tried to run.\"\n Fache checked his watch. \"Fine.\"\n Still Fache seemed preoccupied. All evening, Collet had sensed an atypical intensity in his captain.\n Usually detached and cool under pressure, Fache tonight seemed emotionally engaged, as if this were somehow a personal matter for him.\n Not surprising, Collet thought. Fache needs this arrest desperately.Recently the Board of Ministers and the media had become more openly critical of Fache\u0027s aggressive tactics, his clashes with powerful foreign embassies, and his gross over budgeting on new technologies. Tonight, a high-tech, high-profile arrest of an American would go a long way to silence Fache\u0027s critics, helping him secure the job a few more years until he could retire with the lucrative pension. God knows he needs the pension, Collet thought. Fache\u0027s zeal for technology had hurt him both professionally and personally. Fache was rumored to have invested his entire savings in the technology craze a few years back and lost his shirt. And Fache is a man who wears only the finest shirts.\n Tonight, there was still plenty of time. Sophie Neveu\u0027s odd interruption, though unfortunate, had been only a minor wrinkle. She was gone now, and Fache still had cards to play. He had yet to inform Langdon that his name had been scrawled on the floor by the victim. P. S.Find Robert Langdon.The American\u0027s reaction to that little bit of evidence would be telling indeed.\n \"Captain?\" one of the DCPJ agents now called from across the office. \"I think you better take this call.\" He was holding out a telephone receiver, looking concerned.\n \"Who is it?\" Fache said.\n The agent frowned. \"It\u0027s the director of our Cryptology Department.\" \"And?\" \"It\u0027s about Sophie Neveu, sir. Something is not quite right.\"\n CHAPTER 15\n It was time.\n Silas felt strong as he stepped from the black Audi, the nighttime breeze rustling his loose-fitting robe. The winds of change are in the air.He knew the task before him would require more finesse than force, and he left his handgun in the car. The thirteen-round Heckler Koch USP 40 had been provided by the Teacher.\n A weapon of death has no place in a house of God.\n The plaza before the great church was deserted at this hour, the only visible souls on the far side of Place Saint-Sulpice a couple of teenage hookers showing their wares to the late night tourist traffic. Their nubile bodies sent a familiar longing to Silas\u0027s loins. His thigh flexed instinctively, causing the barbed cilice belt to cut painfully into his flesh.\n The lust evaporated instantly. For ten years now, Silas had faithfully denied himself all sexual indulgence, even self-administered. It was The Way.He knew he had sacrificed much to follow Opus Dei, but he had received much more in return. A vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice. Considering the poverty from which he had come and the sexual horrors he had endured in prison, celibacy was a welcome change.\n Now, having returned to France for the first time since being arrested and shipped to prison in Andorra, Silas could feel his homeland testing him, dragging violent memories from his redeemed soul. You have been reborn, he reminded himself. His service to God today had required the sin of murder, and it was a sacrifice Silas knew he would have to hold silently in his heart for all eternity.\n The measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure, the Teacher had told him. Silas was no stranger to pain and felt eager to prove himself to the Teacher, the one who had assured him his actions were ordained by a higher power.\n \"Hago la obra de Dios,\"Silas whispered, moving now toward the church entrance.\n Pausing in the shadow of the massive doorway, he took a deep breath. It was not until this instant that he truly realized what he was about to do, and what awaited him inside.\n The keystone. It will lead us to our final goal.\n He raised his ghost-white fist and banged three times on the door. Moments later, the bolts of the enormous wooden portal began to move.\n CHAPTER 16\n Sophie wondered how long it would take Fache to figure out she had not left the building. Seeing that Langdon was clearly overwhelmed, Sophie questioned whether she had done the right thing by cornering him here in the men\u0027s room.\n What else was I supposed to do?\n She pictured her grandfather\u0027s body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor. There was a time when he had meant the world to her, yet tonight, Sophie was surprised to feel almost no sadness for the man. Jacques Sauniere was a stranger to her now. Their relationship had evaporated in a single instant one March night when she was twenty-two. Ten years ago.Sophie had come home a few days early from graduate university in England and mistakenly witnessed her grandfather engaged in something Sophie was obviously not supposed to see. It was an image she barely could believe to this day.\n If I hadn\u0027t seen it with my own eyes...\n Too ashamed and stunned to endure her grandfather\u0027s pained attempts to explain, Sophie immediately moved out on her own, taking money she had saved, and getting a small flat with some roommates. She vowed never to speak to anyone about what she had seen. Her grandfather tried desperately to reach her, sending cards and letters, begging Sophie to meet him so he could explain. Explain how!? Sophie never responded except once - to forbid him ever to call her or try to meet her in public. She was afraid his explanation would be more terrifying than the incident itself.\n Incredibly, Sauniere had never given up on her, and Sophie now possessed a decade\u0027s worth of correspondence unopened in a dresser drawer. To her grandfather\u0027s credit, he had never once disobeyed her request and phoned her.\n Until this afternoon.\n \"Sophie?\" His voice had sounded startlingly old on her answering machine. \"I have abided by your wishes for so long... and it pains me to call, but I must speak to you. Something terrible has happened.\"\n Standing in the kitchen of her Paris flat, Sophie felt a chill to hear him again after all these years. His gentle voice brought back a flood of fond childhood memories.\n \"Sophie, please listen.\" He was speaking English to her, as he always did when she was a little girl. Practice French at school.Practice English at home. \"You cannot be mad forever. Have you not read the letters that I\u0027ve sent all these years? Do you not yet understand?\" He paused. \"We must speak at once. Please grant your grandfather this one wish. Call me at the Louvre. Right away. I believe you and I are in grave danger.\" Sophie stared at the answering machine. Danger? What was he talking about?\n \"Princess...\" Her grandfather\u0027s voice cracked with an emotion Sophie could not place. \"I know I\u0027ve kept things from you, and I know it has cost me your love. But it was for your own safety. Now you must know the truth. Please, I must tell you the truth about your family.\"\n Sophie suddenly could hear her own heart. My family? Sophie\u0027s parents had died when she was only four. Their car went off a bridge into fast-moving water. Her grandmother and younger brother had also been in the car, and Sophie\u0027s entire family had been erased in an instant. She had a box of newspaper clippings to confirm it.\n His words had sent an unexpected surge of longing through her bones. My family! In that fleeting instant, Sophie saw images from the dream that had awoken her countless times when she was a little girl: My family is alive! They are coming home! But, as in her dream, the pictures evaporated into oblivion.\n Your family is dead, Sophie. They are not coming home.\n \"Sophie...\" her grandfather said on the machine. \"I have been waiting for years to tell you. Waiting for the right moment, but now time has run out. Call me at the Louvre. As soon as you get this. I\u0027ll wait here all night. I fear we both may be in danger. There\u0027s so much you need to know.\"\n The message ended.\n In the silence, Sophie stood trembling for what felt like minutes. As she considered her grandfather\u0027s message, only one possibility made sense, and his true intent dawned.\n It was bait.\n Obviously, her grandfather wanted desperately to see her. He was trying anything. Her disgust for the man deepened. Sophie wondered if maybe he had fallen terminally ill and had decided to attempt any ploy he could think of to get Sophie to visit him one last time. If so, he had chosen wisely.\n My family.\n Now, standing in the darkness of the Louvre men\u0027s room, Sophie could hear the echoes of this afternoon\u0027s phone message. Sophie, we both may be in danger.Call me.\n She had not called him. Nor had she planned to. Now, however, her skepticism had been deeply challenged. Her grandfather lay murdered inside his own museum. And he had written a code on the floor.\n A code for her.Of this, she was certain.\n Despite not understanding the meaning of his message, Sophie was certain its cryptic nature was additional proof that the words were intended for her. Sophie\u0027s passion and aptitude for cryptography were a product of growing up with Jacques Sauniere - a fanatic himself for codes, word games, and puzzles. How many Sundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords in the newspaper?\n At the age of twelve, Sophie could finish the Le Monde crossword without any help, and her grandfather graduated her to crosswords in English, mathematical puzzles, and substitution ciphers. Sophie devoured them all. Eventually she turned her passion into a profession by becoming a code breaker for the Judicial Police.\n Tonight, the cryptographer in Sophie was forced to respect the efficiency with which her grandfather had used a simple code to unite two total strangers - Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdon.\n The question was why?\n Unfortunately, from the bewildered look in Langdon\u0027s eyes, Sophie sensed the American had no more idea than she did why her grandfather had thrown them together.\n She pressed again. \"You and my grandfather had planned to meet tonight. What about?\"\n Langdon looked truly perplexed. \"His secretary set the meeting and didn\u0027t offer any specific reason, and I didn\u0027t ask. I assumed he\u0027d heard I would be lecturing on the pagan iconography of French cathedrals, was interested in the topic, and thought it would be fun to meet for drinks after the talk.\"\n Sophie didn\u0027t buy it. The connection was flimsy. Her grandfather knew more about pagan iconography than anyone else on earth. Moreover, he an exceptionally private man, not someone prone to chatting with random American professors unless there were an important reason.\n Sophie took a deep breath and probed further. \"My grandfather called me this afternoon and told me he and I were in grave danger. Does that mean anything to you?\" Langdon\u0027s blue eyes now clouded with concern. \"No, but considering what just happened...\" Sophie nodded. Considering tonight\u0027s events, she would be a fool not to be frightened. Feeling drained, she walked to the small plate-glass window at the far end of the bathroom and gazed out in silence through the mesh of alarm tape embedded in the glass. They were high up - forty feet at least.\n Sighing, she raised her eyes and gazed out at Paris\u0027s dazzling landscape. On her left, across the Seine, the illuminated Eiffel Tower. Straight ahead, the Arc de Triomphe. And to the right, high atop the sloping rise of Montmartre, the graceful arabesque dome of Sacre-Coeur, its polished stone glowing white like a resplendent sanctuary.\n Here at the westernmost tip of the Denon Wing, the north-south thoroughfare of Place du Carrousel ran almost flush with the building with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the Louvre\u0027s outer wall. Far below, the usual caravan of the city\u0027s nighttime delivery trucks sat idling, waiting for the signals to change, their running lights seeming to twinkle mockingly up at Sophie.\n \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Langdon said, coming up behind her. \"Your grandfather is obviously trying to tell us something. I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m so little help.\"\n Sophie turned from the window, sensing a sincere regret in Langdon\u0027s deep voice. Even with all the trouble around him, he obviously wanted to help her. The teacher in him, she thought, having read DCPJ\u0027s workup on their suspect. This was an academic who clearly despised not understanding.\n We have that in common, she thought.\n As a code breaker, Sophie made her living extracting meaning from seemingly senseless data. Tonight, her best guess was that Robert Langdon, whether he knew it or not, possessed information that she desperately needed. Princesse Sophie, Find Robert Langdon.How much clearer could her grandfather\u0027s message be? Sophie needed more time with Langdon. Time to think. Time to sort out this mystery together. Unfortunately, time was running out.\n Gazing up at Langdon, Sophie made the only play she could think of. \"Bezu Fache will be taking you into custody at any minute. I can get you out of this museum. But we need to act now.\" Langdon\u0027s eyes went wide. \"You want me to run?\" \"It\u0027s the smartest thing you could do. If you let Fache take you into custody now, you\u0027ll spend weeks in a French jail while DCPJ and the U. S. Embassy fight over which courts try your case. But if we get you out of here, and make it to your embassy, then your government will protect your rights while you and I prove you had nothing to do with this murder.\"\n Langdon looked not even vaguely convinced. \"Forget it! Fache has armed guards on every single exit! Even if we escape without being shot, running away only makes me look guilty. You need to tell Fache that the message on the floor was for you, and that my name is not there as an accusation.\"\n \"I will do that,\" Sophie said, speaking hurriedly,\" but after you\u0027re safely inside the U. S. Embassy. It\u0027s only about a mile from here, and my car is parked just outside the museum. Dealing with Fache from here is too much of a gamble. Don\u0027t you see? Fache has made it his mission tonight to prove you are guilty. The only reason he postponed your arrest was to run this observance in hopes you did something that made his case stronger.\" \"Exactly. Like running!\" The cell phone in Sophie\u0027s sweater pocket suddenly began ringing. Fache probably.She reached in her sweater and turned off the phone.\n \"Mr. Langdon,\" she said hurriedly,\" I need to ask you one last question.\" And your entire future may depend on it. \"The writing on the floor is obviously not proof of your guilt, and yet Fache told our team he is certain you are his man. Can you think of any other reason he might be convinced you\u0027re guilty?\"\n Langdon was silent for several seconds. \"None whatsoever.\"\n Sophie sighed. Which means Fache is lying.Why, Sophie could not begin to imagine, but that was hardly the issue at this point. The fact remained that Bezu Fache was determined to put Robert Langdon behind bars tonight, at any cost. Sophie needed Langdon for herself, and it was this dilemma that left Sophie only one logical conclusion.\n I need to get Langdon to the U. S. Embassy.\n Turning toward the window, Sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass, down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. A leap from this height would leave Langdon with a couple of broken legs. At best.\n Nonetheless, Sophie made her decision.\n Robert Langdon was about to escape the Louvre, whether he wanted to or not.\n CHAPTER 17\n \"What do you mean she\u0027s not answering?\" Fache looked incredulous. \"You\u0027re calling her cell phone, right? I know she\u0027s carrying it.\"\n Collet had been trying to reach Sophie now for several minutes. \"Maybe her batteries are dead. Or her ringer\u0027s off.\"\n Fache had looked distressed ever since talking to the director of Cryptology on the phone. After hanging up, he had marched over to Collet and demanded he get Agent Neveu on the line. Now Collet had failed, and Fache was pacing like a caged lion.\n \"Why did Crypto call?\" Collet now ventured.\n Fache turned. \"To tell us they found no references to Draconian devils and lame saints.\" \"That\u0027s all?\" \"No, also to tell us that they had just identified the numerics as Fibonacci numbers, but they suspected the series was meaningless.\"\n Collet was confused. \"But they already sent Agent Neveu to tell us that.\" Fache shook his head. \"They didn\u0027t send Neveu.\" \"What?\"\n \"According to the director, at my orders he paged his entire team to look at the images I\u0027d wired him. When Agent Neveu arrived, she took one look at the photos of Sauniere and the code and left the office without a word. The director said he didn\u0027t question her behavior because she was understandably upset by the photos.\"\n \"Upset? She\u0027s never seen a picture of a dead body?\"\n Fache was silent a moment. \"I was not aware of this, and it seems neither was the director until a coworker informed him, but apparently Sophie Neveu is Jacques Sauniere\u0027s granddaughter.\"\n Collet was speechless.\n \"The director said she never once mentioned Sauniere to him, and he assumed it was because she probably didn\u0027t want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather.\"\n No wonder she was upset by the pictures.Collet could barely conceive of the unfortunate coincidence that called in a young woman to decipher a code written by a dead family member. Still, her actions made no sense. \"But she obviously recognized the numbers as Fibonacci numbers because she came here and told us. I don\u0027t understand why she would leave the office without telling anyone she had figured it out.\"\n Collet could think of only one scenario to explain the troubling developments: Sauniere had written a numeric code on the floor in hopes Fache would involve cryptographers in the investigation, and therefore involve his own granddaughter. As for the rest of the message, was Saunie recommunicating in some way with his granddaughter? If so, what did the message tell her? And how did Langdon fit in?\n Before Collet could ponder it any further, the silence of the deserted museum was shattered by an alarm. The bell sounded like it was coming from inside the Grand Gallery.\n \"Alarme!\" one of the agents yelled, eyeing his feed from the Louvre security center. \"GrandeGalerie! Toilettes Messieurs!\"\n Fache wheeled to Collet. \"Where\u0027s Langdon?\"\n \"Still in the men\u0027s room!\" Collet pointed to the blinking red dot on his laptop schematic. \"He must have broken the window!\" Collet knew Langdon wouldn\u0027t get far. Although Paris fire codes required windows above fifteen meters in public buildings be breakable in case of fire, exiting a Louvre second-story window without the help of a hook and ladder would be suicide. Furthermore, there were no trees or grass on the western end of the Denon Wing to cushion a fall. Directly beneath that rest room window, the two-lane Place du Carrousel ran within a few feet of the outer wall. \"My God,\" Collet exclaimed, eyeing the screen. \"Langdon\u0027s moving to the window ledge!\"\n But Fache was already in motion. Yanking his Manurhin MR-93 revolver from his shoulder holster, the captain dashed out of the office.\n Collet watched the screen in bewilderment as the blinking dot arrived at the window ledge and then did something utterly unexpected. The dot moved outside the perimeter of the building.\n What\u0027s going on? he wondered. Is Langdon out on a ledge or -\n \"Jesu!\" Collet jumped to his feet as the dot shot farther outside the wall. The signal seemed to shudder for a moment, and then the blinking dot came to an abrupt stop about ten yards outside the perimeter of the building.\n Fumbling with the controls, Collet called up a Paris street map and recalibrated the GPS. Zooming in, he could now see the exact location of the signal.\n It was no longer moving.\n It lay at a dead stop in the middle of Place du Carrousel. Langdon had jumped. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-7.html","bookId":2227,"book":{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: \n While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum.
