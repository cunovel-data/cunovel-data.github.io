{"id":107226,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"CHAPTER 73 Bourget Airfield\u0027s night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before a blank radar screen when the captain of the Judicial Police practically broke down his door. \"Teabing\u0027s jet,\" Bezu Fache blared, marching into the small tower,\" where did it go?\" The controller\u0027s initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect the privacy of their British client - one of the airfield\u0027s most respected customers. It failed miserably. \"Okay,\" Fache said,\" I am placing you under arrest for permitting a private plane to take off without registering a flight plan.\" Fache motioned to another officer, who approached with handcuffs, and the traffic controller felt a surge of terror. He thought of the newspaper articles debating whether the nation\u0027s police captain was a hero or a menace. That question had just been answered. \"Wait!\" the controller heard himself whimper at the sight of the handcuffs. \"I can tell you this much. Sir Leigh Teabing makes frequent trips to London for medical treatments. He has a hangar at Biggin Hill Executive Airport in Kent. On the outskirts of London.\" Fache waved off the man with the cuffs. \"Is Biggin Hill his destination tonight?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" the controller said honestly. \"The plane left on its usual tack, and his last radar contact suggested the United Kingdom. Biggin Hill is an extremely likely guess.\" \"Did he have others onboard?\" \"I swear, sir, there is no way for me to know that. Our clients can drive directly to their hangars, and load as they please. Who is onboard is the responsibility of the customs officials at the receiving airport.\" Fache checked his watch and gazed out at the scattering of jets parked in front of the terminal. \"If they\u0027re going to Biggin Hill, how long until they land?\" The controller fumbled through his records. \"It\u0027s a short flight. His plane could be on the ground by... around six-thirty. Fifteen minutes from now.\" Fache frowned and turned to one of his men. \"Get a transport up here. I\u0027m going to London. And get me the Kent local police. Not British MI5. I want this quiet. Kent local.Tell them I want Teabing\u0027s plane to be permitted to land. Then I want it surrounded on the tarmac. Nobody deplanes until I get there.\" CHAPTER 74 \"You\u0027re quiet,\" Langdon said, gazing across the Hawker\u0027s cabin at Sophie. \"Just tired,\" she replied. \"And the poem. I don\u0027t know.\" Langdon was feeling the same way. The hum of the engines and the gentle rocking of the plane were hypnotic, and his head still throbbed where he\u0027d been hit by the monk. Teabing was still in the back of the plane, and Langdon decided to take advantage of the moment alone with Sophie to tell her something that had been on his mind. \"I think I know part of the reason why your grandfather conspired to put us together. I think there\u0027s something he wanted me to explain to you.\" \"The history of the Holy Grail and Mary Magdalene isn\u0027t enough?\" Langdon felt uncertain how to proceed. \"The rift between you. The reason you haven\u0027t spoken to him in ten years. I think maybe he was hoping I could somehow make that right by explaining what drove you apart.\" Sophie squirmed in her seat. \"I haven\u0027t told you what drove us apart.\" Langdon eyed her carefully. \"You witnessed a sex rite. Didn\u0027t you?\" Sophie recoiled. \"How do you know that?\" \"Sophie, you told me you witnessed something that convinced you your grandfather was in a secret society. And whatever you saw upset you enough that you haven\u0027t spoken to him since. I know a fair amount about secret societies. It doesn\u0027t take the brains of Da Vinci to guess what you saw.\" Sophie stared. \"Was it in the spring?\" Langdon asked. \"Sometime around the equinox? Mid-March?\" Sophie looked out the window. \"I was on spring break from university. I came home a few days early.\" \"You want to tell me about it?\" \"I\u0027d rather not.\" She turned suddenly back to Langdon, her eyes welling with emotion. \"I don\u0027t know what I saw.\" \"Were both men and women present?\" After a beat, she nodded.\" Dressed in white and black?\" She wiped her eyes and then nodded, seeming to open up a little. \"The women were in white gossamer gowns... with golden shoes. They held golden orbs. The men wore black tunics and black shoes.\" Langdon strained to hide his emotion, and yet he could not believe what he was hearing. Sophie Neveu had unwittingly witnessed a two-thousand-year-old sacred ceremony. \"Masks?\" he asked, keeping his voice calm. \"Androgynous masks?\" \"Yes. Everyone. Identical masks. White on the women. Black on the men.\" Langdon had read descriptions of this ceremony and understood its mystic roots. \"It\u0027s called Hieros Gamos,\" he said softly. \"It dates back more than two thousand years. Egyptian priests and priestesses performed it regularly to celebrate the reproductive power of the female,\" He paused, leaning toward her. \"And if you witnessed Hieros Gamos without being properly prepared to understand its meaning, I imagine it would be pretty shocking.\" Sophie said nothing. \"Hieros Gamos is Greek,\" he continued. \"It means sacred marriage.\" \"The ritual I saw was no marriage.\" \"Marriage as in union, Sophie.\" \"You mean as in sex.\" \"No.\" \"No?\" she said, her olive eyes testing him. Langdon backpedaled. \"Well... yes, in a manner of speaking, but not as we understand it today.\" He explained that although what she saw probably looked like a sex ritual, Hieros Gamos had nothing to do with eroticism. It was a spiritual act. Historically, intercourse was the act through which male and female experienced God. The ancients believed that the male was spiritually incomplete until he had carnal knowledge of the sacred feminine. Physical union with the female remained the sole means through which man could become spiritually complete and ultimately achieve gnosis - knowledge of the divine. Since the days of Isis, sex rites had been considered man\u0027s only bridge from earth to heaven. \"By communing with woman,\" Langdon said,\" man could achieve a climactic instant when his mind went totally blank and he could see God.\" Sophie looked skeptical. \"Orgasm as prayer?\" Langdon gave a noncommittal shrug, although Sophie was essentially correct. Physiologically speaking, the male climax was accompanied by a split second entirely devoid of thought. A brief mental vacuum. A moment of clarity during which God could be glimpsed. Meditation gurus achieved similar states of thoughtlessness without sex and often described Nirvana as a never- ending spiritual orgasm. \"Sophie,\" Langdon said quietly,\" it\u0027s important to remember that the ancients\u0027 view of sex was entirely opposite from ours today. Sex begot new life - the ultimate miracle - and miracles could be performed only by a god. The ability of the woman to produce life from her womb made her sacred. A god. Intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit - male and female - through which the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with God. What you saw was not about sex, it was about spirituality. The Hieros Gamos ritual is not a perversion. It\u0027s a deeply sacrosanct ceremony.\" His words seemed to strike a nerve. Sophie had been remarkably poised all evening, but now, for the first time, Langdon saw the aura of composure beginning to crack. Tears materialized in her eyes again, and she dabbed them away with her sleeve. He gave her a moment. Admittedly, the concept of sex as a pathway to God was mind-boggling at first. Langdon\u0027s Jewish students always looked flabbergasted when he first told them that the early Jewish tradition involved ritualistic sex. In the Temple, no less.Early Jews believed that the Holy of Holies in Solomon\u0027s Temple housed not only God but also His powerful female equal, Shekinah. Men seeking spiritual wholeness came to the Temple to visit priestesses - or hierodules - with whom they made love and experienced the divine through physical union. The Jewish tetragrammaton YHWH - the sacred name of God - in fact derived from Jehovah, an androgynous physical union between the masculine Jah and the pre-Hebraic name for Eve, Havah. \"For the early Church,\" Langdon explained in a soft voice,\" mankind\u0027s use of sex to commune directly with God posed a serious threat to the Catholic power base. It left the Church out of the loop, undermining their self-proclaimed status as the sole conduit to God. For obvious reasons, they worked hard to demonize sex and recast it as a disgusting and sinful act. Other major religions did the same.\" Sophie was silent, but Langdon sensed she was starting to understand her grandfather better. Ironically, Langdon had made this same point in a class lecture earlier this semester. \"Is it surprising we feel conflicted about sex?\" he asked his students. \"Our ancient heritage and our very physiologies tell us sex is natural - a cherished route to spiritual fulfillment - and yet modern religion decries it as shameful, teaching us to fear our sexual desire as the hand of the devil.\" Langdon decided not to shock his students with the fact that more than a dozen secret societies around the world - many of them quite influential - still practiced sex rites and kept the ancient traditions alive. Tom Cruise\u0027s character in the film Eyes Wide Shut discovered this the hard way when he sneaked into a private gathering of ultraelite Manhattanites only to find himself witnessing Hieros Gamos. Sadly, the filmmakers had gotten most of the specifics wrong, but the basic gist was there - a secret society communing to celebrate the magic of sexual union. \"Professor Langdon?\" A male student in back raised his hand, sounding hopeful. \"Are you saying that instead of going to chapel, we should have more sex?\" Langdon chuckled, not about to take the bait. From what he\u0027d heard about Harvard parties, these kids were having more than enough sex. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, knowing he was on tender ground,\" might I offer a suggestion for all of you. Without being so bold as to condone premarital sex, and without being so naive as to think you\u0027re all chaste angels, I will give you this bit of advice about your sex lives.\" All the men in the audience leaned forward, listening intently. \"The next time you find yourself with a woman, look in your heart and see if you cannot approach sex as a mystical, spiritual act. Challenge yourself to find that spark of divinity that man can only achieve through union with the sacred feminine.\" The women smiled knowingly, nodding. The men exchanged dubious giggles and off-color jokes. Langdon sighed. College men were still boys. Sophie\u0027s forehead felt cold as she pressed it against the plane\u0027s window and stared blankly into the void, trying to process what Langdon had just told her. She felt a new regret well within her. Ten years.She pictured the stacks of unopened letters her grandfather had sent her. I will tell Robert everything.Without turning from the window, Sophie began to speak. Quietly. Fearfully. As she began to recount what had happened that night, she felt herself drifting back... alighting in the woods outside her grandfather\u0027s Normandy chateau... searching the deserted house in confusion... hearing the voices below her... and then finding the hidden door. She inched down the stone staircase, one step at a time, into that basement grotto. She could taste the earthy air. Cool and light. It was March. In the shadows of her hiding place on the staircase, she watched as the strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles. I\u0027m dreaming, Sophie told herself. This is a dream. What else could this be? The women and men were staggered, black, white, black, white. The women\u0027s beautiful gossamer gowns billowed as they raised in their right hands golden orbs and called out in unison,\" I was withyou in the beginning, in the dawn of all that is holy, I bore you from the womb before the start of day.\" The women lowered their orbs, and everyone rocked back and forth as if in a trance. They were revering something in the center of the circle. What are they looking at? The voices accelerated now. Louder. Faster. \"The woman whom you behold is love!\" The women called, raising their orbs again. The men responded,\" She has her dwelling in eternity!\" The chanting grew steady again. Accelerating. Thundering now. Faster. The participants stepped inward and knelt. In that instant, Sophie could finally see what they were all watching. On a low, ornate altar in the center of the circle lay a man. He was naked, positioned on his back, and wearing a black mask. Sophie instantly recognized his body and the birthmark on his shoulder. She almost cried out. Grand-pere! This image alone would have shocked Sophie beyond belief, and yet there was more. Straddling her grandfather was a naked woman wearing a white mask, her luxuriant silver hair flowing out behind it. Her body was plump, far from perfect, and she was gyrating in rhythm to the chanting - making love to Sophie\u0027s grandfather. Sophie wanted to turn and run, but she couldn\u0027t. The stone walls of the grotto imprisoned her as the chanting rose to a fever pitch. The circle of participants seemed almost to be singing now, the noise rising in crescendo to a frenzy. With a sudden roar, the entire room seemed to erupt in climax. Sophie could not breathe. She suddenly realized she was quietly sobbing. She turned and staggered silently up the stairs, out of the house, and drove trembling back to Paris. CHAPTER 75 The chartered turboprop was just passing over the twinkling lights of Monaco when Aringarosa hung up on Fache for the second time. He reached for the airsickness bag again but felt too drained even to be sick. Just let it be over! Fache\u0027s newest update seemed unfathomable, and yet almost nothing tonight made sense anymore. What is going on? Everything had spiraled wildly out of control. What have I gotten Silas into? What have I gotten myself into! On shaky legs, Aringarosa walked to the cockpit. \"I need to change destinations.\" The pilot glanced over his shoulder and laughed. \"You\u0027re joking, right?\" \"No. I have to get to London immediately.\" \"Father, this is a charter flight, not a taxi.\" \"I will pay you extra, of course. How much? London is only one hour farther north and requires almost no change of direction, so - \" \"It\u0027s not a question of money, Father, there are other issues.\" \"Ten thousand euro. Right now.\" The pilot turned, his eyes wide with shock. \"How much? What kind of priest carries that kind of cash?\" Aringarosa walked back to his black briefcase, opened it, and removed one of the bearer bonds. He handed it to the pilot. \"What is this?\" the pilot demanded. \"A ten-thousand-euro bearer bond drawn on the Vatican Bank.\" The pilot looked dubious.\" It\u0027s the same as cash.\" \"Only cash is cash,\" the pilot said, handing the bond back. Aringarosa felt weak as he steadied himself against the cockpit door. \"This is a matter of life or death. You must help me. I need to get to London.\" The pilot eyed the bishop\u0027s gold ring. \"Real diamonds?\" Aringarosa looked at the ring. \"I could not possibly part with this.\" The pilot shrugged, turning and focusing back out the windshield. Aringarosa felt a deepening sadness. He looked at the ring. Everything it represented was about to be lost to the bishop anyway. After a long moment, he slid the ring from his finger and placed it gently on the instrument panel. Aringarosa slunk out of the cockpit and sat back down. Fifteen seconds later, he could feel the pilot banking a few more degrees to the north. Even so, Aringarosa\u0027s moment of glory was in shambles. It had all begun as a holy cause. A brilliantly crafted scheme. Now, like a house of cards, it was collapsing in on itself... and the end was nowhere in sight. CHAPTER 76 Langdon could see Sophie was still shaken from recounting her experience of Hieros Gamos. For his part, Langdon was amazed to have heard it. Not only had Sophie witnessed the full-blown ritual, but her own grandfather had been the celebrant... the Grand Master of the Priory of Sion. It was heady company. Da Vinci, Botticelli, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau...JacquesSauniere. \"I don\u0027t know what else I can tell you,\" Langdon said softly. Sophie\u0027s eyes were a deep green now, tearful. \"He raised me like his own daughter.\" Langdon now recognized the emotion that had been growing in her eyes as they spoke. It was remorse. Distant and deep. Sophie Neveu had shunned her grandfather and was now seeing him in an entirely different light. Outside, the dawn was coming fast, its crimson aura gathering off the starboard. The earth was still black beneath them. \"Victuals, my dears?\" Teabing rejoined them with a flourish, presenting several cans of Coke and a box of old crackers. He apologized profusely for the limited fare as he doled out the goods. \"Our friend the monk isn\u0027t talking yet,\" he chimed, \"but give him time.\" He bit into a cracker and eyed the poem. \"So, my lovely, any headway?\" He looked at Sophie. \"What is your grandfather trying to tell us here? Where the devil is this headstone? This headstone praised by Templars.\" Sophie shook her head and remained silent. While Teabing again dug into the verse, Langdon popped a Coke and turned to the window, his thoughts awash with images of secret rituals and unbroken codes. A headstone praised by Templarsis the key.He took a long sip from the can. A headstone praised by Templars.The cola was warm. The dissolving veil of night seemed to evaporate quickly, and as Langdon watched the transformation, he saw a shimmering ocean stretch out beneath them. The English Channel.It wouldn\u0027t be long now. Langdon willed the light of day to bring with it a second kind of illumination, but the lighter it became outside, the further he felt from the truth. He heard the rhythms of iambic pentameter and chanting, Hieros Gamos and sacred rites, resonating with the rumble of the jet. A headstone praised by Templars. The plane was over land again when a flash of enlightenment struck him. Langdon set down his empty can of Coke hard. \"You won\u0027t believe this,\" he said, turning to the others. \"The Templar headstone - I figured it out.\" Teabing\u0027s eyes turned to saucers. \"You know where the headstone is?\" Langdon smiled. \"Not where it is. What it is.\" Sophie leaned in to hear. \"I think the headstone references a literal stone head,\"Langdon explained, savoring the familiar excitement of academic breakthrough. \"Not a grave marker.\" \"A stone head?\" Teabing demanded. Sophie looked equally confused.\" Leigh,\" Langdon said, turning,\" during the Inquisition, the Church accused the Knights Templar of all kinds of heresies, right?\" \"Correct. They fabricated all kinds of charges. Sodomy, urination on the cross, devil worship, quite a list.\" \"And on that list was the worship of false idols, right? Specifically, the Church accused the Templars of secretly performing rituals in which they prayed to a carved stone head... the pagan god - \" \"Baphomet!\" Teabing blurted. \"My heavens, Robert, you\u0027re right! A headstone praised by Templars!\" Langdon quickly explained to Sophie that Baphomet was a pagan fertility god associated with the creative force of reproduction. Baphomet\u0027s head was represented as that of a ram or goat, a common symbol of procreation and fecundity. The Templars honored Baphomet by encircling a stone replica of his head and chanting prayers. \"Baphomet,\" Teabing tittered. \"The ceremony honored the creative magic of sexual union, but Pope Clement convinced everyone that Baphomet\u0027s head was in fact that of the devil. The Pope used the head of Baphomet as the linchpin in his case against the Templars.\" Langdon concurred. The modern belief in a horned devil known as Satan could be traced back to Baphomet and the Church\u0027s attempts to recast the horned fertility god as a symbol of evil. The Church had obviously succeeded, although not entirely. Traditional American Thanksgiving tables still bore pagan, horned fertility symbols. The cornucopia or\" horn of plenty\" was a tribute to Baphomet\u0027s fertility and dated back to Zeus being suckled by a goat whose horn broke off and magically filled with fruit. Baphomet also appeared in group photographs when some joker raised two fingers behind a friend\u0027s head in the V-symbol of horns; certainly few of the pranksters realized their mocking gesture was in fact advertising their victim\u0027s robust sperm count. \"Yes, yes,\" Teabing was saying excitedly. \"Baphomet must be what the poem is referring to. A headstone praised by Templars.\" \"Okay,\" Sophie said, \"but if Baphomet is the headstone praised by Templars, then we have a new dilemma.\" She pointed to the dials on the cryptex. \"Baphomet has eight letters. We only have room for five.\" Teabing grinned broadly. \"My dear, this is where the Atbash Cipher comes into play\" CHAPTER 77 Langdon was impressed. Teabing had just finished writing out the entire twenty-two-letter Hebrew alphabet - alef-beit - from memory. Granted, he\u0027d used Roman equivalents rather than Hebrew characters, but even so, he was now reading through them with flawless pronunciation. A B G D H V Z Ch T Y K L M N S O P Tz Q R Sh Th \"Alef, Beit, Gimel, Dalet, Hei, Vav, Zayin, Chet, Tet, Yud, Kaf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Samech, Ayin, Pei, Tzadik, Kuf, Reish, Shin, and Tav.\" Teabing dramatically mopped his brow and plowed on. \"In formal Hebrew spelling, the vowel sounds are not written. Therefore, when we write the word Baphomet using the Hebrew alphabet, it will lose its three vowels in translation, leaving us - \" \"Five letters,\" Sophie blurted. Teabing nodded and began writing again. \"Okay, here is the proper spelling of Baphomet inHebrew letters. I\u0027ll sketch in the missing vowels for clarity\u0027s sake. B a P V o M e Th \"Remember, of course,\" he added,\" that Hebrew is normally written in the opposite direction, but we can just as easily use Atbash this way. Next, all we have to do is create our substitution scheme by rewriting the entire alphabet in reverse order opposite the original alphabet.\" \"There\u0027s an easier way,\" Sophie said, taking the pen from Teabing. \"It works for all reflectional substitution ciphers, including the Atbash. A little trick I learned at the Royal Holloway.\" Sophie wrote the first half of the alphabet from left to right, and then, beneath it, wrote the second half, right to left. \"Cryptanalysts call it the fold-over. Half as complicated. Twice as clean.\" A B G D H V Z Ch T Y K Th Sh R Q Tz P O S N M L Teabing eyed her handiwork and chuckled. \"Right you are. Glad to see those boys at the Holloway are doing their job.\" Looking at Sophie\u0027s substitution matrix, Langdon felt a rising thrill that he imagined must have rivaled the thrill felt by early scholars when they first used the Atbash Cipher to decrypt the now famous Mystery of Sheshach.For years, religious scholars had been baffled by biblical references to a city called Sheshach.The city did not appear on any map nor in any other documents, and yet it was mentioned repeatedly in the Book of Jeremiah - the king of Sheshach, the city of Sheshach, the people of Sheshach. Finally, a scholar applied the Atbash Cipher to the word, and his results were mind-numbing. The cipher revealed that Sheshach was in fact a code word for another very well-known city. The decryption process was simple. Sheshach, in Hebrew, was spelled: Sh-Sh-K. Sh-Sh-K, when placed in the substitution matrix, became B-B-L. B-B-L, in Hebrew, spelled Babel. The mysterious city of Sheshach was revealed as the city of Babel, and a frenzy of biblical examination ensued. Within weeks, several more Atbash code words were uncovered in the Old Testament, unveiling myriad hidden meanings that scholars had no idea were there. \"We\u0027re getting close,\" Langdon whispered, unable to control his excitement. \"Inches, Robert,\" Teabing said. He glanced over at Sophie and smiled. \"You ready?\" She nodded.\" Okay, Baphomet in Hebrew without the vowels reads: B-P-V-M-Th.Now we simply apply your Atbash substitution matrix to translate the letters into our five-letter password.\" Langdon\u0027s heart pounded. B-P-V-M-Th.The sun was pouring through the windows now. He looked at Sophie\u0027s substitution matrix and slowly began to make the conversion. B is Sh...P is V... Teabing was grinning like a schoolboy at Christmas. \"And the Atbash Cipher reveals...\" He stopped short. \"Good God!\" His face went white. Langdon\u0027s head snapped up. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Sophie demanded. \"You won\u0027t believe this.\" Teabing glanced at Sophie. \"Especially you.\" \"What do you mean?\" she said.\" This is... ingenious,\" he whispered. \"Utterly ingenious!\" Teabing wrote again on the paper. \"Drumroll, please. Here is your password.\" He showed them what he had written. Sh-V-P-Y-A Sophie scowled. \"What is it?\" Langdon didn\u0027t recognize it either. Teabing\u0027s voice seemed to tremble with awe. \"This, my friend, is actually an ancient word of wisdom.\" Langdon read the letters again. An ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll.An instant later he got it. He had never seen this coming. \"An ancient word of wisdom!\" Teabing was laughing. \"Quite literally!\" Sophie looked at the word and then at the dial. Immediately she realized Langdon and Teabing had failed to see a serious glitch. \"Hold on! This can\u0027t be the password,\" she argued. \"The cryptex doesn\u0027t have an Sh on the dial. It uses a traditional Roman alphabet.\" \"Read the word,\" Langdon urged. \"Keep in mind two things. In Hebrew, the symbol for the sound Sh can also be pronounced as S, depending on the accent. Just as the letter P can be pronounced F.\" SVFYA? she thought, puzzled. \"Genius!\" Teabing added. \"The letter Vav is often a placeholder for the vowel sound O!\" Sophie again looked at the letters, attempting to sound them out.\" S... o... f... y... a.\" She heard the sound of her voice, and could not believe what she had just said. \"Sophia? This spells Sophia?\" Langdon was nodding enthusiastically. \"Yes! Sophia literally means wisdom in Greek. The root of your name, Sophie, is literally a \u0027word of wisdom.\u0027\" Sophie suddenly missed her grandfather immensely. He encrypted the Priory keystone with my name.A knot caught in her throat. It all seemed so perfect. But as she turned her gaze to the five lettered dials on the cryptex, she realized a problem still existed. \"But wait... the word Sophia has six letters.\" Teabing\u0027s smile never faded. \"Look at the poem again. Your grandfather wrote, \u0027An ancient word of wisdom.\u0027 \"Yes?\" Teabing winked. \"In ancient Greek, wisdom is spelled S-O-F-I-A.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-22.html","bookId":2227,"book":{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum.
