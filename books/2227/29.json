{"id":107233,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"CHAPTER 100\\n\\n Bishop Manuel Aringarosa\u0027s body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of the bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. Deep and grave. Not a wound of the flesh... but closer to the soul.\\n\\n He opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. Where am I? He could feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.\\n\\n Lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was Silas. The great albino was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail of agony. His red eyes were focused dead ahead, tears streaming down his pale, blood-spattered face. \"My son,\" Aringarosa whispered,\" you\u0027re hurt.\" Silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. \"I am so very sorry, Father.\" He seemed almost too pained to speak.\\n\\n \"No, Silas,\" Aringarosa replied. \"It is I who am sorry. This is my fault.\" The Teacher promised me there would be no killing, and I told you to obey him fully. \"I was too eager. Too fearful. You and I were deceived.\" The Teacher was never going to deliver us the Holy Grail.\\n\\n Cradled in the arms of the man he had taken in all those years ago, Bishop Aringarosa felt himself reel back in time. To Spain. To his modest beginnings, building a small Catholic church in Oviedo with Silas. And later, to New York City, where he had proclaimed the glory of God with the towering Opus Dei Center on Lexington Avenue.\\n\\n Five months ago, Aringarosa had received devastating news. His life\u0027s work was in jeopardy. He recalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside Castel Gandolfo that had changed his life... the news that had set this entire calamity into motion.\\n\\n Aringarosa had entered Gandolfo\u0027s Astronomy Library with his head held high, fully expecting to be lauded by throngs of welcoming hands, all eager to pat him on the back for his superior work representing Catholicism in America.\\n\\n But only three people were present. The Vatican secretariat. Obese. Dour. Two high-ranking Italian cardinals. Sanctimonious. Smug. \"Secretariat?\" Aringarosa said, puzzled. The rotund overseer of legal affairs shook Aringarosa\u0027s hand and motioned to the chair opposite him. \"Please, make yourself comfortable.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa sat, sensing something was wrong.\\n\\n \"I am not skilled in small talk, Bishop,\" the secretariat said,\" so let me be direct about the reason for your visit.\"\\n\\n \"Please. Speak openly.\" Aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed to be measuring him with self-righteous anticipation.\\n\\n \"As you are well aware,\" the secretariat said,\" His Holiness and others in Rome have been concerned lately with the political fallout from Opus Dei\u0027s more controversial practices.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa felt himself bristle instantly. He already had been through this on numerous occasions with the new pontiff, who, to Aringarosa\u0027s great dismay, had turned out to be a distressingly fervent voice for liberal change in the Church.\\n\\n \"I want to assure you,\" the secretariat added quickly,\" that His Holiness does not seek to change anything about the way you run your ministry.\"\\n\\n I should hope not!\" Then why am I here?\"\\n\\n The enormous man sighed. \"Bishop, I am not sure how to say this delicately, so I will state it directly. Two days ago, the Secretariat Council voted unanimously to revoke the Vatican\u0027s sanction of Opus Dei.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"Plainly stated, six months from today, Opus Dei will no longer be considered a prelature of the Vatican. You will be a church unto yourself. The Holy See will be disassociating itself from you. His Holiness agrees and we are already drawing up the legal papers.\"\\n\\n \"But... that is impossible!\"\\n\\n \"On the contrary, it is quite possible. And necessary. His Holiness has become uneasy with your aggressive recruiting policies and your practices of corporal mortification.\" He paused. \"Also your policies regarding women. Quite frankly, Opus Dei has become a liability and an embarrassment.\"\\n\\n Bishop Aringarosa was stupefied. \"An embarrassment?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this.\"\\n\\n \"Opus Dei is the only Catholic organization whose numbers are growing! We now have over eleven hundred priests!\"\\n\\n \"True. A troubling issue for us all.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa shot to his feet. \"Ask His Holiness if Opus Dei was an embarrassment in 1982 when we helped the Vatican Bank!\"\\n\\n \"The Vatican will always be grateful for that,\" the secretariat said, his tone appeasing,\" and yet there are those who still believe your financial munificence in 1982 is the only reason you were granted prelature status in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"That is not true!\" The insinuation offended Aringarosa deeply.\\n\\n \"Whatever the case, we plan to act in good faith. We are drawing up severance terms that will include a reimbursement of those monies. It will be paid in five installments.\"\\n\\n \"You are buying me off?\" Aringarosa demanded. \"Paying me to go quietly? When Opus Dei is the only remaining voice of reason!\"\\n\\n One of the cardinals glanced up. \"I\u0027m sorry, did you say reason?\"\\n\\n Aringarosa leaned across the table, sharpening his tone to a point. \"Do you really wonder why Catholics are leaving the Church? Look around you, Cardinal. People have lost respect. The rigors of faith are gone. The doctrine has become a buffet line. Abstinence, confession, communion, baptism, mass - take your pick - choose whatever combination pleases you and ignore the rest. What kind of spiritual guidance is the Church offering?\"\\n\\n \"Third-century laws,\" the second cardinal said,\" cannot be applied to the modern followers of Christ. The rules are not workable in today\u0027s society.\" \"Well, they seem to be working for Opus Dei!\" \"Bishop Aringarosa,\" the secretariat said, his voice conclusive. \"Out of respect for your organization\u0027s relationship with the previous Pope, His Holiness will be giving Opus Dei six months to voluntarily break away from the Vatican. I suggest you cite your differences of opinion with the Holy See and establish yourself as your own Christian organization.\"\\n\\n \"I refuse!\" Aringarosa declared. \"And I\u0027ll tell him that in person!\" \"I\u0027m afraid His Holiness no longer cares to meet with you.\" Aringarosa stood up. \"He would not dare abolish a personal prelature established by a previous Pope!\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" The secretariat\u0027s eyes did not flinch. \"The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.\" Aringarosa had staggered from that meeting in bewilderment and panic. Returning to New York, he stared out at the skyline in disillusionment for days, overwhelmed with sadness for the future of Christianity.\\n\\n It was several weeks later that he received the phone call that changed all that. The caller sounded\\n\\n French and identified himself as the Teacher - a title common in the prelature. He said he knew of the Vatican\u0027s plans to pull support from Opus Dei.\\n\\n How could he know that? Aringarosa wondered. He had hoped only a handful of Vatican power brokers knew of Opus Dei\u0027s impending annulment. Apparently the word was out. When it came to containing gossip, no walls in the world were as porous as those surrounding Vatican City.\\n\\n \"I have ears everywhere, Bishop,\" the Teacher whispered,\" and with these ears I have gained certain knowledge. With your help, I can uncover the hiding place of a sacred relic that will bring you enormous power... enough power to make the Vatican bow before you. Enough power to save the Faith.\" He paused. \"Not just for Opus Dei. But for all of us.\"\\n\\n The Lord taketh away...and the Lord giveth.Aringarosa felt a glorious ray of hope. \"Tell me your plan.\"\\n\\n Bishop Aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of St. Mary\u0027s Hospital hissed open. Silas lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. Dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he cried out for help. Everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino offering forth a bleeding clergyman.\\n\\n The doctor who helped Silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he felt Aringarosa\u0027s pulse. \"He\u0027s lost a lot of blood. I am not hopeful.\" Aringarosa\u0027s eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locating Silas. \"My child...\" Silas\u0027s soul thundered with remorse and rage. \"Father, if it takes my lifetime, I will find the one who deceived us, and I will kill him.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away. \"Silas... if you have learned nothing from me, please... learn this.\" He took Silas\u0027s hand and gave it a firm squeeze. \"Forgiveness is God\u0027s greatest gift.\"\\n\\n \"But Father...\"\\n\\n Aringarosa closed his eyes. \"Silas, you must pray.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 101\\n\\n Robert Langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted Chapter House and stared into the barrel of Leigh Teabing\u0027s gun.\\n\\n Robert, are you with me, or against me? The Royal Historian\u0027s words echoed in the silence of Langdon\u0027s mind.\\n\\n There was no viable response, Langdon knew. Answer yes, and he would be selling out Sophie. Answer no, and Teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.\\n\\n Langdon\u0027s years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handling confrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him something about answering paradoxical questions. When a question has no correct answer, there is only one honest response.\\n\\n The gray area between yes and no.\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n Staring at the cryptex in his hands, Langdon chose simply to walk away.\\n\\n Without ever lifting his eyes, he stepped backward, out into the room\u0027s vast empty spaces. Neutral ground.He hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled Teabing that collaboration might be an option, and that his silence signaled Sophie he had not abandoned her.\\n\\n All the while buying time to think.\\n\\n The act of thinking, Langdon suspected, was exactly what Teabing wanted him to do. That\u0027s whyhe handed me the cryptex.So I could feel the weight of my decision.The British historian hoped the touch of the Grand Master\u0027s cryptex would make Langdon fully grasp the magnitude of its contents, coaxing his academic curiosity to overwhelm all else, forcing him to realize that failure to unlock the keystone would mean the loss of history itself.\\n\\n With Sophie at gunpoint across the room, Langdon feared that discovering the cryptex\u0027s elusive password would be his only remaining hope of bartering her release. If I can free the map, Teabingwill negotiate.Forcing his mind to this critical task, Langdon moved slowly toward the far windows... allowing his mind to fill with the numerous astronomical images on Newton\u0027s tomb.\\n\\n You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb. It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb.\\n\\n Turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searching for any inspiration in their stained-glass mosaics. There was none.\\n\\n Place yourself in Sauniere\u0027s mind, he urged, gazing outward now into College Garden. What wouldhe believe is the orb that ought be on Newton\u0027s tomb? Images of stars, comets, and planets twinkled in the falling rain, but Langdon ignored them. Sauniere was not a man of science. He was a man of humanity, of art, of history. The sacred feminine...the chalice...the Rose...the banishedMary Magdalene...the decline of the goddess...the Holy Grail.\\n\\n Legend had always portrayed the Grail as a cruel mistress, dancing in the shadows just out of sight, whispering in your ear, luring you one more step and then evaporating into the mist.\\n\\n Gazing out at the rustling trees of College Garden, Langdon sensed her playful presence. The signs were everywhere. Like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of Britain\u0027s oldest apple tree burgeoned with five-petaled blossoms, all glistening like Venus. The goddess was in the garden now. She was dancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind the bud-filled branches as if to remind Langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyond his reach.\\n\\n Across the room, Sir Leigh Teabing watched with confidence as Langdon gazed out the window as if under a spell.\\n\\n Exactly as I hoped, Teabing thought. He will come around.\\n\\n For some time now, Teabing had suspected Langdon might hold the key to the Grail. It was no coincidence that Teabing launched his plan into action on the same night Langdon was scheduled to meet Jacques Sauniere. Listening in on the curator, Teabing was certain the man\u0027s eagerness to meet privately with Langdon could mean only one thing. Langdon\u0027s mysterious manuscript has touched a nerve with the Priory.\\n\\n Langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and Sauniere fears its release.Teabing felt certain the Grand Master was summoning Langdon to silence him.\\n\\n The Truth has been silenced long enough!\\n\\n Teabing knew he had to act quickly. Silas\u0027s attack would accomplish two goals. It would prevent Sauniere from persuading Langdon to keep quiet, and it would ensure that once the keystone was in Teabing\u0027s hands, Langdon would be in Paris for recruitment should Teabing need him.\\n\\n Arranging the fatal meeting between Sauniere and Silas had been almost too easy. I had inside information about Sauniere\u0027s deepest fears.Yesterday afternoon, Silas had phoned the curator and posed as a distraught priest. \"Monsieur Sauniere, forgive me, I must speak to you at once. I should never breach the sanctity of the confessional, but in this case, I feel I must. I just took confession from a man who claimed to have murdered members of your family.\"\\n\\n Sauniere\u0027s response was startled but wary. \"My family died in an accident. The police report was conclusive.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, a car accident,\" Silas said, baiting the hook. \"The man I spoke to said he forced their car off the road into a river.\" Sauniere fell silent.\" Monsieur Sauniere, I would never have phoned you directly except this man made a comment which makes me now fear for your safety.\" He paused. \"The man also mentioned your granddaughter, Sophie.\"\\n\\n The mention of Sophie\u0027s name had been the catalyst. The curator leapt into action. He ordered Silasto come see him immediately in the safest location Sauniere knew - his Louvre office. Then he phoned Sophie to warn her she might be in danger. Drinks with Robert Langdon were instantly abandoned.\\n\\n Now, with Langdon separated from Sophie on the far side of the room, Teabing sensed he had successfully alienated the two companions from one another. Sophie Neveu remained defiant, but Langdon clearly saw the larger picture. He was trying to figure out the password. He understands the importance of finding the Grail and releasing her from bondage.\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t open it for you,\" Sophie said coldly. \"Even if he can.\"\\n\\n Teabing was glancing at Langdon as he held the gun on Sophie. He was fairly certain now he was going to have to use the weapon. Although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate if it came to that. I have given her every opportunity to do the right thing.The Grail is bigger than any one of us.\\n\\n At that moment, Langdon turned from the window. \"The tomb...\" he said suddenly, facing them with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. \"I know where to look on Newton\u0027s tomb. Yes, I think I can find the password!\"\\n\\n Teabing\u0027s heart soared. \"Where, Robert? Tell me!\"\\n\\n Sophie sounded horrified. \"Robert, no! You\u0027re not going to help him, are you?\"\\n\\n Langdon approached with a resolute stride, holding the cryptex before him. \"No,\" he said, his eyes hardening as he turned to Leigh. \"Not until he lets you go.\"\\n\\n Teabing\u0027s optimism darkened. \"We are so close, Robert. Don\u0027t you dare start playing games with me!\"\\n\\n \"No games,\" Langdon said. \"Let her go. Then I\u0027ll take you to Newton\u0027s tomb. We\u0027ll open the cryptex together.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" Sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. \"That cryptex was given to me by my grandfather. It is not yours to open.\" Langdon wheeled, looking fearful. \"Sophie, please! You\u0027re in danger. I\u0027m trying to help you!\" \"How? By unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? He trusted you, Robert. Itrusted you!\"\\n\\n Langdon\u0027s blue eyes showed panic now, and Teabing could not help but smile to see the two of them working against one another. Langdon\u0027s attempts to be gallant were more pathetic than anything. On the verge of unveiling one of history\u0027s greatest secrets, and he troubles himself with a woman who has proven herself unworthy of the quest.\\n\\n \"Sophie,\" Langdon pleaded. \"Please... you must leave.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Not unless you either hand me the cryptex or smash it on the floor.\" \"What?\" Langdon gasped.\" Robert, my grandfather would prefer his secret lost forever than see it in the hands of his murderer.\" Sophie\u0027s eyes looked as if they would well with tears, but they did not. She stared directly back at Teabing. \"Shoot me if you have to. I am not leaving my grandfather\u0027s legacy in your hands.\"\\n\\n Very well.Teabing aimed the weapon.\\n\\n \"No!\" Langdon shouted, raising his arm and suspending the cryptex precariously over the hard stone floor. \"Leigh, if you even think about it, I will drop this.\"\\n\\n Teabing laughed. \"That bluff worked on Remy. Not on me. I know you better than that.\" \"Do you, Leigh?\" Yes I do. Your poker face needs work, my friend. It took me several seconds, but I can see now that you are lying. You have no idea where on Newton\u0027s tomb the answer lies. \"Truly, Robert? You know where on the tomb to look?\"\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n The falter in Langdon\u0027s eyes was fleeting but Leigh caught it. There was a lie there. A desperate, pathetic ploy to save Sophie. Teabing felt a profound disappointment in Robert Langdon.\\n\\n I am a lone knight, surrounded by unworthy souls. And I will have to decipher the keystone on my own.\\n\\n Langdon and Neveu were nothing but a threat to Teabing now... and to the Grail. As painful as the solution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with a clean conscience. The only challenge would be to persuade Langdon to set down the keystone so Teabing could safely end this charade.\\n\\n \"A show of faith,\" Teabing said, lowering the gun from Sophie. \"Set down the keystone, and we\u0027ll talk.\"\\n\\n Langdon knew his lie had failed.\\n\\n He could see the dark resolve in Teabing\u0027s face and knew the moment was upon them. When I setthis down, he will kill us both.Even without looking at Sophie, he could hear her heart beseeching him in silent desperation. Robert, this man is not worthy of the Grail.Please do not place it in his hands.No matter what the cost.\\n\\n Langdon had already made his decision several minutes ago, while standing alone at the window overlooking College Garden.\\n\\n Protect Sophie. Protect the Grail. Langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. But I cannot see how!\\n\\n The stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt. The Truth is right before your eyes, Robert.He knew not from where the epiphany came. The Grailis not mocking you, she is calling out to a worthy soul.\\n\\n Now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of Leigh Teabing, Langdon lowered the cryptex to within inches of the stone floor.\\n\\n \"Yes, Robert,\" Teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. \"Set it down.\"\\n\\n Langdon\u0027s eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the Chapter House cupola. Crouching lower, Langdon lowered his gaze to Teabing\u0027s gun, aimed directly at him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Leigh.\"\\n\\n In one fluid motion, Langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching the cryptex straight up toward the dome above.\\n\\n Leigh Teabing did not feel his finger pull the trigger, but the Medusa discharged with a thundering crash. Langdon\u0027s crouched form was now vertical, almost airborne, and the bullet exploded in the floor near Langdon\u0027s feet. Half of Teabing\u0027s brain attempted to adjust his aim and fire again in rage, but the more powerful half dragged his eyes upward into the cupola.\\n\\n The keystone!\\n\\n Time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream as Teabing\u0027s entire world became the airborne keystone. He watched it rise to the apex of its climb... hovering for a moment in the void... and then tumbling downward, end over end, back toward the stone floor.\\n\\n All of Teabing\u0027s hopes and dreams were plummeting toward earth. It cannot strike the floor! I can reach it! Teabing\u0027s body reacted on instinct. He released the gun and heaved himself forward, dropping his crutches as he reached out with his soft, manicured hands. Stretching his arms and fingers, he snatched the keystone from midair.\\n\\n Falling forward with the keystone victoriously clutched in his hand, Teabing knew he was falling too fast. With nothing to break his fall, his outstretched arms hit first, and the cryptex collided hard with the floor.\\n\\n There was a sickening crunch of glass within.\\n\\n For a full second, Teabing did not breathe. Lying there outstretched on the cold floor, staring the length of his outstretched arms at the marble cylinder in his bare palms, he implored the glass vial inside to hold. Then the acrid tang of vinegar cut the air, and Teabing felt the cool liquid flowing out through the dials onto his palm.\\n\\n Wild panic gripped him. NO! The vinegar was streaming now, and Teabing pictured the papyrus dissolving within. Robert, you fool! The secret is lost!\\n\\n Teabing felt himself sobbing uncontrollably. The Grail is gone.Everything destroyed.Shuddering in disbelief over Langdon\u0027s actions, Teabing tried to force the cylinder apart, longing to catch a fleeting glimpse of history before it dissolved forever. To his shock, as he pulled the ends of the keystone, the cylinder separated.\\n\\n He gasped and peered inside. It was empty except for shards of wet glass. No dissolving papyrus. Teabing rolled over and looked up at Langdon. Sophie stood beside him, aiming the gun down at Teabing.\\n\\n Bewildered, Teabing looked back at the keystone and saw it. The dials were no longer at random. They spelled a five-letter word: APPLE.\\n\\n \"The orb from which Eve partook,\" Langdon said coolly,\" incurring the Holy wrath of God. Original sin. The symbol of the fall of the sacred feminine.\"\\n\\n Teabing felt the truth come crashing down on him in excruciating austerity. The orb that ought be on Newton\u0027s tomb could be none other than the Rosy apple that fell from heaven, struck Newton on the head, and inspired his life\u0027s work. His labor\u0027s fruit! The Rosy flesh with a seeded womb!\\n\\n \"Robert,\" Teabing stammered, overwhelmed. \"You opened it. Where... is the map?\"\\n\\n Without blinking, Langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat and carefully extracted a delicate rolled papyrus. Only a few yards from where Teabing lay, Langdon unrolled the scroll and looked at it. After a long moment, a knowing smile crossed Langdon\u0027s face.\\n\\n He knows! Teabing\u0027s heart craved that knowledge. His life\u0027s dream was right in front of him. \"Tell me!\" Teabing demanded. \"Please! Oh God, please! It\u0027s not too late!\"\\n\\n As the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the Chapter House, Langdon quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.\\n\\n \"No!\" Teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.\\n\\n When the doors burst open, Bezu Fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning, finding his target - Leigh Teabing - helpless on the floor. Exhaling in relief, Fache holstered his Manurhin sidearm and turned to Sophie. \"Agent Neveu, I am relieved you and Mr. Langdon are safe. You should have come in when I asked.\"\\n\\n The British police entered on Fache\u0027s heels, seizing the anguished prisoner and placing him in handcuffs.\\n\\n Sophie seemed stunned to see Fache. \"How did you find us?\"\\n\\n Fache pointed to Teabing. \"He made the mistake of showing his ID when he entered the abbey. The guards heard a police broadcast about our search for him.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in Langdon\u0027s pocket!\" Teabing was screaming like a madman. \"The map to the Holy Grail!\"\\n\\n As they hoisted Teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled. \"Robert! Tell me where it\u0027s hidden!\"\\n\\n As Teabing passed, Langdon looked him in the eye. \"Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. You taught me that.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-29.html","bookId":2227,"book":{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum.
