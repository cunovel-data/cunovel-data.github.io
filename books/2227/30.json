Kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream of blood flowing from the bullet wound below his ribs. Still, he stared straight ahead.\\n\\n The fog made it look like heaven here.\\n\\n Raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers, turning them white again. As the droplets fell harder across his back and shoulders, he could feel his body disappearing bit by bit into the mist.\\n\\n I am a ghost.\\n\\n A breeze rustled past him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. With every living cell in his broken body, Silas prayed. He prayed for forgiveness. He prayed for mercy. And, above all, he prayed for his mentor... Bishop Aringarosa... that the Lord would not take him before his time. Hehas so much work left to do.\\n\\n The fog was swirling around him now, and Silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would carry him away. Closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.\\n\\n From somewhere in the mist, the voice of Manuel Aringarosa whispered to him.\\n\\n Our Lord is a good and merciful God.\\n\\n Silas\u0027s pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.\\n\\n CHAPTER 103\\n\\n It was late afternoon when the London sun broke through and the city began to dry. Bezu Fache felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and hailed a cab. Sir Leigh Teabing had vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet from his incoherent rantings about the Holy Grail, secret documents, and mysterious brotherhoods, Fache suspected the wily historian was setting the stage for his lawyers to plead an insanity defense.\\n\\n Sure, Fache thought. Insane.Teabing had displayed ingenious precision in formulating a plan that protected his innocence at every turn. He had exploited both the Vatican and Opus Dei, two groups that turned out to be completely innocent. His dirty work had been carried out unknowingly by a fanatical monk and a desperate bishop. More clever still, Teabing had situated his electronic listening post in the one place a man with polio could not possibly reach. The actual surveillance had been carried out by his manservant, Remy - the lone person privy to Teabing\u0027s true identity - now conveniently dead of an allergic reaction.\\n\\n Hardly the handiwork of someone lacking mental faculties, Fache thought.\\n\\n The information coming from Collet out of Chateau Villette suggested that Teabing\u0027s cunning ran so deep that Fache himself might even learn from it. To successfully hide bugs in some of Paris\u0027s most powerful offices, the British historian had turned to the Greeks. Trojan horses.Some of Teabing\u0027s intended targets received lavish gifts of artwork, others unwittingly bid at auctions in which Teabing had placed specific lots. In Sauniere\u0027s case, the curator had received a dinner invitation to Chateau Villette to discuss the possibility of Teabing\u0027s funding a new Da Vinci Wing at the Louvre. Sauniere\u0027s invitation had contained an innocuous postscript expressing fascination with a robotic knight that Sauniere was rumored to have built. Bring him to dinner, Teabing had suggested. Sauniere apparently had done just that and left the knight unattended long enough for Remy Legaludec to make one inconspicuous addition.\\n\\n Now, sitting in the back of the cab, Fache closed his eyes. One more thing to attend to before Ireturn to Paris.\\n\\n The St. Mary\u0027s Hospital recovery room was sunny.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve impressed us all,\" the nurse said, smiling down at him. \"Nothing short of miraculous.\" Bishop Aringarosa gave a weak smile. \"I have always been blessed.\" The nurse finished puttering, leaving the bishop alone. The sunlight felt welcome and warm on his face. Last night had been the darkest night of his life.\\n\\n Despondently, he thought of Silas, whose body had been found in the park.\\n\\n Please forgive me, my son.\\n\\n Aringarosa had longed for Silas to be part of his glorious plan. Last night, however, Aringarosa had received a call from Bezu Fache, questioning the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun who had been murdered in Saint-Sulpice. Aringarosa realized the evening had taken a horrifying turn. News of the four additional murders transformed his horror to anguish. Silas, what have you done! Unable to reach the Teacher, the bishop knew he had been cut loose. Used.The only way to stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to Fache, and from that moment on, Aringarosa and Fache had been racing to catch up with Silas before the Teacher persuaded him to kill again.\\n\\n Feeling bone weary, Aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the television coverage of the arrest of a prominent British knight, Sir Leigh Teabing. The Teacher laid bare for all to see.Teabing had caught wind of the Vatican\u0027s plans to disassociate itself from Opus Dei. He had chosen Aringarosa as the perfect pawn in his plan. After all, who more likely to leap blindly after the Holy Grail thana man like myself with everything to lose? The Grail would have brought enormous power to anyone who possessed it.\\n\\n Leigh Teabing had protected his identity shrewdly - feigning a French accent and a pious heart, and demanding as payment the one thing he did not need - money. Aringarosa had been far too eager to be suspicious. The price tag of twenty million euro was paltry when compared with the prize of obtaining the Grail, and with the Vatican\u0027s separation payment to Opus Dei, the finances had worked nicely. The blind see what they want to see.Teabing\u0027s ultimate insult, of course, had been to demand payment in Vatican bonds, such that if anything went wrong, the investigation would lead to Rome.\\n\\n \"I am glad to see you\u0027re well, My Lord.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa recognized the gruff voice in the doorway, but the face was unexpected - stern, powerful features, slicked-back hair, and a broad neck that strained against his dark suit. \"Captain Fache?\" Aringarosa asked. The compassion and concern the captain had shown for Aringarosa\u0027s plight last night had conjured images of a far gentler physique.\\n\\n The captain approached the bed and hoisted a familiar, heavy black briefcase onto a chair. \"I believe this belongs to you.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately looked away, feeling only shame. \"Yes... thank you.\" He paused while working his fingers across the seam of his bed sheet, then continued. \"Captain, I have been giving this deep thought, and I need to ask a favor of you.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"The families of those in Paris who Silas...\" He paused, swallowing the emotion. \"I realize no sum could possibly serve as sufficient restitution, and yet, if you could be kind enough to divide the contents of this briefcase among them... the families of the deceased.\"\\n\\n Fache\u0027s dark eyes studied him a long moment. \"A virtuous gesture, My Lord. I will see to it your wishes are carried out.\"\\n\\n A heavy silence fell between them.\\n\\n On the television, a lean French police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling mansion. Fache saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.\\n\\n \"Lieutenant Collet,\" a BBC reporter said, her voice accusing. \"Last night, your captain publicly charged two innocent people with murder. Will Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu be seeking accountability from your department? Will this cost Captain Fache his job?\"\\n\\n Lieutenant Collet\u0027s smile was tired but calm. \"It is my experience that Captain Bezu Fache seldom makes mistakes. I have not yet spoken to him on this matter, but knowing how he operates, I suspect his public manhunt for Agent Neveu and Mr. Langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the real killer.\"\\n\\n The reporters exchanged surprised looks.\\n\\n Collet continued. \"Whether or not Mr. Langdon and Agent Neveu were willing participants in the sting, I do not know. Captain Fache tends to keep his more creative methods to himself. All I can confirm at this point is that the captain has successfully arrested the man responsible, and that Mr. Langdon and Agent Neveu are both innocent and safe.\"\\n\\n Fache had a faint smile on his lips as he turned back to Aringarosa. \"A good man, that Collet.\"\\n\\n Several moments passed. Finally, Fache ran his hand over his forehead, slicking back his hair as he gazed down at Aringarosa. \"My Lord, before I return to Paris, there is one final matter I\u0027d like to discuss - your impromptu flight to London. You bribed a pilot to change course. In doing so, you broke a number of international laws.\" Aringarosa slumped. \"I was desperate.\" \"Yes. As was the pilot when my men interrogated him.\" Fache reached in his pocket and produced a purple amethyst ring with a familiar hand-tooled mitre-crozier applique.\\n\\n Aringarosa felt tears welling as he accepted the ring and slipped it back on his finger. \"You\u0027ve been so kind.\" He held out his hand and clasped Fache\u0027s. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Fache waved off the gesture, walking to the window and gazing out at the city, his thoughts obviously far away. When he turned, there was an uncertainty about him. \"My Lord, where do you go from here?\"\\n\\n Aringarosa had been asked the exact same question as he left Castel Gandolfo the night before. \"I suspect my path is as uncertain as yours.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Fache paused. \"I suspect I will be retiring early.\"\\n\\n Aringarosa smiled. \"A little faith can do wonders, Captain. A little faith.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 104\\n\\n Rosslyn Chapel - often called the Cathedral of Codes - stands seven miles south of Edinburgh, Scotland, on the site of an ancient Mithraic temple. Built by the Knights Templar in 1446, the chapel is engraved with a mind-boggling array of symbols from the Jewish, Christian, Egyptian, Masonic, and pagan traditions.\\n\\n The chapel\u0027s geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through Glastonbury. This longitudinal Rose Line is the traditional marker of King Arthur\u0027s Isle of Avalon and is considered the central pillar of Britain\u0027s sacred geometry. It is from this hallowed Rose Line that Rosslyn - originally spelled Roslin - takes its name.\\n\\n Rosslyn\u0027s rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as Robert Langdon and Sophie Neveu pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood. Their short flight from London to Edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had slept for the anticipation of what lay ahead. Gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept sky, Langdon felt like Alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. This must be a dream.And yet he knew the text of Sauniere\u0027s final message could not have been more specific.\\n\\n The Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\\n\\n Langdon had fantasized that Sauniere\u0027s \"Grail map\" would be a diagram - a drawing with an X- marks-the-spot - and yet the Priory\u0027s final secret had been unveiled in the same way Sauniere had spoken to them from the beginning. Simple verse.Four explicit lines that pointed without a doubt to this very spot. In addition to identifying Rosslyn by name, the verse made reference to several of the chapel\u0027s renowned architectural features.\\n\\n Despite the clarity of Sauniere\u0027s final revelation, Langdon had been left feeling more off balance than enlightened. To him, Rosslyn Chapel seemed far too obvious a location. For centuries, this stone chapel had echoed with whispers of the Holy Grail\u0027s presence. The whispers had turned to shouts in recent decades when ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishing structure beneath the chapel - a massive subterranean chamber. Not only did this deep vault dwarf the chapel atop it, but it appeared to have no entrance or exit. Archaeologists petitioned to begin blasting through the bedrock to reach the mysterious chamber, but the Rosslyn Trust expressly forbade any excavation of the sacred site. Of course, this only fueled the fires of speculation. What was the Rosslyn Trust trying to hide?\\n\\n Rosslyn had now become a pilgrimage site for mystery seekers. Some claimed they were drawn here by the powerful magnetic field that emanated inexplicably from these coordinates, some claimed they came to search the hillside for a hidden entrance to the vault, but most admitted they had come simply to wander the grounds and absorb the lore of the Holy Grail.\\n\\n Although Langdon had never been to Rosslyn before now, he always chuckled when he heard the chapel described as the current home of the Holy Grail. Admittedly, Rosslyn once might have been home to the Grail, long ago... but certainly no longer. Far too much attention had been drawn to Rosslyn in past decades, and sooner or later someone would find a way to break into the vault.\\n\\n True Grail academics agreed that Rosslyn was a decoy - one of the devious dead ends the Priory crafted so convincingly. Tonight, however, with the Priory\u0027s keystone offering a verse that pointed directly to this spot, Langdon no longer felt so smug. A perplexing question had been running through his mind all day:\\n\\n Why would Sauniere go to such effort to guide us to so obvious a location?\\n\\n There seemed only one logical answer.\\n\\n There is something about Rosslyn we have yet to understand.\\n\\n \"Robert?\" Sophie was standing outside the car, looking back at him. \"Are you corning?\" She was holding the rosewood box, which Captain Fache had returned to them. Inside, both cryptexes had been reassembled and nested as they had been found. The papyrus verse was locked safely at its core - minus the shattered vial of vinegar.\\n\\n Making their way up the long gravel path, Langdon and Sophie passed the famous west wall of the chapel. Casual visitors assumed this oddly protruding wall was a section of the chapel that had not been finished. The truth, Langdon recalled, was far more intriguing.\\n\\n The west wall of Solomon\u0027s Temple.\\n\\n The Knights Templar had designed Rosslyn Chapel as an exact architectural blueprint of Solomon\u0027s Temple in Jerusalem - complete with a west wall, a narrow rectangular sanctuary, and a subterranean vault like the Holy of Holies, in which the original nine knights had first unearthed their priceless treasure. Langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea of the Templars building a modern Grail repository that echoed the Grail\u0027s original hiding place. Rosslyn Chapel\u0027s entrance was more modest than Langdon expected. The small wooden door had two iron hinges and a simple, oak sign.\\n\\n ROSLIN\\n\\n This ancient spelling, Langdon explained to Sophie, derived from the Rose Line meridian on which the chapel sat; or, as Grail academics preferred to believe, from the\" Line of Rose\" - the ancestral lineage of Mary Magdalene.\\n\\n The chapel would be closing soon, and as Langdon pulled open the door, a warm puff of air escaped, as if the ancient edifice were heaving a weary sigh at the end of a long day. Her entry arches burgeoned with carved cinquefoils.\\n\\n Roses. The womb of the goddess.\\n\\n Entering with Sophie, Langdon felt his eyes reaching across the famous sanctuary and taking it all in. Although he had read accounts of Rosslyn\u0027s arrestingly intricate stonework, seeing it in person was an overwhelming encounter.\\n\\n Symbology heaven, one of Langdon\u0027s colleagues had called it.\\n\\n Every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols - Christian cruciforms, Jewish stars, Masonic seals, Templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids, astrological signs, plants, vegetables, pentacles, and roses. The Knights Templar had been master stonemasons, erecting Templar churches all over Europe, but Rosslyn was considered their most sublime labor of love and veneration. The master masons had left no stone uncarved. Rosslyn Chapel was a shrine to all faiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess.\\n\\n The sanctuary was empty except for a handful of visitors listening to a young man giving the day\u0027s last tour. He was leading them in a single-file line along a well-known route on the floor - an invisible pathway linking six key architectural points within the sanctuary. Generations of visitors had walked these straight lines, connecting the points, and their countless footsteps had engravedan enormous symbol on the floor.\\n\\n The Star of David, Langdon thought. No coincidence there.Also known as Solomon\u0027s Seal, this hexagram had once been the secret symbol of the stargazing priests and was later adopted by the Israelite kings - David and Solomon.\\n\\n The docent had seen Langdon and Sophie enter, and although it was closing time, offered a pleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around.\\n\\n Langdon nodded his thanks and began to move deeper into the sanctuary. Sophie, however, stood riveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Langdon asked.\\n\\n Sophie stared out at the chapel. \"I think... I\u0027ve been here.\"\\n\\n Langdon was surprised. \"But you said you hadn\u0027t even heard of Rosslyn.\"\\n\\n \"I hadn\u0027t...\" She scanned the sanctuary, looking uncertain. \"My grandfather must have brought me here when I was very young. I don\u0027t know. It feels familiar.\" As her eyes scanned the room, she began nodding with more certainty. \"Yes.\" She pointed to the front of the sanctuary. \"Those two pillars... I\u0027ve seen them.\"\\n\\n Langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of the sanctuary. Their white lacework carvings seemed to smolder with a ruddy glow as the last of the day\u0027s sunlight streamed in through the west window. The pillars - positioned where the altar would normally stand - were an oddly matched pair. The pillar on the left was carved with simple, vertical lines, while the pillar on the right was embellished with an ornate, flowering spiral.\\n\\n Sophie was already moving toward them. Langdon hurried after her, and as they reached the pillars, Sophie was nodding with incredulity. \"Yes, I\u0027m positive I have seen these!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t doubt you\u0027ve seen them,\" Langdon said,\" but it wasn\u0027t necessarily here.\"\\n\\n She turned. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"These two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history. Replicas exist all over the world.\"\\n\\n \"Replicas of Rosslyn?\" She looked skeptical.\\n\\n \"No. Of the pillars. Do you remember earlier that I mentioned Rosslyn itself is a copy of Solomon\u0027s Temple? Those two pillars are exact replicas of the two pillars that stood at the head of Solomon\u0027s Temple.\" Langdon pointed to the pillar on the left. \"That\u0027s called Boaz - or the Mason\u0027s Pillar. The other is called Jachin - or the Apprentice Pillar.\" He paused. \"In fact, virtually every Masonic temple in the world has two pillars like these.\"\\n\\n Langdon had already explained to her about the Templars\u0027 powerful historic ties to the modern Masonic secret societies, whose primary degrees - Apprentice Freemason, Fellowcraft Freemason, and Master Mason - harked back to early Templar days. Sophie\u0027s grandfather\u0027s final verse made direct reference to the Master Masons who adorned Rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings. It also noted Rosslyn\u0027s central ceiling, which was covered with carvings of stars and planets.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never been in a Masonic temple,\" Sophie said, still eyeing the pillars. \"I am almost positive I saw these here.\" She turned back into the chapel, as if looking for something else to jog her memory.\\n\\n The rest of the visitors were now leaving, and the young docent made his way across the chapel to them with a pleasant smile. He was a handsome young man in his late twenties, with a Scottish brogue and strawberry blond hair. \"I\u0027m about to close up for the day. May I help you find anything?\"\\n\\n How about the Holy Grail? Langdon wanted to say.\\n\\n \"The code,\" Sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. \"There\u0027s a code here!\" The docent looked pleased by her enthusiasm. \"Yes there is, ma\u0027am.\" \"It\u0027s on the ceiling,\" she said, turning to the right-hand wall. \"Somewhere over... there.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Not your first visit to Rosslyn, I see.\"\\n\\n The code, Langdon thought. He had forgotten that little bit of lore. Among Rosslyn\u0027s numerous mysteries was a vaulted archway from which hundreds of stone blocks protruded, jutting down to form a bizarre multifaceted surface. Each block was carved with a symbol, seemingly at random, creating a cipher of unfathomable proportion. Some people believed the code revealed the entrance to the vault beneath the chapel.\\n\\n Others believed it told the true Grail legend. Not that it mattered - cryptographers had been trying for centuries to decipher its meaning. To this day the Rosslyn Trust offered a generous reward to anyone who could unveil the secret meaning, but the code remained a mystery. \"I\u0027d be happy to show...\"\\n\\n The docent\u0027s voice trailed off.\\n\\n My first code, Sophie thought, moving alone, in a trance, toward the encoded archway. Having handed the rosewood box to Langdon, she could feel herself momentarily forgetting all about the Holy Grail, the Priory of Sion, and all the mysteries of the past day. When she arrived beneath the encoded ceiling and saw the symbols above her, the memories came flooding back. She was recalling her first visit here, and strangely, the memories conjured an unexpected sadness.\\n\\n She was a little girl... a year or so after her family\u0027s death. Her grandfather had brought her to Scotland on a short vacation. They had come to see Rosslyn Chapel before going back to Paris. It was late evening, and the chapel was closed. But they were still inside. \"Can we go home, Grand-pere?\" Sophie begged, feeling tired. \"Soon, dear, very soon.\" His voice was melancholy. \"I have one last thing I need to do here. How about if you wait in the car?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re doing another big person thing?\" He nodded. \"I\u0027ll be fast. I promise.\" \"Can I do the archway code again? That was fun.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I have to step outside. You won\u0027t be frightened in here alone?\" \"Of course not!\" she said with a huff. \"It\u0027s not even dark yet!\" He smiled. \"Very well then.\" He led her over to the elaborate archway he had shown her earlier.\\n\\n Sophie immediately plopped down on the stone floor, lying on her back and staring up at the collage of puzzle pieces overhead. \"I\u0027m going to break this code before you get back!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a race then.\" He bent over, kissed her forehead, and walked to the nearby side door. \"I\u0027ll be right outside. I\u0027ll leave the door open. If you need me, just call.\" He exited into the soft evening light.\\n\\n Sophie lay there on the floor, gazing up at the code. Her eyes felt sleepy. After a few minutes, the symbols got fuzzy. And then they disappeared.\\n\\n When Sophie awoke, the floor felt cold.\\n\\n \"Grand-pere?\"\\n\\n There was no answer. Standing up, she brushed herself off. The side door was still open. The evening was getting darker. She walked outside and could see her grandfather standing on the porch of a nearby stone house directly behind the church. Her grandfather was talking quietly to a person barely visible inside the screened door.\\n\\n \"Grand-pere?\" she called.\\n\\n Her grandfather turned and waved, motioning for her to wait just a moment. Then, slowly, he said some final words to the person inside and blew a kiss toward the screened door. He came to her with tearful eyes.\\n\\n \"Why are you crying, Grand-pere?\"\\n\\n He picked her up and held her close. \"Oh, Sophie, you and I have said good-bye to a lot of people this year. It\u0027s hard.\"\\n\\n Sophie thought of the accident, of saying good-bye to her mother and father, her grandmother and baby brother. \"Were you saying goodbye to another person?\"\\n\\n \"To a dear friend whom I love very much,\" he replied, his voice heavy with emotion. \"And I fear I will not see her again for a very long time.\"\\n\\n Standing with the docent, Langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feeling a rising wariness that a dead end might be looming. Sophie had wandered off to look at the code and left Langdon holding the rosewood box, which contained a Grail map that now appeared to be no help at all. Although Sauniere\u0027s poem clearly indicated Rosslyn, Langdon was not sure what to do now that they had arrived. The poem made reference to a \u0027blade and chalice\u0027, which Langdon saw nowhere.\\n\\n The Holy Grail \u0027neath ancient Roslin waits.\\n\\n The blade and chalice guarding o\u0027er Her gates.\\n\\n Again Langdon sensed there remained some facet of this mystery yet to reveal itself.\\n\\n \"I hate to pry,\" the docent said, eyeing the rosewood box in Langdon\u0027s hands. \"But this box... might I ask where you got it?\"\\n\\n Langdon gave a weary laugh. \"That\u0027s an exceptionally long story.\"\\n\\n The young man hesitated, his eyes on the box again. \"It\u0027s the strangest thing - my grandmother has a box exactly like that - a jewelry box. Identical polished rosewood, same inlaid rose, even the hinges look the same.\"\\n\\n Langdon knew the young man must be mistaken. If ever a box had been one of a kind, it was thisone - the box custom-made for the Priory keystone. \"The two boxes may be similar but - \"\\n\\n The side door closed loudly, drawing both of their gazes. Sophie had exited without a word and was now wandering down the bluff toward a fieldstone house nearby. Langdon stared after her. Where is she going? She had been acting strangely ever since they entered the building. He turned to the docent. \"Do you know what that house is?\"\\n\\n He nodded, also looking puzzled that Sophie was going down there. \"That\u0027s the chapel rectory. The chapel curator lives there. She also happens to be the head of the Rosslyn Trust.\" He paused. \"And my grandmother.\"\\n\\n \"Your grandmother heads the Rosslyn Trust?\"\\n\\n The young man nodded. \"I live with her in the rectory and help keep up the chapel and give tours.\" He shrugged. \"I\u0027ve lived here my whole life. My grandmother raised me in that house.\"\\n\\n Concerned for Sophie, Langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to call out to her. He was only halfway there when he stopped short. Something the young man said just registered.\\n\\n My grandmother raised me.\\n\\n Langdon looked out at Sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in his hand. Impossible. Slowly, Langdon turned back to the young man. \"You said your grandmother has a box like this one?\"\\n\\n \"Almost identical.\" \"Where did she get it?\" \"My grandfather made it for her. He died when I was a baby, but my grandmother still talks about him. She says he was a genius with his hands. He made all kinds of things.\"\\n\\n Langdon glimpsed an unimaginable web of connections emerging. \"You said your grandmother raised you. Do you mind my asking what happened to your parents?\"\\n\\n The young man looked surprised. \"They died when I was young.\" He paused. \"The same day as my grandfather.\"\\n\\n Langdon\u0027s heart pounded. \"In a car accident?\"\\n\\n The docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes. \"Yes. In a car accident. My entire family died that day. I lost my grandfather, my parents, and...\" He hesitated, glancing down at the floor. \"And your sister,\" Langdon said.\\n\\n Out on the bluff, the fieldstone house was exactly as Sophie remembered it. Night was falling now, and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. The smell of bread wafted through the opened screened door, and a golden light shone in the windows. As Sophie approached, she could hear the quiet sounds of sobbing from within.\\n\\n Through the screened door, Sophie saw an elderly woman in the hallway. Her back was to the door, but Sophie could see she was crying. The woman had long, luxuriant, silver hair that conjured an unexpected wisp of memory. Feeling herself drawn closer, Sophie stepped onto the porch stairs. The woman was clutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertips to his face with loving sadness. It was a face Sophie knew well. Grand-pere.\\n\\n The woman had obviously heard the sad news of his death last night.\\n\\n A board squeaked beneath Sophie\u0027s feet, and the woman turned slowly, her sad eyes finding Sophie\u0027s. Sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed. The woman\u0027s fervent gaze never wavered as she set down the photo and approached the screened door. An eternity seemed to pass as the two women stared at one another through the thin mesh. Then, like the slowly gathering swell of an ocean wave, the woman\u0027s visage transformed from one of uncertainty... to disbelief... to hope... and finally, to cresting joy.\\n\\n Throwing open the door, she came out, reaching with soft hands, cradling Sophie\u0027s thunderstruck face. \"Oh, dear child... look at you!\"\\n\\n Although Sophie did not recognize her, she knew who this woman was. She tried to speak but found she could not even breathe.\\n\\n \"Sophie,\" the woman sobbed, kissing her forehead.\\n\\n Sophie\u0027s words were a choked whisper. \"But... Grand-pere said you were...\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" The woman placed her tender hands on Sophie\u0027s shoulders and gazed at her with familiar eyes. \"Your grandfather and I were forced to say so many things. We did what we thought was right. I\u0027m so sorry. It was for your own safety, princess.\"\\n\\n Sophie heard her final word, and immediately thought of her grandfather, who had called her princess for so many years. The sound of his voice seemed to echo now in the ancient stones of Rosslyn, settling through the earth and reverberating in the unknown hollows below.\\n\\n The woman threw her arms around Sophie, the tears flowing faster. \"Your grandfather wanted so badly to tell you everything. But things were difficult between you two. He tried so hard. There\u0027sso much to explain. So very much to explain.\" She kissed Sophie\u0027s forehead once again, then whispered in her ear. \"No more secrets, princess. It\u0027s time you learn the truth about our family.\"\\n\\n Sophie and her grandmother were seated on the porch stairs in a tearful hug when the young docent dashed across the lawn, his eyes shining with hope and disbelief.\\n\\n \"Sophie?\"\\n\\n Through her tears, Sophie nodded, standing. She did not know the young man\u0027s face, but as they embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins... the blood she now understood they shared.\\n\\n When Langdon walked across the lawn to join them, Sophie could not imagine that only yesterday she had felt so alone in the world. And now, somehow, in this foreign place, in the company of three people she barely knew, she felt at last that she was home. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-da-vinci-code-robert-langdon-2/page-30.html","bookId":2227,"book":{"id":2227,"title":"The Da Vinci Code (Robert Langdon #2)","description":"Storyline: While in Paris on business, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon receives an urgent late-night phone call: the elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum. Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. While working to solve the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da Vinci-clues visible for all to see-yet ingeniously disguised by the painter. Langdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion-an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. In a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who seems to anticipate their every move. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory\u0027s ancient secret-and an explosive historical truth-will be lost forever.
