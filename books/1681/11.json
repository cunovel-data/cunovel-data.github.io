Of course.” The General turns back to me. “Adamus,” he says, “do not disappoint me.” “No, sir,” I reply. CHAPTER 23 Ivan watches the mosquito bite his forearm, shakily take flight and then plummet dead onto the hut’s wooden floor. Our blood is apparently poisonous to the insects, although that doesn’t stop them from trying. Ivan glowers at the swollen bites reddening his arms. “We should’ve just wiped this place out,” he grumbles. The three tanned Italian aid-workers in the hut with us pretend not to have heard him. I don’t know who they think we are, what story they were told to convince them to let us pose as fellow volunteers, but I can tell they’re afraid. I imagine they all have relatives locked in a place like West Virginia, that their complicity is part of some screwed-up deal my people forced on them. I wish I could tell them they weren’t in danger, that this would all be over soon, but that would be a lie. We arrived in the village yesterday, in a Jeep driven by one of the sullen aid-workers. The place is small, carved out of the encroaching jungle. It’s comprised of huts around a single well and a modest outdoor marketplace. The village is on the road to Nairobi, so its marketplace attracts people from smaller nearby villages, here to trade with each other or sell goods to the tourists that pass by on buses twice a day. There is a small basketball court next to the hut the aid-workers live in, built by their predecessors to help them connect with the locals. Children sprint across the flattened soil, tossing a ragged, dark-brown basketball at the netless hoop. Ivan and I are the perfect choices to be posing as aid-workers. We’re the right age for it: idealistic teenagers come to volunteer their time between high school and college. It’s the kind of activity that would look great on a kid’s college application. Of course, for Mogadorians, assisting the less fortunate would be viewed as a waste of time. “Humanitarian aid,” spits One, appearing at my side. “Your people have a sick sense of humor.” I shake my head. She’s right, but I doubt the General realizes the grotesque irony of our cover. To my people, these aid-workers and the villagers are mere tactical assets, pawns to help us smoke out the Garde that might be hiding in the jungle. Today the aid-workers have circulated word that they have a new shipment of vaccine for the village youths, something to fight against malaria. One by one the local children line up to grit their teeth and receive a shot. When the children stop by our tent, Ivan and I study them. Most of them arrive barefoot or in sandals, but the ones wearing sneakers or socks are ordered by Ivan to take off their shoes and socks. None of them finds this strange. Humans are too trusting. There are many kids the age of the one we’re looking for, but none of them bears the Loric scar. Every smooth ankle is a relief to me. One of the kids receiving his injection stares at Ivan, then says something in Swahili. The other children in line laugh. “What did he say?” I ask. The aid-worker with the needle pauses, giving me a nervous look. Then, in shaky English, replies, “He says your friend looks like pale hippo.” Ivan takes a step towards the boy, but I stop him with a hand on his shoulder. “The boy’s right,” I tell the aid-worker, “he does look like a hippo.” I flash the boy a thumbs-up, and the children laugh again. “This is a waste of time,” seethes Ivan, and he stomps into the hut’s backroom, where we’ve stored our equipment. I assume he’s going to report to my father: no Loric found yet; Kenyan children hurt my feelings. I step outside the hut, watching as the villagers go about a normal day. I can’t help but indulge in a fantasy like I used to when observing Washington DC, about what kind of improvements could be made to this place. This time it’s not a fantasy of conquest; it’s one of assistance. With the technological advancements the Mogadorians are capable of, we could vastly improve these people’s lives. “Their lives would be most improved,” says One, “if you just left their planet the hell alone.” “You’re right,” I whisper back, feeling stupid. On the basketball court, teams are beginning to form up. A boy about fourteen years old sees me watching and waves. When I wave back, he jogs over and says something in what I think is Italian. “I’m sorry,” I say, “I don’t understand.” “Ah,” says the boy, and I see the wheels turning as he tries to place my language. “English? American?” I nod. The boy is fit, tall for his age. He is dark skinned, yet a few shades lighter than many of the other villagers, a smattering of sun-born freckles across his cheeks and nose. He looks somehow exotic. He is wearing a tank top and mesh shorts, a pair of worn basketball high-tops and striped high socks. High socks. My stomach drops as I realize who he is. The Garde. “Sorry,” he says in slow but perfect English. “The other aid-workers speak Italian. My English is a little rusty.” “No,” I say, swallowing hard. “It’s very good.” He steps forward to shake my hand. “I’m Hannu.” “Adam.” “Like the first man. That’s good, but right now we need a tenth man for even teams.” He gestures over his shoulder at the other kids waiting on the basketball court. “You want to play?” What I want is to scream at Hannu to run. I glance over my shoulder, wondering where Ivan is. I can’t make this too obvious, can’t make a scene. If Ivan detects anything unusual, he’ll radio in to my father right away. Hannu’s only advantage right now is that my people don’t know who he is. There’s still a chance for him and whoever his Cêpan is to slip away undetected. I need to get him away from the aid-worker’s hut. “Sure,” I say, although I’ve never so much as touched a basketball. “I’ll play.” We haven’t gone three steps before Ivan is jogging to catch up to us. The only way to describe his grin is shit eating. “Adam,” he says, talking to me while sizing up Hannu. “Who’s your new friend?” “Hannu,” replies the Garde, shaking Ivan’s hand. I can tell by the way Hannu grimaces that Ivan’s grip is vice-like. “Another American. Cool.” Everything about Hannu is easygoing, even the leisurely way he walks us over to the basketball court. He looks at home here, comfortable. Too comfortable. I wonder how long he’s lived here—how often he’s come to this court to shoot hoops. I think about the paranoid behavior of the other Cêpans, the nomadic life that One was forced to endure, the shut-in existence of Two. It seems like Hannu has had such a peaceful time on Earth that he’s forgotten there’s a war on. Some of the younger children beam at Hannu as he passes by. He pats them on their heads, smiling back, joking with them in Swahili. I wonder how many languages he knows. “Did you get vaccinated?” Ivan asks, blunt as ever. “I don’t remember you coming by.” Hannu waves this away with a serene smile. “Me? I’m strong like an ox. Save that for the kids that really need it.” One of the other kids passes Hannu the ball, and he floats up a shot on a lazy arc. It drops through the basket without even brushing the rim. “Have you lived here long?” I venture. “All my life,” he replies. The kids pass the ball back to Hannu, and he flips it over to Ivan. “Take a shot, big man.” Ivan squeezes the ball so tightly that for a moment I’m afraid it will pop. Then he hurls it towards the basket in an ugly imitation of Hannu’s stroke, the ball clanging wildly off the side of the backboard. Some of the kids, including the one who called Ivan a hippo, laugh. “Good try,” says Hannu cheerily, winking at the laughing kids. Ivan’s expression darkens. I jump in, trying to direct the conversation in a way that will raise Hannu’s dormant danger alarms without tipping off Ivan. “Is it weird to have strangers just showing up at your village?” I ask. Hannu shrugs. “We get tourists on the bus sometimes.” He glances over at Ivan. “I hope you guys packed sunscreen. Your friend is turning red.” Ivan grabs my arm before I can form another awkward question. “Come on, Adam. We have work to do.” Hannu looks disappointed as Ivan drags me away. “Maybe we’ll play later, yeah?” “I hope so,” I tell him. As soon as we’re out of earshot, Ivan hisses to me, “That was him!” He looks thrilled. “You might be worthless in a fight, but you can sniff out a Garde better than any of our scouts.” I glance over my shoulder. Hannu has already put us out of his mind, helping some of the younger kids practice their form. “We can’t confirm that’s him,” I say. “Oh, come on, Adamus,” groans Ivan. “I should’ve choked him right out there.” “You don’t want to waste the General’s time until we can be sure,” I say, trying to buy time. “Plus, even if that is our Garde, you don’t know he’s Number Three.” Ivan sneers at me, and I can tell his mind is made up. When we get back into the hut, he grabs the nearest aid-worker by the shirt and pulls him over to the window. “That kid,” he says, pointing at Hannu. “Where does he live?” The aid-worker hesitates, but I can see the fear in his eyes. “Not sure,” he mumbles. “Outside the village, I think. Near the ravine.” “Good enough,” says Ivan, shoving the aid-worker away. He glances at me before disappearing into the backroom. “I’ll tell Father you say hi.” So that’s it. Soon the strike team will be here. I return to the doorway, watching Hannu dribble past a defender and flip a layup into the basket. “He’s dense,” observes One, suddenly standing next to me, looking at Hannu. “You have to tell him.” I nod. No more waiting around, no more planning, no more subtlety. There will never be a more perfect opportunity to defect. I’ve already watched one Loric die because of my uncertainty, because I failed to act in time. I won’t let this one be captured, or worse. “You’re right,” I whisper back. “Tonight, we escape.” CHAPTER 24 Night has fallen. The jungle around me is alive with strange noises. I should be worried about what kinds of animals are out there, snapping branches as they stalk me, hissing around my ankles. But there are other, more dangerous predators in the jungle tonight. Ones that I need to stop. I run through the jungle with only a vague idea of where I’m going. Maybe running isn’t exactly accurate—more like stumbling; it seems like every vine on the jungle floor has a mind to trip me. It’s so dark out here, I’m practically blind. My knees and elbows are scraped from falls, my face cut from the branches slapping against it. Still, I press on toward the ravine.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-fallen-legacies-lorien-legacies-the-lost-files-3/page-11.html","bookId":1681,"book":{"id":1681,"title":"The Fallen Legacies (Lorien Legacies: The Lost Files #3)","description":"Storyline: The Fallen Legacies (Lorien Legacies: The Lost Files #3) Before Number Four, there were One, Two, and Three.
