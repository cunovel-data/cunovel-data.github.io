{"id":72022,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Conway had finished his drink. Now he rose to go, shaking hands with a look of settled melancholy on his face. He said, almost as an afterthought, \"But you know, we haven\u0027t heard Lucky\u0027s testimony yet. If the effects aren\u0027t as bad as you think, if his testimony should even prove harmless, would you work then on behalf of peace?\" Doremo shrugged. \"You are grasping at straws. Yes, yes, in the unlikely case that the conference is not stampeded past recall by your foster son\u0027s words, I will do my bit. As I told you, I am really on your side.\" \"I thank you, sir.\" They shook hands again. Doremo stared after the departing Chief Councilman with a sad little shake of his head. Outside the door, however, Conway paused to catch his breath. It was really quite as much as he had expected. Now if only the Sirians would present Lucky. The conference opened on the stiff and formal note to be expected. Everyone was painfully correct, and when Earth\u0027s delegation entered to take their posts in the front and at the extreme right of the hall, all the delegates already seated, even the Sirians in the front and extreme left, rose. When the Secretary of State, representing the host power, rose to make a welcoming speech, he spoke in generalities about peace and the door it opened to the continuing expansion of mankind through the Galaxy, of the common ancestry and brotherhood of all men, of the grievous disaster war would be. He carefully made no mention of the specific points of issue, did not refer to Sirius by name, and, above all, made no threats. He was graciously applauded. Then the conference voted Agas Doremo into the chair to preside (he was the only man on whom both sides could agree), and the chief business of the conference began. The conference was not open to the public, but there were special booths for reporters from the various worlds represented. They were not to interview individual delegates but were allowed to listen and send out uncensored reports. The proceedings, as was customary in such interstellar gatherings, were carried on in Interlingua, the language amalgam that served throughout the Galaxy. After a short speech by Doremo extolling the virtues of compromise and begging no one to be so stubborn as to risk war where a slight yielding might insure peace, he recognized Earth\u0027s Secretary of State once more. This time the Secretary was a partisan, presenting his side of the dispute forcefully and well. There was, however, no mistaking the hostile attitude of the other delegates. It hung like a fog over the assembly hall. Conway sat next to the orating Secretary, with his chin digging into his chest. Ordinarily it would be a mistake for Earth to present its major speech at the very start. It would be a case of shooting off the best ammunition before the nature of the target was known. It would give Sinus the opportunity for a crushing rebuttal. But in this case, however, this was exactly what Conway wanted. He whipped out a handkerchief, passed it over his forehead, then put it hastily back and hoped he had not been noticed. He did not want to seem worried. Sirius reserved its rebuttal and, undoubtedly by arrangement, representatives of three of the outer worlds, three that were notoriously under Sirian influence, rose to speak briefly. Each avoided the direct problem but commented forcefully on the aggressive intentions of Earth and on its ambitions to reimpose a galactic government under its own rule. They set the stage for the eventual Sirian display and, having done so, there was a lunch recess. Finally, six hours after the conference had been called to order, Sten Devoure of Sirius was recognized and rose slowly to his feet. He stepped forward with quiet deliberation to the rostrum and stood there, looking down upon the delegates with an expression of proud confidence on his olive-skinned face. (There was no sign of his misadventure with Bigman.) There was a stir among the delegates that quieted only after a number of minutes during which Devoure made no effort to begin speaking. Conway was certain that every delegate knew that Lucky Starr would be testifying soon. They were waiting for this complete humiliation of Earth with excitement and anticipation. Devoure began his speech at last, very quietly. His introduction was historical. Going back to the days when Sirius was a Terrestrial colony, he rehearsed once again the grievances of that day. He brushed over the Hegellian Doctrine, which had established the independence of Sirius as well as that of the other colonies, as insincere, and one by one cited the supposed efforts of Earth to re-establish domination. Coming down to the present, he said, \"We are now accused of having colonized an unoccupied world. We plead guilty to that. We are accused of having taken an empty world and made it a beautiful habitation for human beings. We plead guilty to that. We are accused of extending the range of the human race to a world suitable for it that had been neglected by others. We plead guilty to that. \"We have not been accused of offering violence to anyone in the process. We have not been accused of making war, of killing and wounding, in the course of our occupation. We are accused of no crime at all. Instead, it is merely stated that not quite a billion miles away from the world we now so peacefully occupy there is another occupied world named Earth. \"We are not aware that this has anything to do with our world, Saturn. We offer no violence to Earth, and they accuse us of none. We ask only the privilege of being left to ourselves, and in return for that we are glad to offer to leave them to themselves. \"They say Saturn is theirs. Why? Have they occupied its satellites at any time? No. Have they shown interest in it? No. For the thousands of years during which it was theirs for the taking, did they want it? No. It was only after we landed on it that they suddenly discovered their interest in it. \"They say Saturn circles about the same Sun that Earth does. We admit that, but we also point out that the fact is irrelevant. An empty world is an empty world, regardless of the particular route it travels through space. We colonized it first and it is ours. \"Now I have said that Sirius occupied the Saturnian system without force of any kind and without the threat of force; that we are actuated in all we do by a desire for peace. We do not speak much of peace, as Earth does, but we at least practice it. When Earth called for a conference, we accepted at once, for the sake of peace, even though there is no shadow of any sort on our title to the Saturnian system. \"But what of Earth? How does it back its views? They are very fluent in their talks on peace, but their actions match their words very poorly. They called for peace and practiced war. They demanded a conference and at the same time outfitted a war expedition. In short, while Sirius risked its interests for the sake of peace, Earth, in return, made unprovoked war upon us. I can prove this from the mouth of a member of Earth\u0027s own Council of Science.\" He raised his hand as he spoke the last sentence, his first gesture of any sort, and pointed dramatically to a doorway upon which a spot of light had been allowed to fall. Lucky Starr was standing there, tall and defiantly straight. A robot flanked him on either side. Lucky, on being brought down to Vesta, finally saw Bigman again. The little Martian ran to him, while Yonge looked on with dour amusement from a distance. \"Lucky,\" pleaded Bigman. \"Sands of Mars, Lucky, don\u0027t go through with it. They can\u0027t make you say a word if you don\u0027t want to, and it doesn\u0027t really matter what happens to me.\" Slowly Lucky shook his head. \"Wait, Bigman. Wait one more day.\" Yonge came up and took Bigman by the elbow. \"Sorry, Starr, but we need him till you\u0027re through. Devoure has a great sense of hostage, and at this point I rather think he\u0027s right. You\u0027re going to have to face your own people, and dishonor will be difficult.\" Lucky nerved himself for just that when he finally stood hi the doorway and felt the eyes upon him, the silence, the caught breaths. In the spotlight himself, Lucky saw the delegates to the conference as nothing but a giant black mass. It was only after the robots led him into the witness box that faces swam out of the crowd at him, and he could see Hector Conway in the front row. For a moment Conway smiled at him with weary affection, but Lucky dared not smile back. This was the crisis and he must do nothing that, even at this late moment, might warn the Sirians. Devoure stared at the Earthman hungrily, savoring his coming triumph. He said, \"Gentlemen. I wish temporarily to convert this conference into something approaching a court of law. I have a witness here whom I wish all the delegates to hear. I well rest my case on what he says-he, an Earthman and an important agent of the Council of Science.\" He then said to Lucky with sudden sharpness, \"Your name, citizenship, and position, please.\" Lucky said, \"I am David Starr, native of Earth, and member of the Council of Science.\" \"Have you been subjected to drugs, to psychic probing, or to mental violence of any sort to induce you to testify here?\" \"No, sir.\" \"You speak voluntarily, and will tell the truth?\" \"I speak voluntarily and will tell the truth.\" Devoure turned to the delegates. \"It may occur to some of you that Councilman Starr has indeed been handled mentally without his knowledge or that he may be denying mental harm as the very result of that mental harm. If so, he may be examined by any member of this conference with medical qualification-I know there are a number of such-if anyone demands such examination.\" No one made the demand, and Devoure went on, addressing Lucky, \"When did you first become aware of the Sirian base within the Saturnian system?\" Curtly, unemotionally, eyes staring stonily forward, Lucky told of the first entry into the Saturnian system and the warning to leave. Conway nodded slightly at Lucky\u0027s complete omission of the capsule or of Agent X\u0027s spying activities. Agent X might have been merely a Terrestrial criminal. Obviously Sirius wanted no mention of its own spying at this time and, as obviously, Lucky was satisfied to go along with them in this. \"And did you leave after being warned?\" \"I did, sir.\" \"Permanently?\" \"No, sir.\" \"What did you do next?\" Lucky described the ruse with Hidalgo, the approach to Saturn\u0027s south pole, the flight through the gap in the rings to Mimas. Devoure interrupted, \"Did we at any time offer violence to your ship?\" \"No, sir.\" Devoure turned to the delegates again. \"There is no need to rely only upon the word of the Councilman. I have here telephotos of the pursuit of the Councilman\u0027s ship to Mimas.\" While Lucky remained in the spotlight the rest of the chamber was darkened, and in the three-dimensional imagery the delegates watched scenes of The Shooting Starr speeding toward the rings and disappearing into a gap which, at the angle of photography, could not be seen. It was next shown racing headlong into Mimas and disappearing in a flash of ruddy light and vapor. At this time Devoure must have felt the growth of a furtive admiration for the daring of the Earthman, for he said with a touch of annoyed haste, \"Our inability to overtake the Councilman was the result of his ship\u0027s equipment with Agrav motors. Maneuvers in the neighborhood of Saturn were more difficult for us than for him. For that reason we ourselves had not previously approached Mimas and were not psychologically ready for his doing so.\" If Conway had dared he would have shouted aloud at that. The fool! Devoure would pay for that moment of jealousy. Of course by mentioning Agrav he was trying to stir up the outer worlds\u0027 fears of Earth\u0027s scientific advances, and that might be a mistake too. The fears might grow too strong. Devoure said to Lucky, \"Now then, what happened once you left Mimas?\" Lucky described his capture, and Devoure, having hinted at Sirius\u0027s possession of advanced mass-detection devices, said, \"And then, once on Titan, did you give us further information concerning your activities on Mimas?\" \"Yes, sir. I told you that another Councilman was still on Mimas, and then I accompanied you back to Mimas.\" This the delegates had apparently not known. There was a furor, which Devoure shouted down. He cried, \"I have a complete telephoto of the removal of the Councilman from Mimas, where he was sent to establish a secret war base against us at the very time that Earth called this conference, allegedly for peace.\u0027\u0027 Again the darkening and again the three-dimensional image. In full detail the conference watched the landing on Mimas, saw the surface melted down, watched Lucky disappear into the tunnel formed and Councilman Ben Wessilewsky brought up and on board ship. The last scenes were those taken within Wess\u0027s temporary quarters under the surface of Mimas. \"A fully equipped base, as you see,\" said Devoure. Then, turning to Lucky, he said, \"May your actions throughout all this be considered to have the official approval of Earth?\" It was a leading question and there was no doubt as to the answer that was desired and expected, but here Lucky hesitated, while the audience waited breathlessly and a frown gathered on Devoure\u0027s face. Finally Lucky said, \"I will tell the precise truth. I did not receive direct permission to re-enter Saturn a second time, but I know that in everything I did I would have met with the full approval of the Council of Science.\" And at that admission there was wild commotion among the reporters and a hubbub on the floor. The conference delegates were rising in their seats, and cries of \"Vote! Vote!\" could be made out. To all appearances the conference had ended and Earth had lost.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lucky-starr-and-the-rings-of-saturn-lucky-starr-6/page-16.html","bookId":1759,"book":{"id":1759,"title":"Lucky Starr And The Rings Of Saturn (Lucky Starr #6)","description":"Storyline: Lucky Starr and the Rings of Saturn (Lucky Starr #6) Earth officials were hard on the heels of the mysterious Sirian spy, Agent X, when he blasted off in a stolen spaceship.
