{"id":66546,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"46\n I padded downstairs barefoot, wearing only my pants. I took the call alone in the back office behind the reception counter, as before. It was Karla Dixon on the line. My old colleague. The financial wizard. She had been a founding member of the original 110th Special Unit. My second pick, after Frances Neagley. I guessed Stan Lowrey had passed on my question about money from Kosovo, and Dixon was calling back direct, to save time.\n I asked, \"Why did you have to say you were my fiancee?\"\n She asked back, \"Why, did I interrupt something?\"\n \"Not exactly. But she heard.\"\n \"Elizabeth Deveraux? Neagley told us about her. You two are getting it on already?\"\n \"And now I\u0027ve got some explaining to do.\"\n \"You need to take care there, Reacher.\"\n \"Neagley always thinks that.\"\n \"This time she\u0027s right. The sergeants\u0027 network is all lit up. Red hot. Deveraux is being checked out, big time.\"\n \"I know that,\" I said. \"Garber already told me. Waste of time.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. It all suddenly went quiet.\"\n \"Because there\u0027s nothing there.\"\n \"No, because there is. You know how bureaucracy works. It\u0027s easy to say no. Silence means yes.\"\n \"What would they find if they checked you out?\"\n \"Plenty.\"\n \"Or me?\"\n \"I hate to think.\"\n \"So there you go,\" I said. \"Nothing to worry about.\"\n \"Believe me, there\u0027s something wrong there, Reacher. I mean it. Maybe something real big. My advice would be to stay away from her.\"\n \"Too late for that. I don\u0027t buy it, anyway. She was a good little jarhead.\"\n \"Who told you that?\"\n \"She did.\"\n Silence on the line.\n I said, \"What else?\"\n Dixon said, \"There\u0027s no money coming out of Kosovo. None at all. Whoever\u0027s worrying about that is on a wild goose chase. It\u0027s not a factor.\"\n \"You sure?\"\n \"Completely.\"\n \"They\u0027re wondering if Joe is telling me anything.\"\n \"Wild goose chase,\" she said again. \"Treasury wouldn\u0027t know, anyway. Unless it was billions and billions. Which it isn\u0027t. It isn\u0027t even dollars and cents. It\u0027s nothing. Someone\u0027s panicking, that\u0027s all. They\u0027re thrashing around. They\u0027re looking for something that isn\u0027t there.\"\n \"OK, good to know,\" I said. \"Thanks.\"\n \"That was the good news,\" she said.\n \"What\u0027s the bad news?\"\n \"Related information,\" she said. \"A friend of a friend got into the Kosovo files, and they\u0027re plenty thick right now.\"\n \"With what?\"\n \"Among other things, two local women disappeared without a trace.\"\n Dixon told me that over the last year two Kosovan women had simply vanished. There was no local explanation. No family troubles. Both were unmarried. Both had been within range of the U.S. Army\u0027s local footprint. Both had fraternized.\n \"Girlfriend material,\" Dixon said.\n \"Good looking?\" I asked.\n \"I didn\u0027t see photographs.\"\n I asked, \"Was there an investigation?\"\n \"Under the radar,\" Dixon said. \"We\u0027re not there at all, remember, as far as the rest of the world is concerned. So they flew a guy in from Germany. Supposedly on his way to Italy for some NATO crap, but Kosovo was the real destination. The travel arrangements are still on file.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"As a patriotic American you\u0027ll be glad to hear that every last member of the U.S. armed forces was as innocent as a newborn baby. No crimes were committed by anyone in uniform.\"\n \"So the case was closed?\"\n \"Tighter than a trout\u0027s asshole.\"\n \"Who was the investigator?\"\n \"Major Duncan Munro.\"\n I finished the call with Dixon and went back upstairs. Deveraux wasn\u0027t in my room. I padded back to hers and found the door locked. I heard the shower running. I knocked but got no response. So I showered and dressed and went back fifteen minutes later and found nothing but silence. I walked up to the diner, but she wasn\u0027t there either. Her car was not in the department lot. So I just stood there on the sidewalk, with nowhere to go, and no one to talk to, and nothing to do, completely unaware that the hour that would change everything had just ticked down from sixty minutes to fifty-nine.\n 47\n I loitered on the sidewalk for half of that hour. Mostly I leaned on a wall and didn\u0027t move. A professional skill. Necessary in my line of work. I\u0027m good at it. But I know people who are better. I know people who have waited hours or days or weeks for something to happen.\n I was waiting for the old guy with the tape measure to show up and open the shirt shop. Which he did, eventually. I pushed off my wall and crossed the street and followed him inside. He fussed with locks and lights and I made straight for his pile of button-downs. I found the same thing I was wearing and took it to the counter.\n The old guy said, \"Stocking up?\"\n I said, \"No, the first one got dirty.\"\n He leaned in and peered at my pocket. I saw his eyes trace the curl of blood. Down and up. He said, \"I\u0027m sure that would wash out. Cold water, maybe a little salt.\"\n \"Salt?\"\n \"Salt helps with bloodstains. With cold water. Hot water sets them.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think the Toussaint\u0027s hotel offers a very sophisticated laundry service,\" I said. \"Actually I don\u0027t think they offer any kind of laundry service at all. They don\u0027t even offer coffee in the lounge.\"\n \"You could take the shirt home with you, sir.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Well, in your suitcase.\"\n \"Easier just to replace it.\"\n \"But that would be very expensive.\"\n \"Compared to what? How much do suitcases cost?\"\n \"But you would keep a suitcase forever. You would use it over and over again for many years.\"\n I said, \"I think I\u0027ll just take the new shirt. No need to wrap it.\"\n I paid the guy and then ducked into his changing cubicle and pulled the curtain. I took off the old shirt, put on the new, and came back out.\n \"Got a trash can?\" I asked.\n The guy paused a beat in surprise and then ducked down and came back up with a knee-high metal canister. He held it out uncertainly. I balled up the dirty shirt and hit a three-pointer from about ten feet. The guy looked horrified. Then I headed back across the street to the diner for breakfast. And for a little more purposeful loitering. I knew my best chance of running into Deveraux would be right there. A woman who ate like she did couldn\u0027t stay away for long. It was just a matter of time.\n In the end it was a matter of less than twenty minutes. I ate eggs and was halfway through my third cup of coffee when she came in. She saw me from the doorway and paused. The whole world paused. The atmosphere went solid. She was in uniform again, and her hair was tied back. Her face was a little set in place. A little immobile. She looked wonderful.\n I took a breath and kicked the facing chair out. She didn\u0027t react. I saw her eyes move as she considered her options. She looked at all the tables. Most of them were unoccupied. But evidently she decided that to sit on her own might cause a scene. She was worried about voters. Worried about her reputation. So she came over to me. She pulled the chair out another foot and sat down, quiet and reserved, knees tight together, hands in her lap.\n I said, \"I don\u0027t have a fiancee. I don\u0027t have any kind of other girlfriend.\"\n She didn\u0027t answer.\n I said, \"It was just an MP colleague on the phone. They\u0027re all playing a game with the undercover thing. Apparently it amuses them. My CO calls himself my uncle.\"\n No answer.\n \"I can\u0027t prove a negative,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m hungry,\" she said. \"This is the first time in two years I\u0027ve missed breakfast.\"\n \"I apologize for that,\" I said.\n \"Why? There\u0027s no need, if what you\u0027re saying is true.\"\n \"It is true. I\u0027m apologizing on behalf of my colleague.\"\n \"Was it your sergeant? Neagley?\"\n \"No, it was a woman called Karla Dixon.\"\n \"What did she want?\"\n \"To tell me that no one is running a financial scam out of Fort Kelham.\"\n \"How would she know?\"\n \"She knows everything about anything with a dollar sign in front of it.\"\n \"Who thought there was a financial scam out of Kelham?\"\n \"The brass. I suppose it was a theoretical possibility. Like you said, they\u0027re desperate.\"\n \"If you had a fiancee, would you cheat on her?\"\n \"Probably not,\" I said. \"But I\u0027d want to, with you.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been burned before.\"\n \"Hard to believe.\"\n \"Yet true. Not a good feeling.\"\n \"I understand,\" I said. \"But you weren\u0027t being burned last night.\"\n She went quiet. I saw her thinking. Last night. She waved to the waitress and ordered French toast. The same as the day before.\n \"I called Bruce Lindsay,\" she said. \"Shawna Lindsay\u0027s little brother. Did you know they have a phone?\"\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve used it. Karla Dixon was returning a call I made from it.\"\n \"I\u0027m heading over there this afternoon. I think you\u0027re right. He has something to tell me.\"\n Me. Not us.\n I said, \"It was a fellow officer\u0027s lame joke. That\u0027s all.\"\n She said, \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s a problem with the fingerprints. From Janice Chapman\u0027s house, I mean. My own fault, as a matter of fact.\"\n \"What kind of problem?\"\n \"Deputy Butler has a friend over there at the Jackson PD. From back when he took the course. I encourage him to get her to do our processing for us, on the quiet, to save ourselves the money. We don\u0027t have the budget here. But Butler\u0027s friend screwed up this time, and I can\u0027t ask him to ask her to do it over. That would be a step too far.\"\n \"Screwed up how?\"\n \"She got her file numbers mixed. Chapman\u0027s data went to a case about a woman called Audrey Shaw, and we got Audrey Shaw\u0027s data. The wrong person entirely. Some kind of federal government worker. Which Chapman definitely wasn\u0027t, because there\u0027s no federal government work here, and Chapman didn\u0027t work anyway. Unless Audrey Shaw was the previous owner of Chapman\u0027s house, in which case it was Butler\u0027s own screw-up, looking for prints in the wrong places, or yours, for letting him.\"\n \"No, Butler did a good job,\" I said. \"He looked in all the right places. Those prints weren\u0027t from a previous owner, not unless she sneaked back in and used Chapman\u0027s toothbrush in the middle of the night. So it\u0027s just one of those things, I guess. Shit happens.\"\n \"Tell me again,\" she said. \"About that phone call.\"\n \"It was Major Karla Dixon of the 329th,\" I said. \"With information for me. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"And the fiancee thing was a joke?\"\n \"Don\u0027t tell me the Marines are better comedians, too.\"\n \"Is she good looking?\"\n \"Pretty nice.\"\n \"Was she ever your girlfriend?\"\n \"No.\"\n Deveraux went quiet again. I could see a decision coming. It was almost there. And I was pretty sure it was going to turn out OK. But I didn\u0027t find out. Not right then. Because before she could speak again the stout woman from the department\u0027s switchboard room crashed in through the diner door and stopped dead with one hand on the knob and one on the jamb. She was out of breath. She was panting. Her chest was heaving. She had run all the way. She called out, \"There\u0027s another one.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-affair-jack-reacher-16/page-16.html","bookId":2349,"book":{"id":2349,"title":"The Affair (Jack Reacher #16)","description":"Storyline: \n The Affair (Jack Reacher #16) \n March 1997.
