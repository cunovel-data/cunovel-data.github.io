{"id":80271,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\u0027Fires!\u0027 Peder Szekarly gasped. His young eyes were that much sharper, keener. \u0027And some movement down there, close to the Gate. See, the sudden blazing up casts shadows. But things that big ... can only be warriors!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The Wamphyri are camped there, aye,\u0027 Lardis\u0027s eyes had narrowed under the frowning overhang of his brow. The Lords, their flyers, their warriors. But why are they leaving it so late? Sunup is coming. They should be heading for Karenstack, before the first rays strike through the great pass. What\u0027s their business down there, so close to the sphere Gate?\u0027 He screwed up his eyes, vainly trying to make out those details which distance had forbidden them. Vainly, and perhaps mercifully, too.\\n\\n \u0027Look\u0027\u0027 Kirk Lisescu\u0027s voice was no more than a tremor in the gradually brightening air. They saw where he pointed: the timber-line some hundreds of feet below their vantage point, but full of motion now as The Dweller\u0027s entire wolf pack came bounding in a silent flood up through the trees! They headed for the high crags, headed west, headed in any direction as long as it was away from the Gate, the Wamphyri, and their bonfires!\\n\\n \u0027Now what -?\u0027 Andrei began - but Lardis grasped his arm and shut him off.\\n\\n \u0027Get down!\u0027 Lardis gasped, hurling himself out from under the tree\u0027s sparse branches and diving behind upthrusting crags. The seer in him had surfaced at last; he knew that whatever was coming ... was already on its way!\\n\\n As a single, brilliant, prolonged flash of lightning lit the peaks, so Andrei and Kirk joined Lardis where he crouched down, hugging the naked rock. And as thunder played a booming, lingering drum-roll across the sky, so the three heard Peder Szekarly\u0027s croaked question: \u0027But what is it?\u0027 Peder had been the last to leave the gnarled tree; he made no attempt to seek cover; he stood trembling, looking down on Starside through a jagged gap in the rocks.\\n\\n From where Lardis crouched, he couldn\u0027t see Peder, didn\u0027t know that his young friend stood exposed. \u0027I don\u0027t know what it is,\u0027 he finally answered, \u0027but I saw it - felt it - like a burst of brilliant light, searing my eyes, my soul!\u0027\\n\\n The lightning?\u0027 Peder didn\u0027t understand.\\n\\n At last Lardis looked up and saw him standing there, and knew that the thing of his premonition, whatever, was almost upon them! \u0027Peder, get down!\u0027 he cried.\\n\\n Too late.\\n\\n Down on Starside\u0027s boulder plain, the sphere Gate disappeared in a LIGHT which ate it in a moment, a light to sear a man\u0027s eyes, his soul, as Lardis had said. But it was much more than that, more powerful than that, more terrible than that. In the smallest fraction of a second it leaped the gap between and shone on Peder. Only for a moment, but long enough. Smoke leapt from him. He screamed, clutched at his face, tottered back away from the gap in the rocks. Even as he stumbled, a giant\u0027s hand seemed to slap at him, hurling him down!\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n In the next moment there commenced such a howling of torn earth, riven rock, crazed winds ... it was like the combined hissing, mewling, and bellowing of every warrior the Wamphyri had ever spawned! And as the sky turned red over Starside and the frightened clouds went scurrying, so Lardis looked out - because he had to know, had to see.\\n\\n And what he saw ...!\\n\\n It was as if something of the hell-lands themselves had erupted through the sphere Gate. Which was as close to the truth as Lardis or anyone else might ever guess, except perhaps a handful of men a universe away, who knew the truth in its entirety.\\n\\n For the Gate itself was no longer visible, only a mighty mushroom of frothy white and dirty grey, shot through with red and orange fires, boiling for the sky. Already its billowing dome towered high as the mountains, and even now its stem was leaning towards the Icelands, as if bowed down by the weight of its roiling head.\\n\\n Lardis\u0027s jaw fell open; he mouthed unheard, unremembered things into the warm wind off Starside, that demon breath which whipped his hair back and hurled hot grit in his face. And as the furnace blast died away he shielded his eyes against the tracery of lightnings that leaped and crackled between the incredible mushroom and the boiling earth.\\n\\n Then, hearing Andrei and Kirk calling to him, he pulled himself together and went to them where they crouched beside Peder. Miraculously, the youth had closed his eyes in the moment of the fireball; though the skin of his face, neck, hands was badly seared, his sight was returning with each passing second. Clutching at his leader\u0027s hand, he gasped, \u0027Lardis, Lardis! It was ... it was -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 Lardis nodded. \u0027It was hell!\u0027\\n\\n Later, Peder\u0027s hair would fall out and his gums and fingernails bleed, and when his face grew new skin it would always be white. But at least he would seem to recover, for a while, and be the whole man again. However that might be, he would die six years later, by which time his appearance would be as grey and gnarly as the aspect of an ancient. Nor would there be heirs to survive him ...\\n\\n In the wild woods to the west of Settlement, in the predawn silence of sunup, old Jasef Karis had dreamed his last dream and now tried to rouse himself, shake himself awake, stand up. But something was desperately wrong; his arms hurt as if they were cramped, and there was a grinding pain in his chest. It was as much as he could do to open his eyes.\\n\\n Above him, Jasef saw the oiled skin which Nana had draped over low branches like an awning, to keep the dawn rains from his wrinkled hide. Except he\u0027d rolled to one side in his sleep and so lay uncovered, drenched and shivering. The way he felt - hot on the inside, cold out, yet sweating from the pain of the thing in his chest - he suspected that the dawn light in the green canopy overhead would be the last he\u0027d ever see. It must be the end of him, yes, for he had never felt like this before and didn\u0027t much want to feel it again.\\n\\n But first he must tell someone about his dream. He must tell... Nana, of course!\\n\\n His dream. His dream of -\\n\\n - A corpse, smouldering, with its lire-blackened arms flung wide, steaming head thrown back as in the final agony of death, tumbling end over end into a black void shot through with thin neon bars or ribbons of blue, green, and red light; indeed descending or retreating into this tunnel of streamers. A tortured thing, yes, but dead now from all of its torments and no longer suffering, unknown and unknowable as the weird things of dreams often are. And yet... there had been something morbidly familiar about it, so that Jasef had wished he could look closer at that endlessly rotating, silently screaming, scorched and blistered face.\\n\\n And when his dream had drifted him closer - then Jasef had seen, and finally he had known. Had known who, and believed he also knew what.\\n\\n After that: The corpse\u0027s gyrating flight into eternity - through this alien continuum of green, blue and crimson bars -had speeded up, leaving Jasef behind. But then, in the moment after the thing had sped away and disappeared -\\n\\n - An explosion of golden light in the distant haze, where the corpse had been! And a rush of golden splinters like living darts, speeding towards Jasef and past him, each blinking out as it escaped out of this unknowable place into other, more real times and places.\u0027\\n\\n That was when the scene had changed: To Nona\u0027s four-year-old twins, wrapped together in a blanket under a tree, with a roof of oiled skins just like Josef\u0027s to keep the rain off. And suddenly - appearing out of nowhere - one of the golden darts, which hovered undecided, first over one twin and then the other. At which the pair stirred in their sleep, which had seemed to decide the matter. Hissing his horror, Jasef had seen the dart lance down, to enter into the head of one of them! Except there was no scar, no blood, nothing but a smile spreading on the face of the sleeping innocent!\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And: \u0027Innocent?\u0027 Jasef had wondered, like a memory from some earlier dream, some previous time. \u0027Still innocent?\u0027\\n\\n Which was when he had awakened, or tried to, only to discover himself bound by these pains like tight thongs across his chest and limbs. But he knew now that indeed he was awake, and also that he must pass on his dream, his vision, while yet he might.\\n\\n He tried to call out for Nana, and couldn\u0027t, for the pain wouldn\u0027t let him. His cry came out the merest gasp. Well then, and so he must simply lie here and listen to the first birds calling, and wait until Nana came to him.\\n\\n But he hoped she wouldn\u0027t keep him waiting too long ...\\n\\n Only a moment earlier, Nana Kiklu had woken up. But she was some little distance away and so failed to hear Jasef\u0027s gasping. There had been a noise - the dull, distant booming of thunder, perhaps? - and a little later one of the twins had come tottering, rubbing at his eyes, on the point of tears. Obviously he\u0027d been nightmaring, or else would not have left his bed for his mother\u0027s. Small as they were, Nana\u0027s twins preferred sleeping alone.\\n\\n Pulling him down under her blanket, giving him her warmth, Nana had comforted him: \u0027Oh, dear! There, there,\u0027 and stroked his hair. Then, still half-asleep, she\u0027d automatically fumbled for the small leather strap he wore on his left wrist. It was Nana\u0027s way of identifying her babies in the dead of night: Nestor\u0027s was a plain band, a simple strip of leather joined with a few strong stitches, while Nathan\u0027s band had a half-twist. Now, recognizing the child as he snuggled closer, feeling the pounding of his little heart, she asked:\\n\\n \u0027What was it, eh?\u0027 She hugged him closer still. \u0027A dream? A bad dream?\u0027\\n\\n The forest was waking up; the birds were filling the air with their dawn chorus; light came down in hazy beams through the trees. Sunup, and all was well. And yet ... something felt wrong. It was in Nana\u0027s bones: a gnawing ache, a nagging concern. But for what?\\n\\n \u0027Mama?\u0027 The child in her arms was almost back to sleep.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My ... my daddy ...\u0027 he said. And that was something he\u0027d never said before.\\n\\n \u0027Shhh!\u0027 she said. \u0027Shhh!\u0027 And to herself, perhaps a little bitterly: Your daddy\u0027s on Starside, asJeep in the arms of the Lady Karen, where they hide from the light of the new day.\\n\\n \u0027Dead,\u0027 the child mumbled, where he snuggled to her breast. One word, but such a word! It filled Nana\u0027s veins with ice.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 she questioned him. \u0027Dead? Is something dead?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is he?\u0027 came the not-quite-awake question-answer, freezing her blood anew. \u0027Is he - my daddy - dead?\u0027\\n\\n Nana knew she wouldn\u0027t sleep again and so got up. There in the dawn glade she found Jasef Karis sprawled on his back, eyes glazed, dew dripping from his cold nose, and believed she now understood what her small son had tried to tell her. He had not been talking about the daddy he\u0027d never known (and couldn\u0027t possibly know), but the old seer, the old mentalist, Jasef.\\n\\n But far to the east and across the peaks, an omen!\\n\\n The boiling sky over Starside was black, and the bellies of its clouds flickered red with reflected fires ...\\n\\n PART TWO:\\n\\n Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\\n\\n Looking Further Back, and Scanning Forward\\n\\n 1\\n\\n This much has been told: Shaitan, first of the Wamphyri, remembered neither mother nor father, nor yet understood his own genesis. To him it was as if he had simply sprung into being, full grown, with a will but no memories of his own to mention. Following which he had fallen, or been thrown, to earth; but fallen, on this occasion, to \u0027earth\u0027 as opposed to Earth. In any event, he discovered himself upon the surface of one of many worlds, in one of the many universes of light. And dimly (and quickly fading in the eye of his mind), he remembered something of ... of an expulsion.\\n\\n The world into which he had fallen was in one sense an old world, and in another a new one. Recently it had suffered calamity: a Black Hole, losing most of its mass and deteriorating to a Grey Hole, had likewise fallen out of space and time and settled here, reshaping the planet. But where that had been a calculable disaster, the disaster which was Shaitan would be quite incalculable.\\n\\n From him would spring an order of beings whose nature was such as to threaten not one but two worlds, filling the myths and legends of both with dread and uttermost horror. For Shaitan was a vampire.\\n\\n And yet, when he fell (or was thrown out), he was not yet a vampire. That was still to come: a matter of choice, of exercising his own free will, his human curiosity. And this is how it came about...\\n\\n Starting into awareness, Shaitan cried out...!\\n\\n It was the shock of consciousness cloaking an intelligence previously bereft, will without knowledge inhabiting a mind wiped clean. And as his cry echoed into silence, so he discovered himself kneeling at the edge of stagnant water, with his naked image mirrored in scummy depths. But seeing that he was beautiful, he was proud.\\n\\n Standing upright, Shaitan saw that he could walk; and in the twilight of a dim, misty dawn he moved by the edge of the dank, rank waters, which were a swamp. And seeing how dismal and lonely was this world where he had fallen, or into which he had been cast, he assumed himself a sinner and that the place must be his punishment.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Such assumptions defined not only Shaitan\u0027s intelligence but also his nature: that he instinctively understood such concepts as sin and punishment. And he thought his crime must be that he was beautiful, which was his pride working ... which was in fact his crime! For he saw beauty as might, and might as right, and right as he willed it to be.\\n\\n Which was a will he would impose.\\n\\n So thinking, Shaitan moved away from the rank waters and went to impose his will upon this world. But behind him the mud boiled and spattered, so that he paused to look back where black bubbles came bursting to the surface. And with the parting of the weeds and the scum, Shaitan saw a figure floating up into view.\\n\\n In its body it was bloated and burned, but its face was almost whole. And in that face was an innocence beyond comprehension. Shaitan knew it for an omen, but of what? He had will; he could wait and discover what would be, or move on, according to his will. Also, he suspected that this thing in the swamp harboured evil; why else would such a blackened, blistered thing be here, in this emerging dawn world? For again it was Shaitan\u0027s instinct to know that all things are balanced, and that for any measure of good there may be an equal measure of evil.\\n\\n For a moment he stood still, as at a crossroads, then ... turned back and knelt again beside the swamp. For his will was that he would know this evil.\\n\\n He gazed upon a face he had never known, which he would not recall to memory for numberless years, and sensed nothing of moment except that he tempted fate, which he was proud and glad to do. And as the beasts of this dawn world came to the water to drink, and as the mists were drawn up from the swamp, so the Fallen One, Shaitan the Unborn, gazed upon his own future where the weeds anchored it in scum and slime.\\n\\n In a while the scorched, bloated limbs and trunk of the corpse split open and small black mushrooms clustered there, growing out of the rotting flesh and opening their gilled caps. They released red spores into the twilight before the dawn, which rose up and drifted on the warm reek of the swamp. Shaitan saw the clouds of drifting spores, and of his own free will breathed them into his lungs, the better to know of them... his last act of any innocence -\\n\\n - At least in this incarnation.\\n\\n All of this has been told before. What follows has not been told: it is the tale of Shaitan\u0027s travels and travails, his triumphs and torments from this time forwards ...\\n\\n Shaitan travelled east through the foothills of gradually rising mountains. He sought for that thing or those things upon which to impose his will. The swamps had not been to his liking, nor the boggy region between the swamps and the foothills. The creatures of these places, while seeming largely unintelligent, had yet been wary to a fault!\\n\\n Sunlight had first come streaming, then blasting from the south, where a golden orb had climbed gradually into the sky to commence a low, slow arc eastwards. Its rays had dried out the land around and lured clinging fogs up from the sodden earth. In those places where there was little or no shade, the yellow rays had irritated Shaitan, reddening and roughening his skin.\\n\\n After that - forever after that, in every way - he would always walk in the shadows. And just as he chose to stay on the left-hand side of the mountains, away from the sun, so would he choose a dark and sinistral path through life. He did not know it but he had ever chosen that route, even in worlds before this one.\\n\\n When Shaitan was thirsty, he drank. The sweet water quenched his thirst but there was no satisfaction in it. When he hungered, he ate grasses, herbs, fruits. They filled him but ... the hunger remained. Within his body a red spore had taken root, forming the nucleus of that which had hungers of its own.\\n\\n He was unclothed but unashamed. Knowing that he was beautiful, he would display himself; except he would prefer to make himself known to others of his own design, made more nearly in his mould. For the creatures of the swamps and foothills were other than he was and innocent, so that all of them had fled before him. Therefore, he was unable to impose his will upon them, because of their innocence.\\n\\n And so Shaitan journeyed east across a land where the northern sky was dark blue to black and full of the flicker of stars and the cold weave of weird auroras; but always in the south the golden orb of the sun blazed perilously in the pale blue heavens, so that he must keep himself to the shadows in order not to be burned. And he called all of the land lying to the south of the foothills \u0027Sunside\u0027, despising it greatly, and all the land to the north \u0027Starside\u0027, claiming it for his own. And where finally the foothills grew into mountains like a wall on his right hand, shutting out the sun\u0027s harmful rays, there Shaitan discovered creatures which were not afraid of him but merely curious - at first.\\n\\n For Shaitan\u0027s part, he was likewise curious, even astonished. These creatures were not human, yet seemed full of an almost-human purpose and intelligence. They communicated among themselves, however witlessly, in a near-inaudible range which Shaitan sensed rather than heard (for the spore-spawned Thing within him was growing, and causing a strange intensification of his five mundane senses ...). They were small, lowly, weak creatures, which yet commanded aerial flight: a skill far in excess of Shaitan\u0027s own meagre, as yet unformed talents.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And when he saw their aerial agility he scowled and was jealous of them; for it seemed to Shaitan that upon a time he too had flown - but with such authority and in such places as to put all the best efforts of these small creatures to shame! Why, if only he could will it, he would fly again, right here and now, and show them how it was done!\\n\\n ... Except, having physical limitations, it was beyond the power of his will. He could not will it. Not yet...\\n\\n But while Shaitan envied them, in some small part he also admired these children of the twilight, the night, the velvet darkness, and chose them for his familiars. And when he called out to them with his mind, he saw that they heeded him and hastened to his beck; for they knew that they were his. But these were only the small cousins of greater creatures, who likewise \u0027heard\u0027 Shaitan\u0027s mind-calls from the shadows of Starside; and when they also came to swerve and dip about him, crying out with their shrill voices, then his pride was great. For he saw that indeed he had imposed his will upon all the bats of this world.\\n\\n They were his first conquests; he enjoyed his triumph, however small; other victories would follow in short order.\\n\\n Always heading east, Shaitan ate sparingly of tasteless berries gathered on the border of the swamps and in the foothills. Where streams trickled down from the heights, there he would drink, though the brackish water was never to his taste. And before sleeping, he had learned to gather in unto himself his bat minions great and small, for their warmth; so that he quickly became expert in their habits.\\n\\n The smaller bats were insectivores; their greater cousins . .. drank blood! Which seemed only right to Shaitan: that small life-forms should sustain themselves by devouring even smaller forms, and greater life-forms by devouring ... why, the very source of life itself! And he believed he now understood his personal dissatisfaction with the common fare of wild animals. Berries, fruits, grasses? What sort of foods were they for one such as him? Water? What was that for a drink? And:\\n\\n \u0027No, no!\u0027 Shaitan now promised himself. \u0027I\u0027ll have no more of them. They are for the hooved beasts and the scuttling foragers of this world. But for me ... the blood is the life!\u0027 And within him (however vacuously, instinctively) the as yet embryonic spore-creature exulted, for it was or would be of a like mind and nature.\\n\\n Beyond the mountains the sun sank down; the last yellow glints vanished even from the highest peaks; the stars shone that much brighter in the north and spread themselves like a sprinkling of jewels all across the domed vault of the sky. A breathless moon raced on high, begging of the wild ones in the mountains their adulation. Eerie wolf voices echoed up into the night of Starside, and Shaitan was impressed by the howling of the hunting packs.\\n\\n And again he reached out his growing vampire awareness to contact and impose his will upon them, even as he had instructed the bats. Except these creatures shied from such contact. For while they were untamed, still they were of a high order of organized intelligence - far higher than the bats - and suspicious; and anyway they had their own leaders, who were jealous of their sovereignty.\\n\\n \u0027Dogs!\u0027 Shaitan called them then, snarling his frustration at them and abusing them with his mind-voice. Which was why (in this world at least), total domination of the wolves by the Wamphyri never came to pass. Later generations of vampires, all springing from Shaitan, might occasionally produce a Lord who would master or befriend this or that lone wolf, but in the main the grey brothers would retain their lupine integrity ...\\n\\n Then, three hundred miles along the north-western fringe of the barrier range of mountains, there Shaitan came across his first tribe of men or sub-men. Aboriginal even before the advent of the Grey Hole - grey and leathery, cavern-dwelling, slow-moving and -thinking -now, in the seventh century of aftermath, the trogs were grown truly primitive. Highly photophobic, they took to their caves at sunup, came out to hunt at sundown. They lived mainly on the grubs of a species of giant moth with a wingspan wide as a man\u0027s hand, on mushrooms, and on small bats which they netted and roasted. But still they were men; they understood and used fire, and had a language of their own. And as such they made perfect subjects for the imposition of Shaitan\u0027s will.\\n\\n This is how it was: He saw a group of them bring down a tawny mountain cat which had strayed down on to the Starside levels. They netted the animal, clubbed it unconscious, finished the job with bone knives. And as they set about to skin it, so Shaitan emerged from the shadows of a boulder where he had rested, coming upon them suddenly. They saw him and their jaws fell open. For while they were not conscious of their own ugliness, Shaitan\u0027s beauty was inescapable.\\n\\n He stood before them, naked and proud in starshine, and his appearance - springing up out of nowhere like this - was next to magical. Tall and straight, where the trogs were hunched and shambling, smiling in his darkly sardonic way, where they could only gawp and gabble, he was like a ray of light fallen among shadows. Which was entirely contrary to the fact, for he was the Great Corrupter come among innocents.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And as they came forward to examine him, so Shaitan stood still and suffered their timid touchings and awed, astonished exclamations. He listened attentively to their language, for it had dawned on him that his own (as yet largely untried) was very rudimentary, a vague string of sounds left over from ... from when? From what? He could not say, except that he felt his few words to be the fading echoes of many tongues; but he knew that the ability was in him to learn and use all tongues. For he was able, however dimly, to see into the minds of men and creatures alike, from which it is the very smallest step to tie pictures to the spoken words.\\n\\n \u0027It is un-man!\u0027 one of the trogs reported of Shaitan to his companions. \u0027Its skin is soft, pale, easily broken.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Its eyes are blue, not yellow,\u0027 another pointed out. \u0027Yet they see in the dark like ours.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Blue, yes,\u0027 grunted a third. \u0027But in their cores ... is that a fire burning behind them? From time to time, his eyes burn!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is ... a man!\u0027 said the first. \u0027Not unlike the men beyond the mountains, who live in the light - and yet, not like them.\u0027\\n\\n And another, perhaps wiser trog desired to know: \u0027But is he a friend?\u0027\\n\\n Shaitan\u0027s guile was great; first he would be friend, then master. \u0027I am what I am,\u0027 he told them, \u0027and I have come to show you the way.\u0027\\n\\n They shambled back from him, in awe of their own language slipping so easily from Shaitan\u0027s lips. But in a little while the wise one told him: \u0027We know all of the ways. We are born, we wax, we hunt and forage for food, we make young ones. Then we die and leave our young to do as we have done. These are the ways.\u0027\\n\\n At which Shaitan smiled and nodded. \u0027But there are other ways,\u0027 he told them. And from within, for the first time, he heard a voice which was not his voice, saying: These shall be yours.\u0027 The voice of his conscience (or lack of it), or of something else? At any rate, Shaitan was not troubled. But seeing the mountain cat lying there red and gleaming and shorn of its skin did trouble him. And again, as from within: The blood is the life!\\n\\n And taking a knife from one of the trogs, he cut himself a portion from the hind leg of the slaughtered beast and squatted down to eat his fill. And as the trogs gathered round him, one of them said: \u0027See, he eats his meat raw!\u0027\\n\\n And another: \u0027His smile is beautiful!\u0027\\n\\n And a third, the one who had made previous mention of Shaitan\u0027s eyes: \u0027And where is the blue of his eyes now? Gone, as if the blood of the beast had flowed into them!\u0027\\n\\n Which was true in more ways than one ...\\n\\n Shaitan lived a while with the trogs and learned their ways. They showed him those cavern mushrooms which were edible, but he would not eat them. They showed him those that were deadly poison, which he must not eat. And later, taking meat with the tribal elder (the wise one of the first meeting; who was wary of him and his new ways), Shaitan put what he had learned to use. The wise one died in agony, and Shaitan took his place.\\n\\n The tribe was small, its people ugly of form and countenance, its caverns smoky and full of stenches. Shaitan quickly became disenchanted. He would instruct these people in ... oh, in diverse ways, but their capacity for learning was small. He would open their eyes, take away their childlike innocence and replace it with ... what? Again he was not sure, except that he desired to impose his will. But to what end? Existence with the sub-men was severely limited and limiting.\\n\\n Shaitan was full of vice. He had a man\u0027s passions, lusts, desires; and all enhanced, multiplied by the developing thing within him. He detested the trog women, yet gathered together a harem of all their ripest. When an enraged young male protested the theft of his prospective mate, Shaitan castrated him and made him the eunuch overseer of his carnal chambers. When a group of trogs rose up against him to kill him, he hid in a cave where he trembled and sweated ... and his sweat formed a mist that hid him from view and frightened his vengeful enemies away. They ran off to other tribes, spreading Shaitan\u0027s legend abroad.\\n\\n He practised arts which were instinct in him, for he knew that he was corrupt in all his parts. And bleeding himself with ticks, he used them to contaminate the storehouses of the trogs until their food seethed with his evil. More of the sub-men ran off, while yet they were unblemished. As for those who stayed: they were sick now in mind and body and called Shaitan master, and followed in his footsteps. Of all Wamphyri thralls, they were the first.\\n\\n Shaitan planted seed in his women and several brought forth. Such offspring as were produced were hideous, scarlet-eyed, shrieking . .. and hungry. They suckled blood from their mothers\u0027 paps and grew too fast. And their own mothers smothered them, all but one which Shaitan ate ... Until finally he had had enough of the cave-dwellers, for he knew that there was flesh in this world other than the lowly flesh of trogs.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And always his parasite guided him, living on his blood as he lived on the blood of others. It was a very subtle symbiosis, however, so that except in Shaitan\u0027s darkest dreams and certain rare waking moments, he believed he was the sole author of his affairs and master of his own will and destiny. But ... he could never be sure. And from that time forward the question of free will, self-determination, and all connected theories of integrity of spirit, became matters of vast importance to Shaitan, even assuming dimensions of obsession in him. In him, and in all subsequent vampires ...\\n\\n Shaitan remembered how, in his first meeting with the trogs, they had likened him to men on the other side of the barrier mountains. Now (having almost forgotten the irritation of the sun\u0027s golden rays, and with only one way to test for a recurrence of the problem), he determined the conquest of Sunside. But it would be subtle, as were all his works. First he would approach the Sunsiders as a friend, and later as their master. Thus it would be as it had been with the trogs.\\n\\n So thought Shaitan ...\\n\\n Leaving his trog thralls behind to fend for themselves, he climbed the mountains diagonally, heading east as always. He climbed at sunup but was shielded from the sun by the wall of the mountains. Still the sky\u0027s brightness troubled him and the light hurt his vampire eyes, so that he wondered if all of this world\u0027s creatures were photophobic, himself included. But high over the tree-line and into the peaks, he saw great birds soaring on high, which were not bothered by the sun. They were birds of prey, kites, which scoured the land for food in the last rays of the sun. Also, there were great shaggy goats in the peaks, which had no fear of the light, and likewise small creatures in the coarse grasses and heather.\\n\\n Shaitan shrugged. Well, he would put his theories to the test soon enough; indeed, he might even impose his will upon the sun! (At which the spore-grown vampire inside him shrank down and was small, for in this matter Shaitan was too wilful and his vampire could neither guide nor control him. Immature in its own right, it must simply go along with him.) While for his part Shaitan felt merely uneasy, as a result of his parasite\u0027s concern.\\n\\n As fate would have it, he crested the mountains in that hour when all that remained of the sun was a spoked wheel of pink and yellow light fanning the southern horizon, and so felt no discomfort. And the gradually developing thing inside Shaitan, which was now irreversibly part of him, relaxed somewhat. For after all, it could feel the power of its host and knew that he was strong.\\n\\n And as twilight turned to night, Shaitan saw the flickering fires of hunters where they camped on the flank of the mountains. While down on the Sunside levels, the glowing fires of their camps and settlements lit the night in all directions, as far as his eyes could see. Their tribes were legion!\\n\\n And in his heart Shaitan was glad, believing that at last he had found true men upon whom to impose his will...\\n\\n The Sunsiders as a race of men were still recovering from the Grey Hole\u0027s holocaust, which had reshaped their \u0027Earth\u0027, realigned its orbit, and redesigned its geological features. They were recovering from earthquakes and tidal waves, from seasons of torrential rains and whirlwinds of black frozen ash (which in another world might well have been termed \u0027nuclear winters\u0027), and from other seasons which had baked half of the planet to a desert while the other half lay cold and wasted, mainly under frozen oceans. But as a race they were recovering, and gradually rebuilding their decimated numbers.\\n\\n Upon a time: \u0027Earth\u0027 had had continents, oceans, islands, seasons of winds, sun, rains, snow. It had species galore, and a quarter billion of people. They had the wheel, used fire and sails, experimented with rudimentary medicines and coarse chemistry. While gunpowder had not yet been discovered, still they understood the basic elements of the forge and of metalworking; they had metal tools, and the crossbow for hunting. And all in all theirs had seemed a bright future, whose explorers sailed out across the seas in wooden ships to seek new lands.\\n\\n But that was before the Grey Hole. And now, seven hundred or more years later, in the time of Shaitan? This is what the Sunsiders - less than thirty thousand of them now - knew of their world: That it had been ravaged of most of its species along with its peoples, and might well be considered dead except in that temperate zone whose spine was the barrier range of mountains between Sunside and Star-side. And in their legends (which were confused and contradictory, because the written form of their language had been at best basic and was lost in the aftermath, so that history had become a thing passed down immemorially by word of mouth), the scourge which had visited itself upon them to destroy their world had become synonymous with a forbidden place on Starside known only as \u0027the Gate to the hell-lands\u0027.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And the legend was this: that one night a strange \u0027white sun\u0027 had appeared in the southern skies ... a portent of terrible times in the offing!\\n\\n At first it had seemed to move slowly, like a comet, then more swiftly, and finally in a rush like a bar of white light where it speared down out of space to glance off the moon and blaze across the surface of the world! But as it fell to earth so it shimmered and shrank, until it skimmed across the land like a huge flat stone bouncing on water; and at last it thudded down into a crater of its own making, on a world gone mad by reason of its coming. Not a shooting star or a comet, no, but a Force far greater than these whose occurrence in Nature is mercifully rare: a Black Hole which had eaten itself, until only the event horizon remained. A Grey Hole now, and a bridge between universes.\\n\\n In any case, such science was beyond the people of this world. To the handful of stumbling, stunned survivors it was sufficient - and more than sufficient - that a deadly white sun had fallen out of the sky and destroyed everything they had known, leaving them and their descendants to live through a sort of hell for more than two and a half centuries. Until eventually, as the planet\u0027s orbit stabilized and its climates polarized -however dramatically - all that was left of humanity dwelled as best they might in the narrow belts of forest and on the plains south of the great barrier range, and in the southern flanks of the mountains themselves.\\n\\n And now, whenever hunters climbed those mountains in their central region, or strayed through the great pass to Starside\u0027s boulder plains, they saw how an awful revenant of the cataclysm yet survived to reinforce its legend: a crater socket with its sunken, blind white eye glaring up and out, as if some fallen demon lay paralysed, unblinking, and wondering at his lot. And the gaze of his cold, dead white eye was like a beacon, a forbidding pharos, not guiding but warning souls away ...\\n\\n A demon, yes, why not? Something from hell, anyway. Something which had brought hell here with it.\\n\\n And in the legends there was also the story of a wandering adventurer, first through the pass after those turbulent centuries of stabilization, who climbed down to the mainly buried sphere of white light to touch it... and was never seen again. For it had opened like a Gate to take him into hell.\\n\\n Which was why the place had been named like that and why it was now forbidden, along with all of those desolate lands lying north of the mountains: the boulder plains, and further east a region of dizzily rearing stacks of volcanic stone, like vast spears of rock rising to rival the barrier range itself; and beyond the northernmost horizon, sending up a blue shimmer and sheen under the diamond stars and weirdly writhing auroras, the bitterly frozen Icelands.\\n\\n All of these places, forbidding and forbidden. But in any case, who would want to go there? Nothing lived there; nothing could live there, but bats in the caves, and wolves up in the peaks and passes over Starside, and certain lesser creatures. Surely it was no fit habitation for men. Not for any sort of men. Not yet, anyway ...\\n\\n Shaitan came across his first true men by the light of their campfire, and saw that they were clad in the furs and skins of animals. There were three of them and they saw him at the same time, saw also that he was naked; which was just as well for Shaitan, for they were hunters. If he had clothed himself and come upon them suddenly like that ... with his height, he could have been mistaken for a great bear. As it was he found himself covered by their crossbows as they scrambled to their feet and turned more fully towards him. But then:\\n\\n \u0027A man!\u0027 one of them grunted, frowning.\\n\\n And: \u0027An idiot!\u0027 said another. \u0027I very nearly put a bolt in him!\u0027\\n\\n Shaitan read their expressions, their lips, in part their minds. Their words fitted readily with everything else he saw, so that he understood much of their language from the start. As they came forward to peer at him in the firelight, the last of them queried nervously, \u0027A madman? Do you think so?\u0027\\n\\n And the second: \u0027What else? Up here in the night on his own, naked under the stars.\u0027 And to Shaitan, coldly, \u0027Who are you?\u0027\\n\\n Smiling his sardonic smile, he answered, \u0027I am what I am.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And your name?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shaitan!\u0027 Because finally he remembered it.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Shaitan,\u0027 the first of the three chuckled, but not unkindly, \u0027you\u0027ll excuse me for saying so, but it seems to me you\u0027re a bit daft!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You think I\u0027m ... demented?\u0027 He looked at them, and down at himself. \u0027But if I am mad - a harmless idiot -then why do you point your weapons?\u0027\\n\\n At that the second man again spoke up, saying: \u0027Because \"idiot\" and \"harmless\" don\u0027t necessarily coincide, that\u0027s why. Down on the levels, in the camp of Heinar Hagi, we\u0027ve one such \"idiot\" who works for his living -and Janni Nunov lugs boulders which I can\u0027t even budge!\u0027\\n\\n Moving artlessly so as to disarm them, Shaitan approached their fire, hunched down and fed a stick to the fitful flames. The three put up their weapons and approached him again, and he pretended not to study them where he warmed his hands. It seemed they had no leader with them but were equals. One was short, squat and bearded; the next of medium height, sturdy, heavy-jawed; the last young and wiry, whose mind seemed entirely innocent. But since they likewise studied him, Shaitan kept his scarlet eyes half-shuttered and gazed mainly into the fire. The red would be taken for reflected firelight.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n And finally the squat one, Dezmir Babeni, mused, \u0027You\u0027re soft and pale, whoever you are! For all that you\u0027re a big \u0027un and strong, you haven\u0027t known much of hard work. What\u0027s your tribe?\u0027\\n\\n Shaitan shook his head.\\n\\n The muscular, prognathous Klaus Luncani wanted to know: \u0027Why are you naked? Were you set upon? Ah, there are too many wild ones in the mountains these days, loners who\u0027d kill a man just for his good leather belt!\u0027\\n\\n Again Shaitan shook his head, and shrugged.\\n\\n But the young and wiry one, Vidra Gogosita, opened a pack and took out a long leather jacket, which he draped over Shaitan\u0027s shoulders by the fire. It was an old jacket but comfortable. And he said, The nights are cold. A man - even a fool - shouldn\u0027t go naked on the hillside!\u0027\\n\\n And Shaitan smiled and nodded, and thought: Of the three, he alone shall live - but only as my thrall For he is sensitive, wherefore his agonies in my service will be that much sharper! A \u0027fool\u0027 has willed it... so be it.\u0027 But out loud he said, \u0027I thank you. But of myself ... I wish I could tell you more. Alas, I can\u0027t remember.\u0027 It was mainly the truth.\\n\\n \u0027Set upon, aye,\u0027 Klaus Luncani grunted, as if it were now decided beyond all doubt. \u0027By outcasts in the mountains. Clubbed on the head, all memory flown. Stole his clothes, they did. A man who hunts alone risks much!\u0027\\n\\n Dezmir Babeni moved closer, went to touch Shaitan\u0027s head, perhaps discover a wound there. Shaitan put up a hand to ward him off. \u0027No! There is ... a pain.\u0027\\n\\n Dezmir nodded, and left it at that. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-4.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \\n The vampires have been vanquished!
