{"id":80281,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"But he wasn\u0027t, and Nathan and Misha weren\u0027t his thralls. They were just children playing a game. One which they\u0027d used to play, anyway. For from that time forward they would never play it again ... Nestor\u0027s dream was fading, slowly giving way to crushing darkness and the return of physical sensations, most of which were feelings of pain. Pain and anger, a monstrous claustrophobia, and a nameless stench. The dream gradually receding, yes, but in its wake the pain lingering on. And the anger ... Nathan drifted in a darkness shot with brief, brilliant bursts of violent illumination, scenes from the recent past: Misha smiling where she held his arm tightly against her body . .. Nestor attempting to rape her against the wall of the barn, his voice husky with lust and fury, his hands hurting her with their fierce fondling ... the ironwood bar from the door in Nathan\u0027s hand, feeling good and hard and solid there. Then he had hit Nestor, hard! Following which something a great deal bigger had hit him, and harder! And now this claustrophobic darkness as his memories tried to piece themselves together and become whole again. Nathan knew he wasn\u0027t dreaming; he was sure of that; his dreams were very special to him, and this wasn\u0027t one of them. No, it was the period between sleeping (or lying unconscious) and waking; the interval when the real world starts to impinge again, and the mind prepares the body for a more physical existence. It was him trying to remember exactly what had happened before the world caved in, so that he would know how to act or react when it all came together again. And occasionally in such moments, those gradually waking moments as the mind drifts up from the fathomless deeps of subconsciousness, it was also a time for communication. Sometimes Nathan would hear the dead talking in their graves, and wonder at the things they said, until they sensed him there and fell silent. It wasn\u0027t so much that they feared Nathan; rather they were uncertain of his nature, and so held themselves reserved and aloof. This was understandable enough, for in their terms it wasn\u0027t so long ago that there had been things in this world other than men, more evil than men, which had preyed upon the living and the dead alike; the former for the blood which is the life, and the latter for all the knowledge gone down into their graves with them. Things whose alien nature, whose condition, was neither life nor death but lay somewhere in between the two, in a seething, sunless no-man\u0027s-land called undeath! They had been the Wamphyri, who were known to spawn the occasional necromancer: one of the very few things that the dead fear. Which was why the Great Majority were wary of Nathan. He knew none of this, only that he sometimes overheard them talking in their graves, and that where he was concerned they were secretive. He was like an eavesdropper, who had no control over his vice. But in fact, and despite that he could hear them talking and might even have conversed with them (if they had let him), Nathan was no eavesdropper in the true sense of the word, and no necromancer. He did come close to the latter, however; very close - perhaps too close - though he wasn\u0027t aware of it yet. But the dead were, and they daren\u0027t take any chances with him. They\u0027d trusted his father upon a time, and at the end even he had turned out to be something of a two-edged sword. And so Nathan lay very still and listened neither maliciously nor negligently, but out of a natural curiosity, and in a little while began to hear the thoughts of the teeming dead in their graves: the merest whispers or the echoes of whispers at first - and then a great confusion of whispers - going out through the earth like sentient, invisibly connecting rootlets, and tying the Great Majority together in the otherwise eternal silence of their lonely places. It didn\u0027t feel at all strange to Nathan - he\u0027d listened to the dead like this, between dreams and waking, for as long as he could remember - but this time it was different. Their whispered conversations were hushed as never before, anxious, questioning, even ... horrified? \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" For on this occasion there were newcomers among them - too many newcomers, and others who came even now - bringing tales of an ancient terror risen anew. Nathan caught only the general drift of it. But it was as if, along with a background hiss and shiver of mental static, he also heard the rustling of a thousand pairs of mummied hands all being wrung together. And so in the moment before they sensed him, he became aware that their fear was no nebulous thing but in fact very tangible. This much he learned, and no more. For as soon as they knew he was there ... ... Their thoughts shrank back at once, were withdrawn, cut off, and there was only a shocked, reverberating silence in the otherwise empty mental ether. It was as sudden as that, giving Nathan no time to probe any deeper into the problem; but at least he thought he knew how they had sensed him so quickly: because they had been alert as never before, almost as if they were expecting some ... intrusion? The only thing that worried him about it, was how in the end he\u0027d sensed that they identified him with the source of their terror! And finally, before their withdrawal, there had been the name of that terror, which at the last was whispered from the tips of a thousand shrivelled tongues, or tongues long turned to dust: Wamphyri! But why should that be - how could it be - that these long defunct legions of the teeming dead feared the Wamphyri, who were themselves dead and gone forever? Nathan knew he would find no answer to that here, not yet, not now that the dead had fallen silent. And so he left them to return to their whispered conversations, and rose up from his dreams to seek the answer elsewhere ... ... Rose up from dreams, to nightmare! To a memory complete with every detail of what had gone before, except the answer to the question: what had happened here? But in his first few waking moments Nathan knew he had that, too, for the dead had already supplied it. It was a fact, all too hideously reinforced by the alien stench of warrior exhaust gases, the rubble in which he lay sprawled, the distant screams of the dead and the dying, and other sounds which could only translate as inhuman . .. laughter? Unless all of these elements were figments of his imagination, and Nathan himself a raving madman, it could only add up to one thing: the Wamphyri were back! And they were here even now, in Settlement! Which prompted other questions: how long had he been unconscious? Minutes, he suspected, a handful at most. And what of Misha, and his mother ... and Nestor? Nathan dragged himself upright, clambered shakily out of the debris of the barn - and back into it at once! For out there, maybe fifty yards towards the town centre, he\u0027d seen the incredible bulk of a warrior hurl itself against a barter house and reduce it to so much rubble. And overhead, a huge, kite-shaped flying thing had arched its wings as it came down like some weird leaf into the main street. Someone moaned in the litter of timber and straw at Nathan\u0027s feet: Misha! He tore at the rubbish, hurling it aside, and stared down at Nestor\u0027s face, all bruised and bloodied. He was stretched our flat, unconscious, three-quarters buried; but it was his moan Nathan had heard, not Misha\u0027s. And even as he looked at him, so Nestor moaned again. But there in the rubble beside him ... a slender white arm. And this time it must be Misha! Trying not to bury Nestor deeper yet, Nathan dug her out. He slapped her face, gathered her up in his arms, whispered her name urgently in her ear. She was wan, dusty, pale in the starlight falling through wispy smoke and gut-wrenching stench. He couldn\u0027t tell if she was breathing or not. In the near-distance, the Wamphyri warrior roared as it moved inwards towards the town centre. Nathan looked around. The stockade fence was buckled outwards behind what had been his mother\u0027s house. There was a gap there, where the great wooden uprights had been wrenched apart. And beyond the gap, the dark forest. The darkness had never seemed so welcoming. Nathan saw how it must be, what he must do: first carry Misha to safety, then search for his mother, who was probably buried in the ruins of the house, finally come back one last time for Nestor. He picked Misha up and staggered from the ruins towards the break in the stockade fence. But half-way there he heard a panting and a patter of feet and looked back. A great wolf-shape - obviously one of Settlement\u0027s trained animals - had come from the direction of the main street and seemed to be making straight for him, seeking human company. All very well, but Nathan would have problems enough saving the girl he loved and his family, without having to worry about... Nathan\u0027s eyes went wide, wider. The \u0027wolf seemed to be enveloped in a drifting cloud of mist, and one of its forepaws was bulky with something that made a dull glitter. More biped than quadruped - loping towards him at an aggressive, forward-leaning angle - it only went to all fours in order to sniff the earth and turn its great ears this way and that, listening. Worse: its eyes were scarlet and glowed like lamps in the dark, and to cover its hindquarters it wore belted leather trousers! \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" And now Nathan saw that it wasn\u0027t coming through the mist, but that the mist was issuing from it! He had heard all the campfire stories of the old Wamphyri - their powers, hybridisms, animalisms -and knew what he was facing. And of course knew that he was a dead man. Canker Canison came loping, reared up snarling, as tall and taller than Nathan ...! Nathan tried one last time to stand Misha on her own two feet and shake her awake, to no avail. He held up a hand, uselessly, to ward the dog-, fox-, wolf-thing off. Canker came to a halt and leaned forward. He sniffed at Nathan, then at the girl in his arms, and cocked his head on one side, questioningly. And: \u0027Yours?\u0027 he growled. Nathan held Misha back from the monster; Canker laughed, caught him by the scruff of the neck and hurled him brutally aside, against the stockade wall. Unsupported, Misha crumpled to her knees. Canker caught her up, sniffed at her again, and snatched her rags of clothing from her in a moment. And as Nathan slumped to a heap in the long grasses at the base of the damaged wall - even as his eyes glazed over and he passed out - he was aware of Canker\u0027s eyes on him and his writhing muzzle, and the spray of foam coughing from his jaws as he laughed again and said: \u0027No, not yours - mine!\u0027 What he did not see or hear, because he was already unconscious, was the scream of a terrified woman running through the streets: the way Canker let Misha fall to go chasing after her, and his grunted philosophy: \u0027Better a live one than one half-dead.\u0027 And his half-bark, half-shout - \u0027Wait my pretty, for Canker\u0027s coming!\u0027 - as he plunged after his doomed, demented victim ... The pain and the anger ... And not only inside, but outside, too. It was an hour later and Nestor\u0027s turn to come awake - slowly at first, then with a sickening rush! And like Nathan before him, he too woke up from a dream to a nightmare. Except where Nathan had remembered everything, Nestor remembered very little: a handful of scattered, uncertain fragments of what had gone before. Mainly he remembered the pain and the anger, both of which were still present, though whether they sprang from dream or reality or both, he was unable to say. Three-quarters buried in rubble, dust, straw, his body was one huge ache. His face was a mess and some of his teeth were loose; at the back of his head, above his right ear, an area of his skull felt soft, crushed. When he put up a tentative, trembling exploratory hand through the debris to touch it, agonizing lances of white light shot off into his brain. Something shifted and grated under his probing: the fractured bone of his skull, indenting a little from the pressure of his fingers. He asked himself the same question that his brother had asked: what had happened? But unlike Nathan, he had no answer. Not yet. He pushed at wooden boards pressing down on him, shoved them aside, choked as dust and stench fell on him from above. But framed in the gap he could see the stars up there, drifting smoke, and strange dark diamond shapes that soared in the sky. And he could hear a throbbing, sputtering rumble, fading into the distance. Yes, and other sounds: faint, far cries ... moaning ... sobbing ... someone shouting a name over and over again, desperately and yet without hope. Nestor kicked at the rubble, extricated his arms, dragged himself into a seated position and shoved the clutter from his legs. He looked around, at first without seeing or recognizing anything; there was nothing here that his glazed eyes and stunned mind were prepared to take in. No, there was something: the tall stockade fence, which for a moment focused his attention. But even that was different, gapped in places and leaning outwards a little. He stood up, staggered, stepped from the debris. Whatever had happened here, his clothing seemed to have been ripped half from him! Automatically, fumblingly -like a man flicking dust from his cuffs after a hard fall - he made adjustments to his trousers, his leather shirt. And slowly, reeling a little, he headed for the town centre, away from the rubble of his mother\u0027s house. His mother\u0027s house? Now where had that thought come from? And turning to look back at the freshly made chaos - at the black, jutting, splintered timbers and smoking mounds of debris, under a dark shroud of still settling dust - he slowly shook his head. No, for his mother\u0027s house had been a warm and welcoming place. Hadn\u0027t it? Along the way, voices continued to cry out from shattered buildings; people stumbled like ghosts here and there, calling for help, or for lost families; flames gouted up where hearth fires turned ruined homes to funeral pyres. There was nothing Nestor could do about any of this, for there were far too many people in need of help. And anyway he needed help himself. He began to remember names and fractured, jumbled fragments of conversation: Jason, Misha, Nathan, Lardis, Andrei... Nestor? \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Jason: \u0027What will you do?\u0027 Nestor, growling: \u0027It\u0027s Misha\u0027s choice. With or without her, I\u0027ll go. But be sure I\u0027ll be back one day.\u0027 Misha, afraid: \u0027Because ... because he needed someone! And I was the only one who cared. But Nestor ... why are you doing this?\u0027 Nestor, determinedly: \u0027When your father and brothers learn what\u0027s happened, then they\u0027ll kill me!\u0027 Misha, astonished: \u0027No, they may not, for you are the Lord Nestor!\u0027 Nestor: \u0027Of course! And I fear no man, for I am Wamphyri!\u0027 Nathan: (But here there was nothing, no words at all but a cataract of numbers foaming down the falls of Nestor\u0027s mind and forming endless, meaningless patterns there, one of which was a weird figure-of-eight symbol like a discarded apple rind or wood-shaving lying on its side. And rising over the rush and swirl of numbers, a distant, dismal howling of wolves. And superimposed over all these things a haunted, haunting face, all sad and lonely and ... accusing?) Lardis: This is where the powers of the hell-lands and those of the Wamphyri clashed and cancelled each other out.\u0027 Andrei: \u0027But they\u0027re gone now, reduced to dust and ghosts, and we should let them lie.\u0027 Nestor, in anger: \u0027What, ghosts? The Wamphyri? Never.\u0027 For I am the Lord Nestor!\u0027 The voices came and went in Nestor\u0027s head: voices out of the past, the present, the imagination. Voices from child-reality, adult-reality, and unreality alike, all seeking the stability of a central focus, revolving together in the grand free-for-all of his trauma. True memories merged into pseudo-memories as his past life faded away and devolved to a single, self-repeating phrase, I am Nestor of the Wamphyri! Until it seemed certain that the present, surreal and incoherent as a dream, could only be a dream, given substance by the subconscious will of its creator. And Nestor felt relieved to know that he was only dreaming. In the near-distance, amid smoky, flame-shot ruins close to Settlement\u0027s east wall, a last lone flyer flopped up hugely on to a pile of rubble and craned its swaying head towards the sky. Pausing to watch, Nestor was vaguely aware of a rider in the saddle where the creature\u0027s neck widened into its back. But in another moment the flyer had thrust itself forward and aloft on powerful coiled-spring launching members, and rising up from the ruins it banked in a wide circle over the town and rapidly gained height. Feeling its shadow on him as it passed overhead, Nestor gaped at its massive diamond shape flowing black against the stars, and wondered at its meaning. Then, slack-jawed, with his head tilted back at an angle and his half-vacant eyes still fixed on the alien shape in the sky, he continued his shambling walk through the reeking smoke and scattered rubble; until his path was obstructed and he felt something splash wet and warm against his torn trousers. Sprawled at his feet, he saw the shattered body of a man whose face had been flensed from the bone. A dark red fountain was spurting in bursts from his savaged throat; but even as Nestor considered the meaning of this, so the crimson fountain grew spasmodic, lost height and gurgled out of existence. And with it the man\u0027s life. But it had been only one life, and this was only one body among many. Looking around, Nestor could see plenty of others, almost all of them lying very still. And so he came to the old meeting place, that great open space which stood off-centre in Settlement, a little closer to the east wall than the west, and there discovered life in the midst of all this death. But not immediately. First: The East Gate was burning. Yellow and orange flames were leaping high over the stockade wall, where the gate seemed to have been set on fire deliberately. The wide path from the gate to the gathering place was strewn with bodies; Nestor dimly recalled, however, that there had been a crowd here. Well, while the corpses were a great many, still they would not have made a crowd. So some had escaped, anyway. But from what? Wamphyri! said a voice in the back of his mind. But another said: Impossible, for they are no more! And a third, his own, insisted: But I am the Lord Nestor! The smoke was clearing now and the vampire-spawned mist evaporating, sinking into the earth. People were starting to come out of hiding, stumbling among the dead, crying out and tearing their hair as they discovered dead friends, lovers, relatives. Central in the open space, where tables lay overturned and the ground was strewn with the spoiled makings of a feast, a young man, Nestor\u0027s senior by five or six years, stood over the body of his girl and tore his shirt open, beat his breast, screamed his agony. She had been stripped naked, torn, ravaged, brutalized. Stepping closer, Nestor stared at the man and believed he knew him ... from somewhere. And a frown creased his forehead as he wondered how it was he knew so much yet understood so little. Then he saw the rise and fall of the girl\u0027s bruised breasts and noticed a slight movement of her hand. And as her head lolled in Nestor\u0027s direction, he saw a strange wan smile upon her sleeping or unconscious face. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" He moved closer still, touched the sobbing man on the arm and said, \u0027She isn\u0027t dead.\" Wild-eyed, the other turned on him, grabbed him up with a furious strength, shook him like a rag doll. \u0027Of course she\u0027s not dead, you fool - you bloody fool! She\u0027s worse than dead!\u0027 He thrust Nestor away and fell to his knees beside the girl. Nestor stood there - still frowning, still mazed - and repeated the other\u0027s words: \u0027Worse than dead?\u0027 The man looked up, peered at him through red-rimmed eyes, and finally nodded. \u0027Ah, I know you now, Nestor Kiklu, covered in dirt. But you\u0027re one of the lucky ones, born at the end of it. You\u0027re too young to know; you don\u0027t remember how it was, and so can\u0027t see how it must be again. But I do remember, and only too well! I was only six years old when the Wamphyri raided on Sanctuary Rock. Afterwards, I saw my father drive a stake through my mother\u0027s heart, watched him cut off her head, and burn her on a fire. That\u0027s how it was then and ... and how it must be now.\u0027 He hung his head and fell sobbing on the girl, covering her nakedness. There were more men in the open space now, a handful, but these were different, older, harder men. They had grown hard in their young days, spent in the shadow of the Wamphyri, and were now filled with some grim purpose. Nestor seemed instinctively to know these things, and felt he should know the men, too, but their names wouldn\u0027t come. They were hurrying towards the east wall, where colleagues on the high wooden catwalk beckoned to them, urging them on. Nestor followed in their wake, but more slowly, and tried to understand what one of the men on the catwalk was shouting to them. In the still night air - with only the dazed, bewildered, trembling voices of other survivors, and the whoosh and crackle of the fires to compete with - his words carried over the open area loud and clear. And for all that they were hard words, still there was a catch and even a sob in his familiar voice: \u0027Too late now, you dullards!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Didn\u0027t I try to warn you? You know I did. What? And you took me for a madman! And now ... now I think I am a madman! But all those years of building, of being prepared, gone up in smoke, gone for nothing. And all this good Szgany blood, spilled and wasted, and unavenged ...\u0027 And at last Nestor remembered him: Lardis Lidesci, whom even the Wamphyri had respected, upon a time. And beside him on the catwalk, Andrei Romani; between them they\u0027d wound back the loading gear of a giant crossbow, and manhandled a great ironwood bolt with a barbed, silver-tipped harpoon into its groove on the massive tiller. Men\u0027s work for sure, but they were men. So were the others on the ground, whose names now sprang into Nestor\u0027s mind: They were Andrei Romani\u0027s brothers, Ion and Franci, and the small wiry one was the hunter of wild boars, called Kirk Lisescu. Together with Lardis, these men had been legendary fighters in the days when the Wamphyri came a-hunting on Sunside and the Szgany dwelled in terror; even now Kirk Lisescu carried a weapon from those times, a \u0027shotgun\u0027 out of another world. But Nestor knew that except in dreams all such things were over and done with long ago. Weren\u0027t they? While he puzzled at it, the men had moved on towards the east wall. But up on the catwalk Lardis was shouting again and pointing at the sky - over Nestor! And now, shutting out the stars, a shadow fell on him. He looked up, at the lone flyer where it side-slipped to and fro, deliberately stalling itself and losing height. For a moment it seemed poised there, like a hawk on the wing, before lowering its head, arching its membrane wings and sliding into a swooping dive. It was heading directly for the bereft young man where he sobbed over his ravaged love. And its rider was lying far forward in his saddle, reaching out along the creature\u0027s neck, directing its actions with voice and mind both. Suddenly something snapped into place in Nestor\u0027s befuddled mind. For if this was a dream it had gone badly wrong. And if it was his dream, then he should have at least a measure of control over it. He started lurchingly back towards the ragged figure crouching over the girl in the centre of the open area, and as he ran he shouted a warning: \u0027Look out! You there, look out!\u0027 The man looked up, saw Nestor running towards him, and beyond him the others bringing their weapons to bear, apparently on him! Then he glanced over his shoulder at the thing swooping out of the sky, gasped some inarticulate denial, and made a dive for the shallow gouge of an empty fire-pit. As he disappeared from view the flyer veered left and right indecisively, then stretched out its neck and came straight on - for Nestor! Coming to a skidding halt, suddenly Nestor sensed that this was more than a nightmare. It was real, and the reality gathering impetus, rushing closer with every thudding heartbeat. He glanced all about, saw open space on every side and nowhere to take cover. From behind him someone yelled, \u0027Get down!\u0027 And a crossbow bolt zipped overhead. Then ... \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" ....he flyer was almost upon him, and the underside of its neck where it widened into the flat corrugated belly was splitting open into a great mouth or pouch lined with cartilage barbs! Nestor turned, began to run, felt a rush of foul air as the flyer closed with the earth to float inches over its surface. And in another moment the fleshy scoop of its pouch had lifted him off his feet and folded him inside. As darkness closed in, he saw twin flashes of fire from the muzzle of Kirk Lisescu\u0027s shotgun; up on the stockade catwalk, Lardis Lidesci and Andrei Romani were frantically traversing the great crossbow inwards. Then ....artilage hooks caught in Nestor\u0027s clothing, and clammy darkness compressed him. Squirming and choking, denied freedom of movement and deprived of air and light, he breathed in vile gases which worked on him like an anaesthetic, blacking him out. The last things he felt were a massive shuddering thud, followed by a contraction of the creature\u0027s flesh around him and its violent aerial swerving. Then his limbs turned to lead as the flyer fought desperately for altitude ... PART FIVE: Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers Vampires.\u0027 - The Sundered Tribes - The Search I Lardis and Andrei were asleep when the searchers found Nathan and brought him in along with five more. By then sundown was one-third spent, and Nathan had lain unconscious in the grass at the foot of the west wall for more than nine hours. He was still unconscious when they dumped him unceremoniously on his back on a huge plank table salvaged from the wreckage at the site of the meeting place. This was where the survivors were being examined - all the survivors - to see if they really were survivors. Between times, a lot had happened and was still happening. After the attack - after Wratha and her henchmen had done their worst, taken the best, destroyed what they could of the rest and left - then Lardis had taken charge, issued hurried instructions, finally rushed at killing speed up to his cabin on the knoll, where he\u0027d hoped against hope to find his wife and son waiting and unharmed. But he had doubted it. For he knew that Lissa always kept lamps burning in the cabin\u0027s windows when he was away, to guide him home, and he hadn\u0027t seen Jason since he and the Kiklu boys had gone on ahead into the town. That soft glow, from Lissa\u0027s lamps, could be seen for miles around - as indeed Lardis had seen it through the treetops during his and Andrei\u0027s approach to Settlement, but as he no longer saw it - burning up there against the dark flank of the mountains. And as he had driven himself like a madman up the steep side of the knoll, so he\u0027d wondered who or what else had seen that glow, and why his son hadn\u0027t come back down when he heard the uproar and saw parts of the town burning. It could be, of course, that Lissa had seen a suspicious mist on the slopes and stifled the lamps, and that then she\u0027d restricted Jason to the house. It could be ... ... But it wasn\u0027t. For when finally Lardis had got there it was to find his place in ruins. Following which he\u0027d spent a back-breaking hour digging in the rubble, finding neither Lissa nor Jason. In a way it had been a relief: at least they were - or might still be - alive! But it was also the greatest tragedy of Lardis\u0027s life. For he didn\u0027t know where or in what circumstances they lived. Taken by the Wamphyri? To be used by them, slaughtered by them, perhaps even ... altered, by them? That hadn\u0027t borne thinking about. And so for a while he\u0027d thought nothing but sat there in dumb silence, amidst the ruins, already grieving or preparing to grieve their loss. So that by the time Andrei came to sit with him -saying nothing but simply being there in silent commiseration - Lardis\u0027s unspoken agony was already turning outwards, to everlasting hatred and cold fury. But even so, and for all that his loss was great, he had known he wasn\u0027t the only one. And when finally he\u0027d looked at Andrei, to inquire in that gravelly voice of his, \u0027Well?\u0027 ... then his friend and ally of so many years had known that the old Lardis was back. And nodding grimly he\u0027d told him: \u0027In the old days you were iron, my friend. Now it\u0027s time to be iron again. For we\u0027re ready, down there.\u0027 Then Lardis had come to his feet, straightened his back and shrugged off his weariness. And: \u0027Then let\u0027s be at it,\u0027 he\u0027d said, as simply as that. But half-way down, pausing briefly, he\u0027d begged Andrei\u0027s forgiveness for striking him; also for the fact that he\u0027d been deep in the woods - alone and lonely, bitter and raging, far beyond the South Gate - when the Wamphyri had struck so devastatingly at Settlement. To which the other had answered: \u0027You have it, and on both counts, but only if you will forgive me: that I ever doubted you ...\u0027 Since when, the pair had done or directed what must be done, between times catching up on a little sleep; the latter out of sheer exhaustion. Mercifully their weariness was as much mental as physical, so that they hadn\u0027t dreamed; otherwise their task might be impossible. Work such as this did not make for easy dreaming. And so they were asleep, in a hastily erected tent close to the meeting place, when Nathan Kiklu and five others were brought out of the darkness into the light from the lamps and the blazing central fire. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" It was nothing new to Lardis and Andrei, this process of screening, the investigation or inquisition of the injured in the wake of a Wamphyri raid; in the old days they had seen plenty of this. But the last raid had been eighteen years ago and they were no longer inured to it. Of course, the friends and families of those they examined were invariably present, their dark Szgany eyes soulful in the flickering firelight, mutely questioning the examiners in their turn. But if the horror wasn\u0027t now, at the direction of free men - men who were still their own men - then it would only come later, and from a different source entirely. And all of them knew it. Coming to the table, Lardis shivered under the blanket round his shoulders and tied a knot in its corners under his chin. The accidental fires had been put out hours ago, since when the night had grown chilly ... or maybe it was just him. At least the stink of monsters had cleared away now. He glanced up at the mountains blue-edged with starshine; no mist on the peaks now. In any case, the Wamphyri rarely struck twice in the same place, not in the space of a single sundown. And usually their raids followed fast on the setting sun, when they were most hungry. It seemed unreal: to remember all of these things now. And to know how very necessary it was that he remember them. The first figure on the table was that of a woman in the middle of her life, maybe thirty-six years old. Lardis shook himself awake, rubbed sleep from his eyes and stared hard at her face. He knew her: Alizia Gito. Her man was three years dead; he\u0027d broken his back in a fall while hunting in the mountains. Upon the index finger of Lardis\u0027s left hand, he wore a ring of gold set with a large, flat, reflective stone. Holding this over her open mouth, he watched for signs of breathing, the filming of the polished stone. Patiently he waited, and was rewarded when the stone\u0027s glitter faded to an opaque moistness. She breathed, but very slowly and faintly. As yet this proved nothing, except that she lived. Lardis had seen people dying before, and knew how their breathing was wont to fade away like this. Ah, but he also understood how well undeath could imitate life! Alizia\u0027s face was very badly \u0027bruised and her jaw looked broken, but she had no wounds that Lardis could see: no cuts, and her neck was unmarked. He called forward two older women. \u0027Strip her -\u0027 - And a haggard young man stepped forward, a growl rumbling in his throat as he grasped Lardis\u0027s arm. Lardis looked him in the eye, unflinchingly, and continued: \u0027- but let her keep her dignity, what\u0027s left to the poor woman. Put a blanket over her.\u0027 The young man was Nico, one of Alizia\u0027s sons, about seventeen years old. Lardis recognized him, and now asked after his younger brother. \u0027Vladi?\u0027 Nico released Lardis\u0027s arm, shook his head. His eyes were very bright with unspilled tears. Taken,\u0027 he reported, with a gulp. \u0027I was in hiding under a cart. Towards the end of it I looked out, saw one of them knock Vladi on the head, toss him into the saddle of a flyer and make off with him. I found my mother later. Is she .. .?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Lardis could only shrug and shake his head. \u0027I have to look under this blanket to find out. Listen, I\u0027ve looked at a lot of women tonight. It means nothing to me, but I know it means a lot to you. We can look together, if you like?\u0027 He put an arm across the other\u0027s slumped shoulders. And they looked. Alizia was naked now; she\u0027d been half-naked anyway. Lardis saw ... obvious signs, but he had to be sure. \u0027Nico, I want to touch her, turn her over,\u0027 he said. \u0027Can you help me?\u0027 Very carefully, they turned her face down. There were indentations in her thighs and buttocks, deep as claw marks, some of them bleeding. Lardis shuddered and let the blanket fall. His face was working as he stepped back a little, nodding to three men who waited at a discreet distance. One of them was Andrei Romani. \u0027No!\u0027 said Nico, his voice the merest gasp, a breath of air. Lardis caught him by the arm, held him back. The executioners - three merciful killers - came forward very quickly. Nico screamed high and shrill, but Lardis trapped his neck in a powerful armlock and turned his face away. The three lifted Alizia in her blanket and carried her to the very end of the table. And there they hammered a stake through her heart. The sound was meaty, soggy, and crunching where ribs splintered. \u0027But she\u0027s alive, she\u0027s alive!\u0027 Nico was gurgling. \u0027She\u0027s my mother! I came out of her!\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 Lardis told him through gritted teeth, holding him even tighter, \u0027but what\u0027s in her now must stay there. She\u0027s no longer the mother you knew but a foul, undead thing. But you\u0027re lucky, for soon she\u0027ll be clean and merely dead. So forgive us if you can, and be thankful.\u0027 \u0027You ... bastard!\u0027 Nico spat in his face. And on the table, his mother sighed and struggled into a seated position! A ring of blood oozed from the rim of the stake between her breasts, also from her mouth where she\u0027d bitten through her bottom lip. But her eyes were open now, and they saw Nico. She sighed again, bloodily, and held out her arms towards him. \u0027My son! Nico!\u0027 and as Lardis turned the youth\u0027s face away a second time, so Andrei took her head off with one clean sweep of a bright-gleaming sickle. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Nico had passed out in Lardis\u0027s arms. He was carried away by Kirk Lisescu, taken to people who would look after him. The parts of Alizia Gito were carried in their blanket to another fire on the other side of the open space, and there disposed of. Lardis hung his head and Andrei went to him. \u0027Steel yourself,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re only half-way through.\u0027 Lardis looked at him from a face made haggard by sorrow. These people were mine, and I\u0027m killing them.\u0027 The other shook his head. \u0027We\u0027re killing Them,\u0027 he said. \u0027Or should we let them live, run off into the forest and hide, and come back at the next sundown to kill us?\u0027 Lardis half-turned away, then nodded, and looked at the next one on the table. And saw that it was Nathan Kiklu. They had already stripped him and thrown a blanket over him. Lardis went to him, saying, \u0027Nathan! Ah, no ... this is the worst! I had hopes for him. There was something different in him, something better.\u0027 He threw back the blanket, searched Nathan\u0027s body. There were bruises galore, but no cuts. Neither had he been violated, and the lining of his mouth was clean. As Lardis examined him, he coughed and groaned, began to stir. Lardis was excited. \u0027Do you know -\u0027 he said, more to himself than to anyone else, \u0027do you know - I think he\u0027s clear!\u0027 In the next moment his excitement turned to despondency. \u0027But his brother, Nestor: we saw him taken by that flyer.\u0027 \u0027A goner,\u0027 Andrei nodded, \u0027like so many others.\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t know that for sure,\u0027 Lardis propped up Nathan\u0027s head and gave his face a sharp slap. \u0027We put our bolt in that beast good and deep!\u0027 Andrei nodded again, and said, \u0027Aye, and Kirk\u0027s shotgun blew its rider right out of the saddle!\u0027 He looked up and a little apart, to where a Wamphyri lieutenant was nailed with silver spikes to a heavy wooden cross. He hung there like a bloody rag, apparently dead and certainly unconscious - for the moment. \u0027But the flyer made off, so what hope for Nestor now? If the wounded creature dropped him, then he\u0027s dead from the fall; likewise if it crashed. But worst of all if it made it home.\u0027 Nathan coughed again and rolled his head a little in the crook of Lardis\u0027s arm. Lardis glanced at Andrei, said: \u0027Where, home? Aye, Karenstack, I know - but where before that? These bastards might be new here, but they weren\u0027t new to their hellish game. They were full-fledged! They had flyers, warriors; they wore gauntlets! So where did they come from?\u0027 Andrei looked again at the lieutenant on his cross. \u0027When this one comes to, maybe we\u0027ll find out. But let\u0027s face it, he hasn\u0027t much of a choice one way or the other. If he talks he\u0027s for the fire, and if he doesn\u0027t ....e\u0027s for the fire. Personally, I think we should burn him now. What if they come back for him?\u0027 Lardis shook his head. They won\u0027t. They have other business to occupy them now.\u0027 For a moment he thought of Lissa and Jason, then shut them out of his mind. If he wanted to carry on here, then he must shut them out. \u0027But,\u0027 he continued, \u0027if they suspect it wasn\u0027t just an accident and we actually brought this one down and killed him ... they\u0027ll certainly wonder about it. Strangers here, they\u0027re not yet sure of our capabilities. This was their first raid on us, and they had the advantage of total surprise. Even so, it\u0027s possible we killed a lieutenant, which means we might also be able to kill one of them. That in turn guarantees their eventual return -not just out of curiosity - probably at the next sundown. So catching this one is a point in our favour, especially if we can make him talk. He must talk, for I want to know who they are!....or later, if for nothing else.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-14.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) The vampires have been vanquished!
