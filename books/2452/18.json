{"id":80285,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u0027You!\u0027 he snarled, swinging his weapon towards Nestor and pulling the trigger. But Nestor was on his feet, his arm already fully extended forward, and the red-blotched knife in flight! Nestor was good with a knife, but on this occasion he was lucky, too. It took the man in the throat, in the \u0027V of bone directly under his Adam\u0027s-apple, punching a hole there which penetrated to the spine. Even crumpling to the earth he was as good as dead, and so didn\u0027t see his bolt take Nestor in the side, skewering his flesh like a needle through a blister. He didn\u0027t see it, but there were others higher up the hillside who did. Nestor heard them cry out, looked up from where shock had knocked him off his feet, and saw them through the wash of scarlet agony flooding over him. A group of four or five men, something less than two hundred yards away, descending the hillside towards him in a series of breakneck leaps and bounds - vampire hunters! Nestor got his fingers into the tear in his jacket and ripped it open. The bolt had entered his body under the ribcage on his right side, scraping a rib at the back where its barbed head had emerged. Its flight was sticking out at the front, and both holes were dripping thick, dark splashes of blood where a five-inch bridge of white, puffy flesh joined them like a bulging roll of fat. Nestor didn\u0027t think twice but gripped the head of the bolt with his right hand and the flight with his left, and bent the wooden shaft against his side until it snapped. He saw the skin of his side bulge as the broken shaft forced the white flesh outward, and almost passed out; but he knew that if he did, it would probably be the last thing he ever did. And in any case, breaking the bolt had been only half of it. Now he must draw it out. He did so without pause, and had to fight from gagging as the red blood spurted. Then, cinching his jacket tightly to his body, he somehow got to his feet and made off down the steep slope. But weak and desperate as he was, his heart was already pounding and his breath faltering. And those men back there - Szgany, and full of bloodlust - they\u0027d not give him a second\u0027s respite or his life a moment\u0027s thought once they had him. It would be the stake, the knife, the fire for Lord Nestor of the Wamphyri! He limped to the rim of a bluff and looked over, saw deep water rushing into the foam and spray of broad falls, and white water all the way down to the levels and the broken bridges of Twin Fords. But from behind as if to spur him on, rising above the hiss and surge of foaming waters, he could hear the angry shouts of his pursuers. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" And looking back just once, to glimpse raised weapons and furious faces, he shouted his defiance - and jumped! Nathan got into Twin Fords a little less than two hours later. He found the town a shambles - a pesthole of stumbling, slack-mouthed survivors; a bubbling cauldron of narrow-eyed, suspicious, would-be avengers; a chaos of terrified, demented people - with little or nothing of Settlement\u0027s order and discipline about it. Before that, however: There were guards on the approach roads to the town, who stopped him the moment he crossed the river through the shallows of the fording place, where all that remained of a once-sturdy bridge was a weir of timbers crushed down into the mud. He was recognized as one of Lardis Lidesci\u0027s party, which had passed through heading west for Settlement just yestereve, and allowed to go on into the devastation. And the chaos was at once apparent. At least two fires were still smouldering where granaries had been gutted; the dead - or their pieces, if they had been vampirized - were still being dragged through barely recognizable streets to be burned on funeral pyres; the wailing of women and weeping of children was nerve-rending. Inside a more or less intact perimeter of wooden buildings, the destruction was enormous, far worse than in Settlement. Here, where a great many houses had been simply smashed flat, it appeared that the Wamphyri and their creatures must have raged out of control. Approaching the centre, where the leaders and elders of the Szgany Zestos were holding a meeting, Nathan witnessed the discovery and destruction of a vampire thrall who had slept too late. Flushed from her hiding place under the eaves of a house by men brandishing torches, a woman was driven into the street and ringed about. With the sun beating down on her she shrank back and tried to cover herself, all the while raving and gibbering, and cursing the men about her in language so filthy that Nathan couldn\u0027t believe it. Wild, grey as a cloud, with eyes bubbling like sulphur, finally she braved their torches and launched herself at the nearest man. And as she snarled at him it was at once obvious that her eye-teeth were unnaturally long, white and sharp! The bolt which cut her down was equally sharp, likewise the knives with which they took her head ... Then Nathan arrived at the meeting place in the shade of a large, hastily erected, open-sided tent. And as the gathering broke up he recognized Karl Zestos, the oldest son of Twin Fords\u0027 former leader. His father, Bela Zestos, was dead now, a heroic victim of the vampire raid; if from the wreckage of his people Karl could salvage a number sufficient to lead, then he would become a Traveller King in his own right. Recognition like sorrow was mutual; the two spent a few moments trading their grim stories; Nathan picked up several details of last night\u0027s raid on Twin Fords which had not been available in Settlement. More than anything else, he was interested in Canker Canison. But when he explained why . .. then the other\u0027s face turned grey. And: \u0027My friend,\u0027 Karl told him, shaking his head, \u0027you must pray that your Misha is dead! The reports I have heard ...\u0027 \u0027I know,\u0027 Nathan answered, cutting him short. \u0027And when I think about it, I\u0027m tempted to try willing her dead! Except that\u0027s not possible, and I\u0027m glad it isn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027I understand,\u0027 the other nodded, then frowned at Nathan and added: \u0027But something is strange here. I remember you differently: not only from your colouring, which is rare among the Szgany, but also for the fact that you were quiet and retiring. You have a brother, right? He\u0027s the one I remember as forward and outspoken!\u0027 \u0027Am I forward and outspoken?\u0027 Nathan was surprised. Then perhaps I\u0027ve gained from Nestor\u0027s loss.\u0027 He explained his meaning and his mission: how his brother had been taken, and how he had \u0027dreamed\u0027 of the flyer crashing in the hills close by. That ... rings bells,\u0027 Karl told him then; but if anything his frown was more deeply etched than before. \u0027Some men were up in the hills this morning, looking for changelings who had escaped out of town. You\u0027ll understand that there are many people we can\u0027t account for. Anyway, they discovered a flyer and ... a man. A youth, at least.\u0027 Nathan grabbed his arm. \u0027A youth? Alive?\u0027 \u0027He was - living - when they found him, yes,\u0027 the other replied. \u0027But \"alive\"?\u0027 He shrugged. \u0027Undead, perhaps.\u0027 Nathan groaned. And: \u0027Explain,\u0027 he said. Karl told him the story as he\u0027d had it, finishing with: \u0027He leaped into the torrent and was swept away. They saw him go under in the white water, but they didn\u0027t see him surface.\u0027 \u0027And you say he ... he murdered two men?\u0027 The other could only nod. \u0027He was seen to do it, aye.\u0027 Nathan shook his head. Then it couldn\u0027t be Nestor!\u0027 Again Karl\u0027s shrug. \u0027Who else could it be? The description I was given fits. Also, you\u0027ve related how things were in Settlement. So how do you know Nestor wasn\u0027t vampir-ized before the flyer took him? You don\u0027t.\u0027 He sighed. \u0027I\u0027m not unsympathetic, Nathan, but it seems to me you should forget him now and go back home to those you have left.\u0027 Nathan was bitter. \u0027I have no one left!\u0027 Then follow me,\u0027 Karl urged. \u0027I need good, strong young men. I\u0027ll take my people out of here and return to my father\u0027s way of life before he built this place, and be a Traveller.\u0027 \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" But Nathan\u0027s mind was still on Nestor, and now he mused: There are two tributaries plunging out of the heights. Which one did he jump into?\u0027 The one that descends to West Ford,\u0027 Karl answered. \u0027But what will you do?\u0027 Til try to find his body,\u0027 Nathan told him. \u0027And then I\u0027ll know, for better or for worse.\u0027 The other nodded. \u0027Good luck. But Nathan, if you do find him ... be prepared.\u0027 Nathan didn\u0027t find Nestor, but at least he found word of him. He spoke to the guards at the ruined bridge. They\u0027d seen the body of a man go drifting down river. There had been blood in the water and the body was facedown, motionless. They would have dragged him out but had failed to notice him until he was over the slippery weir and drifting deeper. He could be one of two things: a murdered victim of last night\u0027s raid, or a vampire thrall caught by the sun in the foothills. Anyway, that had been more than two and a half hours ago. By now he\u0027d be tangled in roots somewhere down river, or sunk to the bottom in the mud and the weeds ... Nathan thanked them for the information, if not for their \u0027assurances\u0027, then forded the river and set out to follow its course downstream. Walking a path used by the town\u0027s fishermen, and scanning the overgrown banks as he went, he followed the rushing waters to where the river joined with its twin in a broad green swath, but saw never a sign of Nestor. At which point most men might have given up, but not Nathan. He would follow the greater river all day, if need be. And when night came? ... Well, sundown must find him wherever it found him. And for that matter, what difference did it make? Fifteen minutes after Nathan passed from sight of the West Ford bridge, Lardis\u0027s runner made the crossing. He had been held up by a string of vampire hunters along the way. By then the guards at the fording place had changed; one of them reported that he\u0027d seen a man of Settlement talking to Karl Zestos in the town; the runner hurried on into Twin Fords without ever knowing that Nathan was less than three miles away but in a different direction. Having found and spoken to Karl, the runner quickly returned to the sunken bridge. This time the guards could only shrug and offer their opinions that Nathan must be on his way back to Settlement, and that the two had passed each other by on different trails. It seemed the only logical explanation. Thus the runner gave up the chase, and began retracing his steps... PART SIX: Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers Szgany Sintana - Dissension in the Aerie The Thyre Where the river swung east in a languid curve through deepening forest, broadening out until details on the far bank were hard to discern, there Nathan was about ready to admit defeat. By then the morning was more than half-way through and he was exhausted; he had been on the move nonstop since before first light, a period of some thirty-two hours. Also, since the path had come to an end just four or five miles south-east of Twin Fords, the going had been very difficult. Now, in a sun-dappled clearing by the bank, he lay down in the long, sweet-smelling grass to sleep, and was just beginning to drowse when he was startled to hear a familiar clop, clop, clop, of cloven hooves, the creak and jolt of caravans, and the jingle of trappings and Szgany bells. Somewhere close to hand, hidden by the river\u0027s rearing fringe, there must be an old Traveller trail; for these were surely the sounds of a party of Gypsies, who were even now passing through. Nathan was wrong: they weren\u0027t just passing through but making camp, which he saw when he left the river, pushed his way through a tangle of soft-leaved shrubbery, and emerged on the old trail. And as he appeared in the open, on the ancient rutted track, so they likewise saw him. Brown, soulful female eyes met his deep blue ones across the trail\u0027s width, and Nathan froze on the instant as the girl melted back into the greenery and out of sight. He\u0027d suddenly remembered that these were strange times, and the last thing these people would be expecting was a wild man jumping out at them from the forest! On the other hand there were a good many of them, and Nathan was just one. Also, the sun was high, and so there was little chance of vampires abroad in the woods. Certainly they were aware that the old threat lived anew in Starside; that was obvious from the moment of their first greeting. Tear down the mountains,\u0027 said a soft Szgany voice from one side, startling Nathan. Jerking his head in that direction, he saw a tall, lean, incredibly weathered man of indeterminate years, propped casually with his shoulder against a tree. And just from looking at him Nathan could tell that these people were real Travellers, Szgany in the fullest sense. No permanent dwelling place for such as these; township comforts had never lured them from their ways, not for more than a night or so; they had been on the move all their days, as much a part of the wilderness as the creatures of the woods. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Which meant that they might not know of the return of the Wamphyri after all. For among the true Travellers the old ways were still remembered as yesterday, and the old greetings - which could as well be maledictions as pleasantries, depending on the times and situation -were still very much alive. \u0027Tear down the mountains,\u0027 this one had intoned, and Nathan knew the answer. He\u0027d heard it from time to time when Travellers passed through Settlement trading their good skins, sharpening knives and axes, and reading palms. He had heard it before, but never used it. Because then he\u0027d neither needed nor wanted to speak to anyone. Things were different now, however. And so: \u0027Aye, tear down the barrier range,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Let the sun blaze full upon the last aerie, and melt it down to the ground!\u0027 The man acknowledged Nathan\u0027s understanding of the old curse and nodded, but at the same time he frowned and said: \u0027And yet ... you\u0027re not a Traveller. Then perhaps your town has made us welcome in the past. For we don\u0027t hold it against you town people that you have chosen to settle. We visit now and then, and sometimes find it good to talk with others. We merely think it foolish to stay trapped in one place, like a fungus on a tree. For when the tree falls, the fungus goes with it...\" He brought out his right hand from where it had been hidden by the bole of the tree, and in full view applied the safety catch to his loaded crossbow. Then, nodding again, he added: \u0027Aye, foolish - especially now that the Wamphyri are back! But then, we\u0027ve always said that they would be. And can you tell me a better reason for having spent all these years on the trail?\u0027 Nathan shook his head, and answered, \u0027Right now, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here, too. But I\u0027m not running away from them, just searching for ... for my brother, who was their victim. I ... lost him last night, in Twin Fords. A man was seen to fall in the river. I thought that it might be him, and if I followed the river I might find him.\u0027 \u0027And did you?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 he shook his head. And stepping forward he offered his hand. They clasped forearms, and Nathan said, \u0027I\u0027m Nathan Kiklu, of the Szgany Lidesci.\u0027 The other smiled, however humourlessly. \u0027Szgany, you say? The Szgany Lidesci? From Settlement? Well, it\u0027s true at least that old Lardis used to be a Traveller! I\u0027m Nikha Sintana, and these are my people. We, too, stayed in Twin Fords last night, and I also lost a brother. At least, I lost one who would have become as a brother to me. So much for the safety of towns! As for running away...\u0027 Nathan saw his error at once and went to correct it. \u0027I meant no slight or insult!\u0027 \u0027None taken,\u0027 the other shook his head. \u0027We are running away! What? Should we sit in a burning tree, drink poisoned water, tie boulders to our necks and carry them into the river? And should we live in a town, lighting great communal fires to welcome the Wamphyri to their feast?\u0027 Again he shook his head. \u0027From now on I think a great many will be \"running away\", just like me and mine. But last night - what an error! Of all the nights to choose to spend in the company of settled men!\u0027 While Nikha Sintana talked, Nathan made him the subject of a thorough appraisal. He did so openly, with a display of natural, friendly curiosity; it was the Szgany way when meeting strangers. And what he observed was impressive. Nikha was - he could be - oh, anything between thirty-five and forty-five years old. The actual number of his years was a secret hidden in the agelessness of his penetrating, intelligent brown eyes, in skin weathered to a supple leather, in the oiled flexibility of sleek-muscled arms and the easy litheness of his posture. When Nikha leaned against a tree he didn\u0027t just slump; the tree seemed not only to support him but became one with him, lending him its strength. Indeed, there appeared to be a great deal of Nature\u0027s strength in every part of him. His hooked nose was almost as sharp in profile as a kite\u0027s beak, but without its cruelty. His brow - for all that it was broad to accommodate a good brain and wide inscrutable eyes - had the flat slope of a wolf\u0027s. His lips were thin, grooved as old bark, and maybe not much given to smiling; but at the same time Nathan could not fail to notice the laughter lines, too, at the corners of his eyes and mouth. Overall, with his dark-grey, shoulder-length hair, Nikha Sintana reminded him of nothing so much as a lean and rangy hunting owl. The Traveller had fallen silent now, waiting for Nathan\u0027s response. And Nathan was not remiss. Tm sorry you lost someone. I feel for you and know your pain well. For just like me, you also lost a brother.\u0027 Nikha nodded. \u0027But my sister\u0027s pain is the greater. She was to have married this one. Which is how he would have become my brother.\u0027 \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Nathan, quietly. He looked around. The Gypsies had led their animals into the forest\u0027s shade; a few tents of skins were being erected; a cooking fire was already smoking under a tripod of green branches, fuelling itself on dry bark tinder. Men were moving like shadows under the trees; a crossbow thrummed and a pigeon fell in the sun-dappled glade; a youth with a fishing line made for the river bank, collecting moth larvae bait as he went. There was something very natural, very appealing, about all of this almost casual activity. Nathan felt ... comfortable here, in the company of these people. Except comfort was a feeling he couldn\u0027t afford. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" He straightened his shoulders and said, \u0027I should get back to my search.1 Nikha took his arm. \u0027We\u0027ve stayed in Settlement from time to time. Lardis Lidesci was always a friend, in the old days and in the new. I\u0027m not a man to incur debts, but where they exist I always try to square them. You are tired, Nathan Kiklu. You look fit to drop. As well sleep here among friends as alone along the river, and when you\u0027ve rested eat with us. That way, in some future time, my debt will have transferred to you. It\u0027s from small debts such as these that friendships are forged.\u0027 Nathan felt his weariness dragging on his bones and remembered now that he\u0027d been about to sleep. Also, his back was a mass of blue bruises, whose aching was such that it might soon immobilize him entirely unless he rested first. \u0027I\u0027m tired, it\u0027s true,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I don\u0027t wish to inconvenience you.\u0027 \u0027No such thing,\u0027 the other replied. This is where we make camp, eat and sleep. You\u0027ve come across us at the right time. Our lives may be short but Sunside\u0027s days are long. At least while the sun is in the sky we may sleep safely. As for your search: the river is wide and its banks overgrown, with miles of forest on both sides. I understand your need, but I can\u0027t say I\u0027m envious of the task you\u0027ve set yourself. A rest can\u0027t hurt ... and then a little food, to fuel you on your way?\u0027 In this way Nathan found his mind made up for him. \u0027I\u0027m in your debt,\u0027 he said. Leading him into the camp past a small caravan, Nikha said: \u0027My wagon. I shared it with my young sister, and cared for her until she was a woman. Then, when Eleni found herself a man in Twin Fords, or when he found her, we made them a tent of skins. This time passing through Twin Fords she would have been married; this very day, in fact! But last night, in the middle of a small celebration ... well, you know what happened. All of that became as nothing. Now for a while she\u0027ll put up her tent and sit in it, and mourn this man she never got to know.\u0027 His voice hardened. \u0027But she\u0027ll forget about him soon enough, and the tent won\u0027t go to waste. Maybe it\u0027s just as well.\u0027 Nathan glanced at him, perhaps a little sharply. Nikha saw his frown and raised a defensive eyebrow. \u0027If she\u0027d known him well, then she would mourn him that much harder. And what if there had been children?\u0027 \u0027That seems a hard point of view,\u0027 Nathan was frank. \u0027Because I can remember hard times,\u0027 Nikha answered. \u0027And harder still to come, I fear.\u0027 He paused a while to fondle the ear of a beast of burden, a shad, one of a pair hitched to the thill of his vehicle. Shaggy as a hugely overgrown goat and of a like intelligence - but less boisterous, wider in the shoulder and sturdier in the legs - the creature and its companion waited uncomplainingly for someone to unhitch them and put them to graze. Turning its head, it offered up a grateful bleat and allowed Nikha to scratch behind its ear. And: \u0027Aye,\u0027 he finally continued, as if he talked to himself or to the shad, \u0027even the smallest comforts will be hard come by from now on, I fancy. For men and beasts alike ...\u0027 Meanwhile, Nathan had looked the camp over and noted its size and composition. There were two caravans and a flat, covered cart, half a dozen shads and two calves, and a few goats tethered at the back of the vehicles. Dangling outside the caravans, festooning their sides, were all the tools and utensils necessary to Traveller life, each item muffled now to prevent unwanted jangling and clattering. And under the trees at the rim of the clearing, three good-sized tents stood cool in the shade. Finally, the camp had its own wolves, a dog and a bitch. Capable hunters, they would see to themselves and provide early warning of intruders - which explained how Nikha Sintana had been so quick off the mark and waiting on Nathan\u0027s arrival. According to Lardis Lidesci\u0027s campn\u0027re stories, there had been hundreds of groups such as this one upon a time. Scarcely larger than a few family units - able to melt away like ghosts into the forests, or hide in small caves during Wamphyri raids - they had made harder targets than the larger, more prominent Traveller tribes. Several of Nikha Sintana\u0027s earlier statements had more than suggested his solitary nature, which the size of his party might appear to confirm; but to Nathan it seemed more likely that he simply adhered to this old tenet, that small is synonymous with secure. Of people, the group was made up of thirteen in all: four men, including Nikha, three women, and five children whose ages ranged from a small infant to the youth in his early teens who had gone fishing. The thirteenth ... was Eleni Sintana, that sister of whom Nikha had spoken. Nathan had caught only the briefest glimpse of Eleni in the moment he broke through the undergrowth on to the track, but in that same moment he had seen something in her eyes which had seemed to strike a resonant chord within himself ... perhaps it had been her eyes, so much like Misha\u0027s. In any case, he\u0027d been aware of her presence ever since but was careful not to look at her directly. Travellers are often fiercely protective where their women are concerned, and they don\u0027t care for forwardness in strangers. He was aware of her now to one side of the camp\u0027s central area, where she used an axe to break up dead, fallen branches into firewood. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" This is Eleni,\u0027 Nikha confirmed, leading him across the clearing, \u0027my sister. She cuts firewood to occupy her mind.\u0027 She looked up as they approached - looked at Nathan and smiled, however wanly - and he saw now that it was her eyes. They took him by surprise, for he\u0027d thought that only Misha\u0027s eyes could be so warm, black and caring. Obviously he\u0027d been wrong; or perhaps it was just that Misha had been so much on his mind lately, that... This is Nathan Kiklu,\u0027 Nikha said, breaking into his thoughts, and possibly into hers, too. \u0027A man of Settle- ment, from Lardis Lidesci\u0027s people. He could use a wash, a place to sleep, a blanket to keep him warm. Until our meal is prepared. Will you see to it, little sister?\u0027 She nodded and straightened up. And now that they\u0027d been introduced, Nathan allowed himself to look at her. Maybe twenty or twenty-one years old, she was typically Szgany. All lithe and sinuous, with movements as smooth as oil, her hair was shiny black, her skin tanned to a glow, her mouth generous and sensuous at one and the same time. And there was something wild as the woods about her - even more so than her brother - so that if Nathan didn\u0027t know better he might think there was room for only one mood in her: she should be vivacious and live life to the full, joyously, with a husky laugh that teased, taunted but never quite seduced. Because when finally Eleni did love, then her man would get all that she could give. Mainly nai\u0027ve, Nathan was wont to make judgements such as this at first sight. And sometimes he was right. Eleni shouJd be that way; perhaps she would have been and could be again, one day. But for now ... she was small and sad and lonely. As Nikha walked away, back towards his caravan and animals, Nathan began: \u0027Your brother has told me -\u0027 and paused. \u0027- I mean, I just want you to know that we\u0027re two of a kind. For just as you have lost your man, so I have lost my girl.\u0027 She nodded seriously, and answered: \u0027I know how much you have lost, for it\u0027s in your eyes. I knew from the first moment I saw you. Ah, but I saw much more than that in those strange blue eyes of yours, Nathan! They are filled with all sorts of things, and you\u0027re not much given to hiding them.\u0027 He was surprised, not quite sure of her meaning. Perhaps he looked at her too openly. He turned his eyes aside at once. \u0027Have I ... been forward? If I\u0027ve seemed so, then -\u0027 \u0027No, no, not that,\u0027 she cut him short. \u0027And if you were, what of it? Gypsies are forward. If a person is liked no one complains, and if he is not liked we say that he is forward. No, but you have been the sad one for a long, long time, and now is the worst time of all.\u0027 He shook his head, frowned, fingered his chin. \u0027But ... how can you know?\u0027 And now her smile was warmer. \u0027Oh, I read palms,\u0027 she said, tossing her ringlets back out of her eyes. \u0027Like my mother before me. Except, why it\u0027s easier far to read faces! And as I said, your face -especially those eyes of yours - tells a long, sad story.\u0027 She reached out and touched his brow. \u0027Such lines, and so very deep, in a face so young ...\u0027 She shook her head, wonderingly. But before he could question her further: \u0027Enough of that for now,\u0027 she said. \u0027Come over here, to my tent. Nikha says you need a wash. We can take care of that. And then I\u0027ll get you a blanket.\u0027 Close to her tent she set up a tripod and bowl, and brought hot water from the fire. A piece of bark provided a cleansing, milky sap, with which Nathan scoured his face and hands. But watching him, Eleni .saw him wincing whenever he stretched his arms. He had removed his leather jacket but still wore his shirt. Take it off,\u0027 she said. He looked at her sideways, questioningly. They were alone in the clearing now, almost. The men were off hunting; women tended their offspring or performed other duties; Nikha was seeing to his beasts. Take what off?\u0027 \u0027Your shirt. When you bent over it rode up your back. I have seen your bruises. Were you beaten?\u0027 Beaten? No, merely tossed aside - but by a Thing as strong as four men! The thing that took my Misha. \u0027A Lord of the Wamphyri very nearly killed me,\u0027 he finally answered. \u0027I suppose I was lucky.\u0027 He tried to reach over his shoulder and grasp the fabric of his shirt, but couldn\u0027t. Perhaps it was as well; Nikha had come back and was sitting on the steps of his vehicle. Seeing Nathan glancing that way, Eleni asked him: \u0027Are you concerned that my brother is watching us? Well, you shouldn\u0027t be.\u0027 And before he could answer she took the hem of his shirt in both hands and lifted it, and as he bent forward stripped it from his back. \u0027Now your brother will know I\u0027m forward,\u0027 he groaned. \u0027Or that you are!\u0027 And now for the first time she laughed, and her laugh was as husky as he had guessed it must be. \u0027Nathan, Nikha will be delighted!\u0027 she told him. \u0027Can\u0027t you see that he\u0027s still trying to marry me off?\u0027 But as she saw the extent of his bruising her laughter died away. And: \u0027You suppose you were lucky?\u0027 she repeated him. \u0027But your back should have been broken in three places! Now wait.\u0027 \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" She ran to Nikha and past him into the caravan, and was back in a moment with ointment wrapped in a leather pouch. \u0027It smells, but it\u0027s good!\u0027 she said, applying the stuff liberally to his back. \u0027Next sunup the sting will have gone, and by midday the bruises fading. I guarantee it. When we pass through the townships, we Gypsies guarantee all of our products!\u0027 And again she laughed. Then she helped him on with his shirt, took him into her tent and gave him a blanket. Her bed was a huge watertight skin stuffed with down, herbs and dried ferns; more than sufficient for Nathan\u0027s needs, he made no complaint. As he lay down she threw the blanket over him, and almost before she left the tent and closed its flap he was asleep ... Numbers formed a whirlpool which sucked Nathan in, whirled him round and around, and dragged him unpro-testing down the central funnel of warping algebraic equations. To anyone else it would be a nightmare, but not to him. Unlike the dead, who could have talked to Nathan if they wished it but never did, the numbers were his friends. In a way, they did \u0027talk\u0027 to him; except he didn\u0027t have the math to understand their language. In a world largely without science, Nathan had no math at all. What would probably have been instinctive, intuitive in him from his first serious lesson, had never had the chance to develop. Not yet. But he did understand that the numbers could sometimes carry him - his thoughts at least - to other places, other minds. It was a telepathic talent he shared with Nestor, part of which was to reach out with his mind and make a connection with that of his twin. Another part of it, which was his alone, allowed him to contact and speak with his wolves. In his waking hours this might only be accomplished by an effort of conscious will, and even then it had sometimes failed him, but when he slept it was quite beyond his control. For then his talent seemed to work on its own, or occasionally with the help of what Nathan had long since named \u0027the numbers vortex\u0027. Now he was in that vortex, but only for a moment. For in the next he felt himself expelled, hurled out and down - into water! Into the river! And because he had searched for Nestor, now he was Nestor. He was one with his brother\u0027s mind. He knew what Nestor knew, felt what he felt, observed what he observed. Which was nothing. Nathan knew what \u0027dead\u0027 minds feel like. This was it, and yet at the same time it was less than death. For the dead know many things, and this mind - Nestor\u0027s mind - knew nothing at all! And Nathan believed he knew what that meant: that his brother was freshly dead, and as yet had learned nothing from all of those others who had gone before. He felt what Nestor felt: nothing. Or perhaps he did feel or was aware of something: the gentle flow of cold, cold water - his lungs full of the stuff, which weighed like lead to drag him down - and the first, tentative nibble of some small, curious fish. He observed what his brother observed: nothing. Or if not that, a drift of dark green weed sliding slowly across his blurred, submerged view, to fill the screen of his gaping, glazing eyeballs ....efore the final darkness closed in! And with that he knew that Nestor was dead, drowned, and gone from him forever. He started awake -.\u0027 - To find Eleni Sintana down on her knees beside him, her brown eyes wide and anxious where they stared into his. She had hold of his shoulders, holding him down under the water. Except ... there was no water. And at last he breathed, stopped struggling, allowed her to push him back into his own depression in her bed. And: \u0027A dream?\u0027 she inquired, her concern clearly apparent. Nathan nodded, felt cold sweat drip from the tip of his nose. More than that, Eleni, he wanted to say, but couldn\u0027t, because he knew that she wouldn\u0027t understand. But looking up into her face, her eyes ... she so reminded him of his mother ... and of Misha ... he wished she would wrap her arms around him, for his protection. He saw that she was going to - until Nikha\u0027s soft voice sounded from the door of the tent, saying: \u0027We\u0027re about ready to eat, Nathan. Will you join us?\u0027 And the spell was broken. Nathan joined the others to eat, but he was quiet and had no appetite. There was nothing wrong with the good food, nothing wrong with the company, just with him. For he knew now that he was alone, entirely alone, and that what he\u0027d mistaken for his awakening into this world had only been the beginning of the end. The Wamphyri had wrought reality out of a fantasy -changed everything, made him aware of his place here, and given him an identity - only to rob him of his roots. Now he was drifting, as Nestor\u0027s body had drifted, and not even the weeds of what might have been to anchor him. For the last link had been broken, Nestor was dead, and Nathan felt in his heart the coldness of his brother\u0027s watery grave ... And two miles down river, in a shingly bight, a burly, bearded fisherman cried out, tossed aside his rod, went plunging into the water to his thighs. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" He had been monitoring the progress of a log drifting out of the main current and into the shallows of the backwater. And knowing that fish sometimes swim in the shadow of floating debris, he had thought to see a big one accompanying this piece of driftwood. But lolling closer to the bank, suddenly the log had given a lurch and turned over, and in the next second the fisherman had seen that what had come adrift from it to slip down into the clear water was anything but a fish! That had been a moment ago; now Brad Berea waded to the log and thrust it aside, sank to his knees in the shingle, and gathered up the body of a young man from where it bumped slowly along the bottom. The youth\u0027s clothes were ragged, waterlogged; he was limp, cold ... dead? Well, very likely. But his flesh seemed firm, his limbs were still flexible, and his lips were not entirely blue. In fact Nestor Kiklu was dead or as close as could be, and had been for several long seconds, but as yet his spirit had not flown the flesh. What his brother Nathan had experienced was not true death but the final sleep which leads up to it, except this time that sleep had been interrupted. Brad Berea carried Nestor to the bank, dragged him out feet first to let the water rush out of him, and thumped his chest until he coughed up mud, small weeds and more water. Coughed them up, lay still ... and breathed! He breathed - however raggedly, shallowly - and slowly but surely a semblance of life crept back into him. Into his body, at least... After their meal, Nikha Sintana and his people took their rest. Later, they would spread out into the forest and hunt more diligently; for they must find game now, in the daylight hours, to see them and their families through the long night ahead. After the hunting - assuming it was successful - they\u0027d be more at their ease; they would play, make music, talk over their short-term plans. The plans of travelling folk were ever short-term, Wamphyri or no; but by midday they would be back on the trail again. Nikha\u0027s idea, which he had told to Nathan while they ate, was this: He and his party would follow the old trail south to the narrow strip of prairie where it bordered on the furnace deserts. He knew the location of a spring there, which in all his years of wandering had never dried out. There was no shortage of game, and the fruits of the forest were always plentiful. In the woods at the edge of the prairie, well away from the customary haunts and routes of other Travellers, there Nikha\u0027s group would disguise their caravans in the thickets, stain them green to match the foliage, and pitch their tents under cover of the great trees. In short, they would quit travelling for a while at least, if only long enough to see how the wind blew. And if it seemed they had chosen a good, safe spot, then perhaps they\u0027d make it permanent. Settling there would go against the grain with Nikha, of course; it would be a solitary, ingrown existence with no company to mention and no external contacts. But at least they would exist, and more or less on their own terms. As for the Wamphyri: there would be richer pickings for them elsewhere. Word of their return would be spreading even now, but many townships would not hear of it until it was too late. In Twin Fords and other towns, there were plenty of old people who could not or would not move; these must soon fall prey to the vampires. And there would be a great many parties of refugees on the move outwards from threatened towns along the southern flank of the barrier range, whose leaders had forgotten or never known the skills necessary for survival in the wild. For a certainty, the Wamphyri would pick these off first. In Settlement and possibly a handful of other places, men would stand their ground, fight and inevitably die. The vampires loved to fight, and such bastions of defiance would present irresistible challenges. All of which should provide Nikha and his party a breathing space, ample time to settle into their secret place, discover hiding holes and prepare themselves against every hideous eventuality. One of the first things they would do would be to breed more watchdog wolves, and train them to be alert for strange sights, sounds, smells . .. With luck the vampires would never find their camp - or if they did would discover it deserted, its people fled into the woods or grasslands. And as any fool must see for himself, the closer you live to the sunrise, the safer you are from vampire slavery, death and undeath. Why should the Wamphyri bother to fly across all these miles of woodlands, when they could reap their tithe of blood so much closer to home? For to raid in the southern extremes of Sunside would mean a greater distance to travel back to Starside, before sunup. It was a small point but it seemed to make sense. As to why Nikha told Nathan all of these things: simply, he hoped to tempt him along. And so Nathan saw that Eleni had been right: Nikha was angling to catch her a husband before he and his people disappeared into solitude. Well, and Nathan supposed he could do much worse. But before that - \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" - His thoughts were all for Misha, despite that she was lost or dead ... or worse than dead. Misha and Nestor, yes. If only Nathan could see Nestor again, find him and take him from the river, and give him a decent grave. For while the teeming dead couldn\u0027t bring themselves to speak to Nathan, he was sure they would allow him a little time, a few words, with his own brother at least. The chance to make things right with him? Which was why, when they had finished eating and talking, he mumbled awkward excuses and headed for the river. Eleni said nothing but went to her tent; but Nikha Sintana, on his way to his bed in the caravan, came after Nathan at once and took his arm. \u0027Won\u0027t you come with us, then?\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 Nathan answered. \u0027Maybe I would, for Eleni\u0027s sake, if she\u0027d have me - and if you think I\u0027d make her a capable husband, of course. But first I must try one last time to find Nestor\u0027s body. Find and bury him, so that I\u0027ll know where he is always. For I think ... that he must be quite close to this place. I have a feeling, that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027I understand,\u0027 Nikha nodded, and gave Nathan a skin with a route marked on it, to bring him to their camp. \u0027We\u0027ll sleep now, then hunt, finally move on,\u0027 he said. \u0027By midday we shall be gone from here, and by sundown we\u0027ll be in our place, which I\u0027ve kept in mind these many years. How long will you search?\u0027 Nathan offered a despairing shrug. \u0027Until I can no longer hope to find him. Perhaps there\u0027s no hope even now, but I must try. And Nikha, even then I can\u0027t swear I\u0027ll be back. There are things in my head ... I have memories as fresh as yesterday ....t\u0027s not easy to swing this way and that, like a reed in the wind. It only looks easy.\u0027 Nikha nodded. \u0027Very well. But if you should decide that ... well, however you decide, only be sure to reach us before sundown, for after that there\u0027ll be no fire to guide you, and it might prove dangerous to come too close unannounced.\u0027 Then they clasped forearms, and through the trees Nathan could feel Eleni\u0027s eyes upon him until he passed from sight into the undergrowth ... He searched the river bank until the middle of the afternoon, when the ground on his side of the river turned into a bog and became impassable, and the overhanging branches were so full of creepers and rank, secondary foliage that the water was shaded, dappled, opaque. If his brother was down there, there could be no finding him now. As for burying him: Nestor would be buried already, in the weeds which had been part of Nathan\u0027s \u0027dream\u0027. Now, too, Nathan must decide what to do. Earlier, he had seemed to feel something for Eleni Sintana. Or perhaps he had simply felt it for himself: a yawning void, an aching need. In any case, he had a choice: join the Szgany Sintana in whatever future would be theirs, or return to Settlement and be Lardis Lidesci\u0027s son, replacing the one he\u0027d lost. Whichever he chose to be -husband to Eleni, or a son to Lardis - he would be a replacement, not the real thing; and he would always know that he was the second choice. Settlement seemed a long way off from Nathan, and he knew it could never feel the same if he went back there. If a girl passed by he would look at her, hoping it was Misha. When the women stamped their feet and snapped their fingers thus and so in the dance, he would think of his mother. And if some brash youth came striding, laughing along the road, it would always be Nestor from this time forward. No, the town would be full of ghosts now; indeed, Settlement itself would be a ghost. But Eleni Sintana was warm and alive ... And what of his vow against the Wamphyri? All very well, when there was a chance that Nestor lived. Together, united under a banner of vengeance, the two of them could have fought alongside Lardis Lidesci and taken whatever revenge was available to them, before they too paid the price. They could have, but no longer. For Nestor was drowned and cold. And again the thought came to Nathan: Eleni is warm and alive. It was a little more than half-way through the after- noon; there were still some twenty-five hours of full daylight left, and five or six more of twilight; Nathan was feeling worn out, as low as he had ever felt, and quite at the end of his tether. Over a period of time which would equal almost four days in the time-frame of the world beyond the Starside Gate - of which as yet Nathan knew nothing other than that it was there - he\u0027d managed to snatch only a few hours sleep. Now he must sleep, and sleep his fill, before heading south for ... for the encampment of the Szgany Sintana, where the forest met the savannah. Back up the river he had passed a tiny sandy island with a few reeds, shrubs and trees. Now he made his weary way back there, waded out to the island, curled up under a bush half in the shade, and almost at once fell into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. His last conscious thought as the darkness came down was that he would sleep for a good seven or eight hours, and still have plenty of time to trek to Nikha\u0027s camp before sundown. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" But the fact was that both physically and mentally Nathan was far more depleted than he thought. And while he slept ... on Starside the vampire plague-bearers were wide awake, active, and filled to overflowing with their loathsome poisons, their unspeakable ambitions ... Though as yet the rays of a slowly setting sun continued to paint the higher peaks of the barrier range a dazzling gold, its cleansing glare had lifted from the face of that one remaining aerie, whose name upon a time was Karenstack. And in the hour of the sun\u0027s passing, Wratha the Risen had called a meeting in her vertiginous apartments; several of her familiar bats had been dispatched into the stack\u0027s lower levels, where Wratha\u0027s renegades understood their messages far better than men under- stand the whining of dogs. And now the changeling vampire Lords attended her, however sullenly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-18.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) The vampires have been vanquished!
