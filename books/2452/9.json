{"id":80276,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"II\\n\\n Some hours after his meeting with Wratha, Karz Biteri, Historian to the Wamphyri, thrall to Maglore of Rune-manse, reported to his master in one of his several workshops and recounted the occurrences of the day. But not in every detail.\\n\\n When Karz was done, Maglore looked up from his examination of stretched, rune-inscribed skins (the bleached skins of trogs, mainly) and various fragments of carved bone, and said, \u0027Continue.\u0027 Simply that. A man of words, he nevertheless knew how to use them sparingly. And the implication of this single word was that he already knew there was more to be known.\\n\\n Maglore was one hundred and sixty years old. By Wamphyri standards he should be in his prime, but he looked old. He and certain others of the Lords and Ladies - mainly the so-called \u0027high-caste\u0027 of the Wamphyri - were modern disciples of Turgo Zolte: so far as possible, they followed Zolte\u0027s olden ascetic die-turns. These were simple and all based upon one ideal: To fight vampirism throughout life and undeath, even including the ultimate condition of vampiric contagion, which is to be Wamphyri! To deny oneself - and therefore one\u0027s parasite - those things which are the fuel of all evil works: blood, the carnal lusts of the flesh, suspicion and hatred of one\u0027s fellows, and the pride which comes before a fall. In short, to be Shaitan\u0027s opposite, or as much opposed to him and his ways as possible. It had been a losing battle for Turgo Zolte and all his followers ever since, but still they tried. And it accounted for Maglore\u0027s shrivelled aspect; for as he\u0027d learned well enough, though still he would deny it, the blood is the life.\\n\\n Yes, Maglore looked old, but Karz knew that he didn\u0027t need to. On those infrequent occasions when he called for his woman, then he would appear young again, and the Historian would know that he had taken the blood of a man.\\n\\n \u0027Continue, master?\u0027 Karz looked blank, and for all that he should know better wondered what Maglore was thinking.\\n\\n \u0027My thoughts are mine alone!\u0027 the Mage told him at once, in a voice that rustled. \u0027Unlike yours, which are to me like scenes in a shewstone, except when I\u0027m not given to exertion and would prefer to hear them from your mouth - such as now! Or perhaps you\u0027d have me look more deeply inside your head? That can be arranged, though it might cause you some small pain. Yet I admit to temptation; for who knows how many other secret things I\u0027d find in there, kept back from me, eh? Now, stop playing the fool and tell me about Wratha: what else did she say and do?\u0027\\n\\n Karz had not wanted to annoy Maglore, for which reason he\u0027d held in reserve various parts of his conversation with Wratha the Risen: for instance, that part in respect - or lack of it - to the self-styled aristocrats of Turgosheim, such Lords as Maglore and his peers, who were thought of as elders, sedate and sedentary in their ways. But now, at the Mage\u0027s prompting, Wratha\u0027s words were recalled and floated back to the surface of his mind:\\n\\n \u0027. .. Obey me now, Historian ... make no more speeches of warriors mewling in their vats ... these are the fears of old, old men, whose learning has stunted their manly appetites ...\u0027\\n\\n Maglore read her words there in Karz\u0027s mind, and smiled however bitterly. \u0027Huh.1\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Because we deny ourselves - because we are, well, yes, it may be said, kind rather than cruel, inquiring rather than inquisitorial, and retiring rather than rampant - she thinks us dodderers! Nothing new in that. But is that all? Threats to you and insults to me? If so, then you prize my sensitivity much too highly, Karz, for Wratha has been known to say far worse things than these! So tell me now, what else did this so-called \"Lady\" say and do?\u0027\\n\\n Karz looked at his master and was at one and the same time fascinated and repulsed by him, who once was a man. His deeply scored skin like stained, ancient leather grooved by time and use; his white eyebrows tapering upwards into temples whose coarse, receding hairline lay as strands of grey lichen on his sloping dome of a head; the crimson orbs which were his eyes, deep-sunken in their purple sockets: eyes which were narrowing now moment by moment, as Maglore\u0027s patience grew thin.\\n\\n Karz snapped out of it. \u0027Why, she walked among the tithelings, Lord!\u0027 he burst out. And then, more stumblingly (for he knew how unseemly it was to criticize the Wamphyri), \u0027Which is not ... not according to ... which goes against... which -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027- Which was simply wrong!\u0027 Maglore finished it for him; and reminded him: \u0027We are alone here, Historian! If you offend here, to whom shall I report you? I am your master, who makes punishment - if and when it is required.\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Lord.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Say on, then.\u0027\\n\\n Karz nodded, moistened his dry lips, and continued: \u0027One of the young male tithelings was tall, very strong, proud and even forward. He invited with his posture and hot eyes; he did not flinch when Wratha smiled at him and tried the muscles of his arms, nor lowered his eyes when she stood close - very close - to him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027More fool him!\u0027 Maglore growled. \u0027What then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027As I took the tithelings away for assignation, she told me: \"Tell the assignor that I have ... noticed this one.\" Which I did.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A strange thing,\u0027 Karz answered (but here he hung his head a little, as if ashamed of his own Szgany blood). \u0027The assignor was Giorge Nanosi, called Fatesayer, thrall to all and to none. He is no one\u0027s favourite and calls no Lord master, but merely performs his duties ... impartially.\u0027\\n\\n Maglore nodded, and what was human in him thought: This Karz Biteri is a wasted man. But if he were my thrall proper, then the waste would be so much greater. Among his own sort, doubtless he would be a great thinker, even a wise man. Which is why I have made no change in him but left him a man entire, or almost: for the originality of his thoughts, which are not merely images of my own. I allow him the freedom of thought, for he has a mind and is a thinker! And because he considers me a \u0027fair\u0027 or \u0027reasonable\u0027 master, he is faithful in his way and accepts my concerns for his own. Ah, but it\u0027s hard enough to be a common man, Szgany, in Turgosheim, without being a thinker too! Hence this brush with Wratha the Risen, when the words she overheard were mainly mine but from his mouth ...\\n\\n But that which was inhuman in him thought: On the other hand, and as he gets older, this honesty and outspoken spontaneity could become a problem. And so, in a year or two - when he has translated all of the remaining histories - it might be in my interest to favour him and replace those brittling bones of his with far more flexible stuff. For with his agile brain, why ... Karz Biteri would make me a crafty flyer!\\n\\n All this in a moment\u0027s thought, while out loud he said: \u0027Giorge Nanosi, called Fatesayer for obvious reasons? I know him, aye. So - what struck you as strange?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027First,\u0027 Karz continued, \u0027Giorge examined the tithe-lings and separated out those which he considered inferior. These were taken away for processing. The ... the requirements of Turgosheim; the provisioning; the needs of the manses and spires.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 Maglore waved a hand, dismissing a concept which to Karz was sheerest horror.\\n\\n Then,\u0027 the Historian went on, \u0027the Fatesayer lined up the rest and began drawing out the sigils from his leather bag, to which I was witness, as is the custom. First in line stood that young man whom Wratha had ... noticed. Giorge had put him there. And lo, the first bone shard he drew from the bag bore Wratha\u0027s sigil: a kneeling man with bowed head!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 Maglore growled again. \u0027I know her blazon well enough.\u0027 And then, if not explosively with a deal more animation: \u0027Corruption, Karz! What? Why, it might have been named after her! Not Wratha the Risen but Wratha the Sunken - into the quag of her own corruption! And you know it, and the Lady knows you know. Wherefore, in future, avoid her at all cost. For I value you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I avoid all of them, Lord,\u0027 said Karz, before he could still his tongue.\\n\\n But Maglore only nodded, and said: \u0027Corruption, aye. But should I be surprised? No, for all of us - the Wamphyri entire - are corrupt! We are not our own masters but governed by our creatures, even as we govern our thralls. Except where we are merely corrupt, Wratha is corrupt!\u0027\\n\\n Karz said nothing but merely waited, and Maglore finally went on, \u0027Did I ever tell you her story?\u0027\\n\\n Karz nodded. \u0027Yes, Master. To the point where she killed Radu Cragsthrall.\u0027\\n\\n Then let me finish it,\u0027 the other sank back in his chair and steepled his hands. \u0027For it\u0027s as well that men know this witch and her ways, as long as they steer clear from knowing her too well...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wratha lived with Karl a year in Cragspire. But she was not Mistress of Cragspire, only of Karl ... which we may suppose she found irksome. It may also be supposed that eventually she would get his egg, but eventually can be a long time.\\n\\n \u0027Now, Cragspire was one of the tallest spires; at sunup the rays of the sun, striking between the high mountain peaks, turned all its upper ramparts to fatal gold. For which reason Karl shielded the windows of his chambers with heavy curtains of good black bat fur. His several small warriors within the aerie, and the sun without, were all the protection he needed in those hours when the Wamphyri prefer their beds.\\n\\n \u0027Came that season when the sun is hottest and the coarser produce of Sunside - nuts, fruits, grains and wines - never more plentiful, when Wratha made her move. She exhausted Karl with her sex upon his bed (no small feat in itself!), and made him drunk with good wines. Then, when he was sound asleep, she bound him to the bed with chains. It has even been said that she sprayed the forbidden kneblasch oil about the room, more deadly to him than to her, for she was but a vampire while he was Wamphyri! Mind you, I can\u0027t swear to the last, but as for the rest: it is exactly as Wratha boasted of it to the other Ladies after the deed was done.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n \u0027She decked the walls with bronze - shields out of the olden times, when the Szgany had used to fight back, removed from the halls of Cragspire and burnished to mirrors - and all directed upon Karl in his stupor. And then ... then she threw wide the curtains!\\n\\n \u0027In a moment, Karl woke up screaming. But he was exhausted, drunk. He lolled upon his bed, chained down, and his cries were like the gonging of great cracked bells as his skin peeled back and his blood boiled! The sun\u0027s rays were concentrated in his eyes, which blackened to craters in his head! His hair became smoke, while his limbs and various parts cracked open to issue jets of steam and stench! And through all of this Wratha laughing like a madwoman in a shaded part of the room, dancing from one foot to the other in her excitement, and hauling on a rope which she had fixed to his bed, dragging Karl more surely into the focus of the sunlight.\\n\\n \u0027Karl\u0027s body shrank and shrivelled; he was finished; his leech deserted him, came wriggling from his trunk as finally he burst open at the belly. Seeing all of this, Wratha closed the curtains and rushed to Karl\u0027s bed, and took his cindered head with the same silver sword which she\u0027d used to slay Radu Cragsthrall!\\n\\n Then she turned to his vampire, which was also fatally burned and dying. In its final throes, the creature produced its egg - and at last Wratha had what she wanted! Of her own free will she opened herself to the thing, which entered her without pause and hid itself away in her flesh. It was done, and Wratha was or was about to become Wamphyri!\\n\\n \u0027Karl\u0027s warriors had been hauling on their chains from the moment of his first scream. Now one of them burst free and came hurrying to discover and destroy his master\u0027s tormentor. Wratha, consumed by that ecstasy of agony which ever attends the transfusion of an egg, nevertheless stood tall and showed herself to the creature. For her time in Cragspire had been well occupied, and she\u0027d made herself known to all of these children of Karl\u0027s vats. However dully, they had grown used to Wratha and responsive to her vampire techniques and aura; and so she\u0027d exercised her will over them, practising for this very day.\\n\\n \u0027Now the time had come when these preparations must be put to the ultimate test. Wratha faced the warrior down, shouted at it with voice and will both ... and the monster at once backed off! Then, knowing that she had won, Wratha ordered the warrior to a new post right there in a corner of Karl\u0027s bedroom; except that the room was now hers, no less than the warrior itself was Wratha\u0027s. For her will was abroad in all the corridors of Cragspire (soon to be Wrathspire), and Karl\u0027s other creatures were likewise quickly quelled.\\n\\n \u0027Beasts are beasts, however, and men are men, of which there were several sleeping in the spire. But Wratha\u0027s sigil - an unseemly device, to my mind -shows all too well what she thinks of men! She called for Karl\u0027s lieutenants one by one, showed herself and her handiwork to them, demanded their allegiance, their obedience. Some were common thralls, while others were undead vampires who had perhaps aspired to Karl\u0027s seat; whichever, none made objection. Let one so much as frown or make wry face, Wratha\u0027s attendant warrior would rumble and vent furious gases. And so now she was risen in every respect, Wratha of Wrath-spire, and ready to announce that fact.\\n\\n \u0027Come sundown, she sent out a lieutenant and flyer with messages of invitation to certain other Wamphyri Ladies, such as Zindevar Cronesap and Ursula Tor-spawn, informing them of a gathering in Wrathspire. Vastly intrigued, they all attended of course; but Wratha\u0027s special guest was Devetaki Skullguise, the so-called \"virgin grandam\" of Masquemanse, whom she much admired. Devetaki, when she was a thrall, had vied with a vampire girl for her master\u0027s egg. She won the ensuing fight but lost the right half of her pretty face, flensed from the cheekbone. Since when and to this very day, she wears gold-filigreed half-masks of lead: a smiling mask if her mood is good, and one which frowns when it is sour. In this way the two halves, both living and leaden, always concur. But being Devetaki, usually she wears the frowning mask. Ah, but when she is most angry, then she wears no mask at all...\\n\\n \u0027Well, I will make a long story short: the Ladies accepted their new sister (Zindevar of Cronespire, perhaps grudgingly), and following the Ladies the Lords. For after all, Wratha was Wamphyri now; which was, is, and presumably always will be the way of things. The route to ascension is not important, only the getting there. And it should be remembered: for every one of us born to the spires and manses, there is one who was born on Sunside or in the swamps.\\n\\n \u0027So Karl died, and Wratha was risen. Long live Wratha! In Turgosheim only a blind man or a fool would ask why beings who could live as long as the Wamphyri usually live so short.\\n\\n \u0027But who shall dictate otherwise, eh? As I\u0027ve said often enough before: we are not true masters but slaves to our parasites, and not even entirely to them but to blind Fate, who leads us all upon our teetering march across the abyss of life and undeath. Such is the nature of the Wamphyri, and jealousy, greed, hatred and lust - and blood - their way of life. So be it. Perhaps it\u0027s as well to leave it at that...\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Maglore paused, then said, \u0027Very well then, Karz Biteri, Historian, and now you know the history of Wratha the Risen.\u0027 Following which he sighed and fell silent.\\n\\n And in a while, Karz answered, \u0027For which I am grateful, Master. But if I may make so bold, all that you have told me was yesteryear - even a hundred years in the past - and this is today, when we know that the Lady Wratha breeds warriors in secret for the fighting of aerial battles. But against whom? Which man or men does she hate now, and to what new, even higher station does she aspire?\u0027\\n\\n Maglore looked at Karz and said, \u0027Hmm?\u0027 But he had heard him well enough. And he thought: Aye, a clever man and a fine brain, but perhaps a dangerous tongue. I\u0027ll grant you a year, Karz my friend, or two at most. After that: you\u0027ll retain some of your intelligence at least - but flyers aren\u0027t much sought after for their conversation.\\n\\n While out loud: \u0027Mark this well,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let there be no more frivolous discussion of things you may hear from time to time in Runemanse. And never again let the substance of my conversation form the body of yours. Not even with the best of motives or intentions. Do you hear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course, Lord. From now on I\u0027m deaf, dumb and blind.\u0027\\n\\n Smiling grimly, Maglore shook his head. \u0027Let dumb suffice,\u0027 he said. \u0027Which I can arrange, and swiftly, if you cannot!\\n\\n \u0027As for Wratha and certain forbidden flying things which I\u0027ve reason to believe she\u0027s breeding in the bowels of Wrathspire: she\u0027ll be called to give account soon enough. And not only Wratha but others I could name. As for now, let it rest.\\n\\n \u0027And as for me: I must rest, for it\u0027s sunup and I grow weary!\u0027 He stood up, and Karz backed away, bowing.\\n\\n \u0027Put these things of mine away,\u0027 Maglore told him, peering about his study workshop. \u0027Make all tidy, then return to your studies or tend your duties. Not least, prepare my good clothes, complete with chain and sigils. And my gauntlet: get the rust off it, if you can. Doubtless I shall be up and about from time to time during the long day, but be sure I am up at sundown!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Indeed, Lord!\u0027 Karz answered, who knew why his master must rise with the sinking of the sun, but in light of their conversation made no comment nor even thought about it, not until much later when Maglore was abed.\\n\\n Then: Looking out through a window and up at the spires and high crags, each one tipped gold in sunlight - and gazing far across the miles-wide gorge of Turgosheim, whose honeycombed walls contained the great manses, to where the pale lights of melancholy Vormspire still burned like glowworms despite that it was day - Karz did think about it, and wondered at its meaning. For it was this: That the Lord Vormulac Unsleep, who in his prime had been the most powerful of them all, and still retained a measure of his former might, had called a meeting in Vormspire in the second hour following twilight. And no simple gathering this, for all of the Wamphyri had been called, Lords and Ladies alike, with tithe-penalties for any who might think to abstain.\\n\\n Aye, times were changing in Turgosheim; Karz Biteri could feel it in his water! And he fancied that soon there\u0027d be new histories to write, possibly even in blood ...\\n\\n Lord Vormulac Taintspore, called Unsleep after his insomnia of seventy years, had seated himself at the head of the great table; this was only proper, for he was convenor and host both. Tithemaster, adjudicator and \u0027aesthete\u0027 (the word must be read in the same light as \u0027ascetic\u0027 as applied to Maglore, insofar as such words may be said to apply to any of the Wamphyri), Vormulac was greatly respected... generally.\\n\\n He was no strict adherent to Zolteism, but neither was he a glutton. He had not dealt his fellow Lords ill, not even in his prime. His forces had never attacked, other than to defend Vormspire; but when they had made war, then it had been utter and ruthless! Eighty years ago, Vormulac had lain Gonarspire and Trog-manse to waste, decked their masters in silver chains and hung them from their own battlements to await the rising sun\u0027s hot melt. Since when Turgosheim had stayed relatively free from internal feuding.\\n\\n In aspect: Vormulac had kept his shaved head and thrall\u0027s forelocks for all of a hundred and thirty years. What had suited his old master Engor Sporeson in that earlier time had suited Vormulac ever since. His own thralls were similarly cropped, including the women. His forelocks, having lost most of their jet sheen through long years of sleeplessness, were iron-grey; they were plaited and finished with tassles, which dangled down on to his nipples. His eyes, not quite uniformly crimson but marked with curious yellow flecks, were close-set and deep-sunken in ochre orbits.\\n\\n Vormulac\u0027s nose was long and thin, and sharply hooked at the bridge; it might be that in some former time it had been badly broken. Its convolutions and the gape of its nostrils were less marked than in most of the Wamphyri, but its great length was a singular anomaly, with a pointed tip which came down almost to the centre of his upper lip and lent his frown a hawkish severity. He wore iron-grey moustaches which dipped at their ends to meet the \u0027V of his goatish beard, and within this boundary of bristles his mouth was wide, thin as a gash, and held slightly but not cynically aslant. He wore a thin white scar in the hollow of his left cheek, from the orbit of his eye to the corner of his mouth, which might account for the latter\u0027s tilt. His ears lay flat to his head, and their conch-like whorls were tufted with coarse white hair.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n A huge man, he stood almost seven feet tall. The histories had it that gigantism was common among the olden Wamphyri, when some had reached eight feet and more! Vormulac was happy with his seven, which were especially advantageous on occasions such as this. Since the seat of his chair was also an inch or two higher than the rest of them about the table, he made an imposing figure indeed.\\n\\n And yet, overall, Vormulac\u0027s face and form were as melancholy in aspect as Vormspire itself, and the aura of his rooms, furniture, and tapestries - despite their richness, intricacy and questionable \u0027beauty\u0027 - was likewise doleful. Neither overtly dull nor doom-fraught as such, yet full of some sad nostalgia, theirs was a silent conspiracy to evoke visions of fled or stolen youth, mordant mistakes, and everlasting poignancy.\\n\\n Maglore, Vormulac\u0027s contemporary down the years, knew the reason well enough. So might several of the others if they had cared to mark and remember such things; but in a world without proper records, time itself becomes an efficient eraser.\\n\\n The reason was this: That in his youth, after Vormulac received the dying Engor Sporeson\u0027s egg and ascended in his turn to Vormspire, and while still he retained something of Szgany humanity, he had returned to Sunside to reclaim the love of a sweetheart lost when he\u0027d been taken as a titheling. She had come back with him to Vormspire, where their passion was such that in a very short time his vampire, however immature, produced an egg which passed to her through intercourse.\\n\\n Alas, what Vormulac\u0027s former master had not told him was this: that he, Engor, was a leper!\\n\\n The Wamphyri, whose metamorphic flesh shrugged off most of the common Szgany diseases, were prone to leprosy. While it made itself manifest in several forms and was little understood, they believed that one strain at least was genetic and passed on through the egg. It might skip one or more generations, but sooner or later must recur somewhere down the line. In the Lord of Vormspire\u0027s case it had skipped just one generation: his own.\\n\\n After several years, when his love\u0027s flesh had taken on the hue of decay and begun to slough (and only then recalling his former master\u0027s swift deterioration and death), Vormulac had opened Engor\u0027s mausoleum to see if he might discover some clue there. Within, Engor\u0027s body lay in many crumbling pieces, with more than sufficient evidence to show how the filthy rot had continued to work on his flesh - from his leech outwards -even after he himself was dead!\\n\\n Then, to make a quick end of it, Vormulac had poisoned his exhausted, ravaged love with kneblasch and silver, and placed her body with Engor\u0027s in the mausoleum. The tomb had then been fired like an oven; when all was cold again it had been sealed up - forever. From which day forward Vormulac had dreamed of her burning, and of his own flesh slowly softening, until he\u0027d vowed to sleep and dream no more. Well, and he hadn\u0027t slept, but it was Maglore\u0027s belief that he still dreamed.\\n\\n The story accounted for the first of his self-given names, Taintspore, likewise for the melancholy aspect which both he and Vormspire wore like shrouds ...\\n\\n These were some of Maglore\u0027s thoughts and memories where he sat at Vormulac\u0027s right hand at the head of the table. And as their host named and formally introduced the other guests (such introductions were mainly unnecessary, for each knew the others well enough; it was simply a formality, by way of starting the proceedings), so the Mage of Runemanse also considered them:\\n\\n \u0027The Lady Zindevar of Cronespire,\u0027 Vormulac intoned, his voice gritty as gravel. And, with some small effort at gallantry: \u0027Never in all her years more ... more beautiful.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 she snorted, and her eyes flashed fire at him. \u0027All what years, pray?\u0027\\n\\n Vormulac shrugged. \u0027A handful of handfuls, Lady,\u0027 he made amends, however drily. \u0027And after all, what are a few years to the Wamphyri? Why, you are the merest girl!\u0027\\n\\n Much to Maglore\u0027s dismay, Zindevar was seated on his immediate right, and she was no \u0027mere girl\u0027 but a contemporary. When he had come out of the swamps that time (\u0027lowborn\u0027, as it were, a Szgany mystic who went into the forbidden places to meditate, breathed a spore and came out Wamphyri), Zindevar had already ascended to Cronespire. Then she had been young, but even then she had not been beautiful!\\n\\n She was squat, hairy, of lesbian persuasions, and the atmosphere about her pervaded with a manly odour which all her many perfumes together could never hope to obscure. And despite her years - whose number fell far short of Vormulac\u0027s and exceeded Maglore\u0027s - she looked young or in her middle years at most, which said a deal for her mode of life. Zindevar was no great \u0027ascetic\u0027.\\n\\n Rouged and painted, with her elbows on the table and one hand scratching at her chin while the clawlike fingers of the other rapped upon the old oak, there was this overpowering air of aggression about her, this impatience, this great disdain - mainly of men, Maglore supposed. He could scarcely contain the urge to shrink his nostrils and creep away from the touch - even from the thought - of that great fat thigh of hers bulging against his where they sat at table. And he refrained from more than a glance into her mind, which was full of breasts and behinds of various shapes and styles; and red-rimmed, yawning, pulsating orifices; and blood, of course. But the worst of it lay in knowing that he shunned the lascivious display of her mind not so much because it was disgusting, but because it was seductive! For whatever his alleged sensitivities, Maglore was Wamphyri no less than the Lady Zindever herself.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n As for the mainly derisory agnomen \u0027Cronesap\u0027: while its use was common among the Wamphyri, it was never used to Zindevar\u0027s face except as a deliberate insult; for which reason Vormulac had avoided it. It referred to the way in which she had ascended: by gradually sapping the blood and energy of the ancient Lady who had occupied her aerie before her. Nor was she any different now, as her many female thralls could doubtless testify. Only a handful of her lieutenants were men in the fullest sense of the word (necessary for the protection, maintenance and administration of Cronespire), and even then she kept an equal number of female officers, to guarantee a balance. As for Cronespire\u0027s menials: all of its males were eunuchs to ... to a creature.\\n\\n So much for Zindevar; Maglore had missed several cursory introductions of lesser lights; even now Vormulac was moving on again:\\n\\n \u0027Now I bring to your attention the Lord Grigor Hakson of Gauntmanse,\u0027 he said, \u0027with whom we commiserate; his get from the draw these several tithes has been scarcely sufficient to his needs.\u0027 Grigor, tall, thin and shifty-eyed, nodded sourly, perfunctorily, all about the table, then returned to examining his fingernails. \u0027Following these proceedings,\u0027 Vormulac continued, \u0027and in the event there are persons present who would care to barter with him, Lord Grigor will doubtless make himself available in the pursuit of a mutually advantageous deal or two.\u0027\\n\\n Maglore leaned forward a little to scan down the table at Grigor of Gauntmanse, or \u0027Grigor the Lech\u0027 as he was known. One of the younger Lords and full of lust, recently his share of the Sunside tithelings - of the lottery in human lives - had been low in women; almost without exception his tokens had matched up with Szgany males, of which he had plenty. Maglore read it in his mind how tonight, if Grigor could find a taker, he would offer four strong men for just two half-decent girls! Someone would make a killing, certainly. In other circumstances it might well be the Lady Wratha. Except, and as Maglore knew, tonight she\u0027d be otherwise engaged.\\n\\n So the introductions went on, and next came Canker Canison. To see the Lord of Mangemanse was to know that somewhere in his ancestry was a spore-infected dog or fox. Named for the disease of the inner ear which had driven his father baying mad (till mounting a flyer he\u0027d soared south into the rising sun), Canker had caused the fleshy lobes and fine whorls of his own ears to fret themselves into curious and intricate designs, including his sigil, a sickle moon. His hair was red and the gape of his jaws vast; his long-striding walk was more a lope; when laughing, he would throw back his head and shake tip to toe.\\n\\n Lorn Halfstruck: The Lord of Trollmanse was a dwarf among the Wamphyri, with legs which were stunted to little more than thighs with feet. But with his barrel chest, hands like grapples, and arms almost as long as himself, any who would think to belittle him must maintain a safe distance. His reach was phenomenal, and he knew the vulnerability of a man\u0027s essential parts ...\\n\\n Vasagi the Suck, who was likewise deviant of form: Vasagi was the victim of an hereditary bone disease. The small handful of Wamphyri diseases were mainly hereditary: various animalisms, several forms of insanity, aggressive autisms, acromegaly and other bone disorders; though with the exception of leprosy, they were rarely fatal. But when the growth of Vasagi\u0027s jaws and teeth had threatened to outstrip the metamorphic flesh of his face, then he\u0027d simply extruded them. Which is to say, he\u0027d stripped his upper jaw of teeth, unhinged his lower jaw, withdrawn all flesh from the offending bones and so been rid of them. Now, chinless, his mouth was a tapering pale pink tentacle tipped with a flexible needle siphon, not unlike the proboscis of a bee, which he could slide into the finest vein with amazing dexterity. Needless to say, he was not an ascetic.\\n\\n So the list went: Ursula Torspawn of Tormanse, who affected an almost human guise even to the extent of wearing Sun-sider clothes, with all their leather tassles and tinkling bells (but bells of tin, not silver). Yet at one and the same time, she swore by the use of the rendered fats of Szgany women as lotions to hold at bay the sag and scathe of more than a century, and kept preserved various mementoes of her lovers down all those long years ... in jars. It must be stated, however, that Ursula had not availed herself of these souvenirs while yet their owners lived. For despite that she knew the toll to be paid for the denial of her Wamphyri flesh, she was Zolteist to a point, whose nature was neither cruel nor entirely sanguinary.\\n\\n The list extended itself: Lord Eran Painscar; Lady Valeria of Valspire; the Lord Tangiru; Zun of Zunspire; Gorvi the Guile; the Lady Devetaki Skullguise (who today, for whatever reason, wore her smiling mask); Wran the Rage and his brother Spiro Killglance of Madmanse ... all of these and many more. Thirty-six Lords in all and seven Ladies. The introductions took the best part of an hour. And all the while Maglore aware of Zindevar\u0027s growing impatience, and of her hot fat thigh against his; and all of their various thoughts impinging upon his own, until he could reel from the innuendoes and infamies, the dooms and desires of their collective mind.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n They kept the bulk of their thoughts suppressed, of course, for the Lord of Runemanse was not unique in telepathic skills. All of the Wamphyri had them to some extent; at the very least, they could sense the direction of another\u0027s thoughts. Zindevar, for instance: That Lady was as much aware of Maglore\u0027s close presence as he was of hers, which might well account for her impatience and the lewd scenes with which she filled her mind. She\u0027d probably reckoned, and correctly, that these would suffice to keep him out.\\n\\n Taken with the idea, he glanced at her from the corner of his eye - and caught her staring back at him! Her eyes were hot and burned on him, and her nostrils pinched with suspicion. So then, and what did she have to hide?\\n\\n But by now Vormulac had reached an end, and only one was left to announce: Wratha the Risen. Maglore put all else out of mind in order to concentrate on the Tithemaster\u0027s introduction: The Lady Wratha,\u0027 Vormulac intoned, narrowing his eyes, \u0027of Wrathspire ...\u0027 But now there was an edge to his gravelly tone, so that all fidgeting and murmuring stopped at once and all eyes turned to Wratha - which was no great hardship.\\n\\n Maglore looked along the table to where she was seated at the very end facing Vormulac down its great length, and knew that he had never seen her looking more ... delicious, indeed edible! And in that selfsame moment the mental ether was full of two waves of thought: one of lust, and the other a jealous loathing. No need to search for the origins of such sweeping emotions. Ah, but the crests of both waves foamed with something of respect, too, and even admiration! Aye, for Wratha the Risen had style.\\n\\n She had not seated herself properly in her chair but was curled there, entirely at ease, with both elbows on one rest and her hands supporting her chin. Her hair fell in plaits almost to her shoulders, which were fitted with a torque of finely worked gold. Depending from this golden harness, ropes of black bat fur hung down vertically to form a smoky curtain. Wratha\u0027s pale shoulders showed through, likewise her arms, the points of her tilted breasts, a large area of immaculate thigh and her knees where her legs were folded. Seen as pale curving stripes through dusty black bars, the rest of her was scarcely secure from viewing.\\n\\n Paradoxically but not unusually, Wratha\u0027s eyes were least in evidence; they were protected by the scarp of figured bone upon her brow, their fire subdued by the ornamentation of blue glass ovals at her temples, and matching earrings where they dangled from the fine-furred lobes of her ears. But apart from her Wamphyri ears and the tilted, somewhat flattened aspect of her nose, whose convolutions were not exaggerated to any great degree - and the red-flickering fork of her tongue, of course - apart from these things, she might well be Szgany: a clean-limbed Gypsy girl from Sunside, whose flesh was still untried, just as she must have appeared to Karl the Crag almost a hundred years ago.\\n\\n Except... where was Karl now?\\n\\n A few chairs away from Maglore, Grigor Hakson made small choking noises deep in his throat, which Maglore sensed rather than heard. He turned his attention to the Lord of Gauntmanse, whose mind was now an open book. If I could have her (Grigor lusted for all he was worth). Ah, that mouth.\u0027 And how I would fill it! She beds Szgany whelps, so whelmed by her curves they dribble on her thigh. But if I could have her ... my liquids would scald her like steam, even to the core!\\n\\n Maglore scanned no more; in any case, they were all thinking much the same thoughts. The men, at least. As for the women: they thought other things. Devetaki Skullguise was amused, well in keeping with her mask; one or two others were envious, their glances sour; Zindevar of Cronespire thought: Pale and skinny bitch! Szgany whore.\u0027 She shows herself to men, gives herself to men! And to think... upon a time I even thought to have her for myself! Well, let leprosy rot her softest parts, and worms crawl in all her openings!\\n\\n \u0027Aye, Wratha the Risen,\u0027 Vormulac repeated, his eyes staring and forelocks beginning to quiver. \u0027Whom some might say has risen too far!\u0027 He put his great hands on the table as if ready to come to his feet; and farthest away from him, Wratha likewise straightened up and lowered her feet to the floor.\\n\\n \u0027If your tone and words have any meaning, Lord Vormulac,\u0027 she hissed, \u0027then perhaps you\u0027d better explain it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Better?\u0027 the flesh at the corner of his mouth twitched, tugging at his beard. \u0027Better!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I came here at the polite behest of a Lord!\u0027 Her voice was also rising. \u0027It is not the case that some ... some swaggering lieutenant lout has crooked his finger at me, and like a scullery girl I have hastened to his beck. What? I am the Lady Wratha! Not some Sunside slut to be bullied, abused, and ... and insulted! \"Risen too far\", indeed!\u0027\\n\\n As Wratha\u0027s blood grew heated, so she herself changed. It was her vampire, reacting to her emotions, her anger, pumping its essence into her veins in the same way that lesser mortals pump adrenalin. For she had sensed that she was to be something of a focus here, and this was her response: to gird herself for whatever was in the offing.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Without so much as blinking an eye, she gained inches in height as her flesh and bones stretched, so that she seemed to grow in her chair. Her cheeks shrank inwards, ageing her face to gauntness in a moment. The ridges of her nose took on clear definition; its flat flange turned darkly moist, with nostrils which flared and gaped. Her breasts, beautiful and girlish one moment, in the next became wrinkled, fell flat, withdrew under the bat-fur ropes of her gown. And her eyes ...\\n\\n ....ittle wonder she keeps them hooded! thought Maglore. For now beneath the carved cowl of bone upon her brow, Wratha\u0027s eyes were blobs of hellfire, starting like scarlet plums from their sockets.\\n\\n Among the Wamphyri there had always been those of hybrid origin; their mutations were many; their meta-morphism allowed transmutation into endless varieties of form. But few manifestations were ghastly as the Lady Wratha\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n It was mainly that she had no control over it: only anger or threaten her, and this was the result. It was nothing that she willed; rather, it was something she would unwill, if that were possible. For it was this -this swift transformation from a girl into a demonic thing - which even the most hardened Wamphyri Lord found monstrous and, yes, unnatural. Well, and its cause had been unnatural, as Maglore knew well enough.\\n\\n Reading minds the way he did, he\u0027d long since learned the source of it, which lay one hundred years in the past, in the time of Wratha\u0027s premature burial. For it was then, awakening from death to undeath in her cavern tomb, that Wratha\u0027s eyes had first started in this way. Except hers was no mere claustrophobia of the flesh, nor even of the mind, but of her leech itself. Oh, it reacted like all vampires to threat or pressure -by fighting, or by attempting to break out or away from the immediate hazard - but it reacted more so, and more violently. For in the time of her entombment, Wratha had been driven partially mad, which madness had later transferred to her parasite. And now, host and leech alike, their moods and sporadic rages were fused inseparably.\\n\\n Guilty as sin itself! Vormulac thought, where he sat and trembled with fury and outrage at the head of the table. The reaction of her leech, and of her flesh, is at once apparent.\u0027 She gives herself away, in front of everyone. Her accusers, myself included, are correct in their every suspicion. Except, I have gone too fast; this is not going the way Maglore, Devetaki and I planned it. Where lore and for the moment I must back off. But how?\\n\\n The Lady of Masquemanse came to Vormulac\u0027s rescue, though whether by chance or design Maglore couldn\u0027t say; but he did note that Devetaki had replaced her smiling mask with one that frowned. And now, tut-tutting, and glancing from the tail of the table to its head and back again, she said:\\n\\n \u0027But Wratha - ah, Wratha my child - and why is your mood so poor tonight? The Lord Vormulac intended no slight or accusation, I\u0027m sure, but merely stated a fact. For as you yourself must be aware, there are several here who do envy you that you are risen so high, even as Vormulac intimated. You know it and so do we all, for they protest your status at every opportunity. So? But they protest mine also, and even Vormulac\u0027s! And isn\u0027t that just the way of things? Why, we are all full of such petty jealousies, of one thing or another! And surely it\u0027s better to be envied than ignored.\u0027\\n\\n Clever! thought Maglore, who now saw how Devetaki deliberately cooled the proceedings, not only giving Vormulac the chance to make amends but also allowing time for their scheme to take its proper course, both within and without this meeting. For it would never do to have the Lady Wratha leave in a huff - not now, at this very moment - and perhaps discover for herself how the wind blew. Yes, very clever! For Maglore likewise knew that Devetaki Skullguise of Masquemanse was one of Wratha\u0027s principal accusers.\\n\\n Devetaki had been there - indeed, she had been here, right here in Vormspire, with Maglore and Vormulac, contemporaries with whom she formed a covert Wamphyri triumvirate - at that secret meeting where this meeting had been decided. Here, in the privacy of Vormspire\u0027s upper levels, at that uncomfortable but secure hour of sunup when the peak\u0027s exterior was blasted by scorching rays, they\u0027d convened to discuss ... Wratha! Then Devetaki had told how certain unnamed informers had warned her of Wratha\u0027s works, which were such that they must be brought to the attention of the others; all of which transgressions, when they were described, coincided with Maglore\u0027s own fears and convictions, accruing mainly from his mind-spying.\\n\\n Thus Devetaki, no less than Maglore, had brought charges against Wratha; but at the same time she\u0027d vetoed all but the mildest of the corrective or punitive measures which Vormulac had then proposed. Sufficient that Wratha\u0027s new breed of warriors be destroyed, she said, and the Lady herself warned off from any further experimentation. Like measures must also be taken against a handful of younger Lords, whom Wrath-spire\u0027s Lady had allegedly inveigled into producing similar beasts of their own. So it had become apparent that Devetaki still \u0027liked\u0027 or \u0027cared for\u0027 Wratha, despite that she\u0027d informed on her.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Of course, the question had also arisen as to why Wratha needed such aerial warriors? To protect herself? But against whom? Or ... could it be that she planned for war?\\n\\n Here Devetaki and Maglore had agreed that the Lady did not appear especially ambitious in respect of Turgosheim itself, not yet. But from Maglore\u0027s mindreading and Devetaki\u0027s sources, they had gathered that she intended to strike west - into Old Starside! At last Turgosheim\u0027s precincts had become too narrow, too constraining. The younger Lords would break out, and Wratha would lead them.\\n\\n All very well, but in the unlikely event that the Old Wamphyri were still mighty in Starside, Wratha could only betray the presence of those here in Turgosheim! And if she and the younger Lords lost their fight against them, how long before those great and practised warriors came seeking her place of origin? Conversely, if Wratha found Olden Starside deserted and settled there, how long before she\u0027d build armies of her own with which to return to Turgosheim, this time as a warrior queen? Ah, for she was quite the one for rising up and returning, this Wratha!\\n\\n Therefore, to simply let her go and to hell with her was out of the question. Wratha was headstrong, even \u0027wicked\u0027 ... they dared not let her get away with it, and take the chance that in some not so distant future she\u0027d make them pay for it. Vormulac, Devetaki and Maglore, they would go ahead and apply their agreed sanctions. But in order to do so, first they must arrange and provide the distraction of a gathering of all the Wamphyri together: this gathering. Which was how it had come about...\\n\\n Such were Maglore\u0027s thoughts, which had centred (perhaps too centrally) on Devetaki Skullguise. For while reminiscing in the aftermath of Devetaki\u0027s conciliatory speech, so he\u0027d unconsciously swept her mind with a telepathic probe. And: Is there no privacy? Devetaki asked him directly, suddenly, and without changing her expression or even glancing in his direction.\\n\\n Eh? Maglore gave a start, and at once apologized: Excuse me, dear Lady, but I was carried away by the proceedings.\\n\\n Devetaki was a telepath in her own right, a mentalist of no meagre talent, and so knew that Maglore\u0027s apology was sincere. Also, he was an old \u0027colleague\u0027. Nevertheless: Hands off my mind, Maglore.\u0027 she warned. Drift in the feeble, shallow thoughts of others all you will and catch what sprats you can. But beware the swirly deeps, for there dwell great and vicious fishes!\\n\\n Ah! - indeed, he agreed, and hurriedly moved on. All of which, like his reminiscing, had been the substance of mental processes, literally as swift as thought. But meanwhile:\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Wratha had unwound somewhat. Now she let herself slump down a little in her chair. Some semblance of youth had crept back into her looks; her narrowed eyes were hidden again under the bone scarp upon her forehead; her body was gradually recovering its previous blush, however pale. And her voice, no longer hissing but a chime, reached out all along the great table to Vormulac. \u0027And has the Lady of Masquemanse read it aright?\u0027\\n\\n Vormulac knew how he would like to answer, but must not. He nodded instead, however curtly, and added creatively, \u0027But it is your nature, Wratha - something in the way you ... posture? - to make yourself a great distraction. We have serious matters to discuss here. I desire that these Lords give all of their attention to me, and in a moment to Maglore. Alas, but a good deal of their attention - far too much of it - goes to you!\u0027\\n\\n No more! Grigor of Gauntmanse gave a mental shudder. He had heard tales of Wratha\u0027s awesome retrogressions but never before witnessed one. I am saved in the nick of time. She is a hag!\\n\\n Wratha, however, seemed appeased. She pouted a little, then deliberately took up her former relaxed and revealing position, that \u0027posture\u0027 to which Vormulac had referred.\\n\\n Maglore, allowing himself a wry grin, glanced out of the corner of his eye at Zindevar. Aha! she was thinking. These men! But they are all alike: dogs who shag uselessly against the thighs of trogs. Except now they have seen this \u0027Lady\u0027 as she really is: a great crone! Hah! Well, and I, Zindevar, have dealt with crones before! This Wratha ... she should be fed to the beasts which she breeds in her not-so-secret vats! Ah, if only I could have persuaded Devetaki to a like solution ...\\n\\n This told Maglore something and at the same time explained Zindevar\u0027s impatience and furtiveness, the way she shielded her mind against intrusion. Quite obviously, she was one of Devetaki\u0027s informants in respect of Wratha\u0027s illegal activities. But since Zindevar was known to operate a spy network second to none among Turgosheim\u0027s spires and manses, this hardly came as any great surprise.\\n\\n As to why Zindevar should be so keen to conceal her part in all of this ... two reasons, possibly. One: she feared the Mistress of Wrathspire\u0027s reprisal, should she emerge unscathed. (Aye, for Wratha had a good many men at her disposal, while Zindevar\u0027s crew were mainly women.) Two: despite that Zindevar was an envious bloodbag, she didn\u0027t much relish her ugly reputation as a sapper of crones and a curse on her own sex in general. Or, if she did relish it, still she would seek to disguise the fact. So that where on the one hand Wratha must be considered corrupt, Zindevar on the other was devious to a fault!\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Ah, well (and the Mage of Runemanse gave a mental shrug), no one was perfect...\\n\\n Meanwhile, things had simmered down. All around the table, the Wamphyri were taking wine and a little raw red meat - the halved hearts of suckling wolves, Maglore noted - to moisten their throats. He glanced from one face to the next, penetrating to their thoughts when and wherever he could.\\n\\n Wratha\u0027s mind was shielded. As was her wont, she conjured thick banks of fog in her head to exclude unwanted mental attentions. Wratha was no great telepath but knew how to block the stuff. Perhaps understandably, there were several others around the table who employed similar devices: Zindevar of Cronespire, of course, with her crudely lascivious gallery; but also Vasagi the Suck? Canker Canison? The brothers Wran and Spiro of Madmanse? Gorvi the Guile? Strange bedfellows, these! Or were they?\\n\\n Maglore nodded knowingly, if only to himself. Oh, yes, they\u0027d be careful, all right, this bunch. For they were in it to a man, even as deep as Wratha herself! Aye, for these were those selfsame Lords which she had inveigled. And their minds were clamped shut like lichens to rocks.\\n\\n But ... might that not indicate that they knew, or at least suspected, that something was in the wind? And indeed Wratha had been quick off the mark, when in his anger Vormulac had almost given the show away. No time to worry about it now, however, for on Maglore\u0027s left Vormulac was on his feet and holding up his arms to quiet the murmur. And:\\n\\n \u0027Now to business,\u0027 Vormspire\u0027s Master grunted. \u0027But first, in order to refresh your memories with regard to the background of the matter in hand, allow me to reintroduce Maglore of Runemanse, whose knowledge of our history, from Turgosheim\u0027s humble beginnings to the present day, is unsurpassed. I give you the Seer Lord Maglore.\u0027\\n\\n As Vormulac sat down, so Maglore climbed creaking to his feet. Now it was his turn to keep the show going. Ah, but if only he could be sure that it wasn\u0027t already over ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-9.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \\n The vampires have been vanquished!
