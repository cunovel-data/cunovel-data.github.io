{"id":80290,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"And: \u0027Wamphyri!\u0027 Glina breathed, when they had gone.\n Wamphyri.\u0027 The word burned like cold fire.\n Nestor looked at her. He was pale; there was recognition, a question in his eyes. His mouth twitched a little, and spoke at last. \u0027Wamphyri?\u0027\n \u0027Shhh!\u0027 she cautioned, despite that they had gone.\n Seconds passed and he spoke again, urgently. \u0027Wamphyri?\u0027\n Brad Berea came rushing along the path from the cabin. He was buttoning his jacket, his breath forming plumes in the suddenly cold air. \u0027Nestor ... and Glina!\u0027 He brushed Nestor aside, fell on his daughter and hugged her. \u0027We heard them - their warriors - and I knew you were out here. But we\u0027re well hidden away in the trees and they passed us by, again ...\u0027\n Nestor took his arm, and Brad looked at him in surprise. \u0027Eh?\u0027 he said. \u0027What\u0027s this? Life in the dummy? Has it scared some wits into him, then?\u0027\n \u0027Again?\u0027 said Nestor. \u0027They\u0027ve passed us by, again?\u0027\n \u0027A yellow mocklark!\u0027 Brad grunted. \u0027He repeats my words like a bird, without understanding a one of them!\u0027\n \u0027Wamphyri!\u0027 Nestor suddenly shouted, and grabbed Brad by the throat. But Brad was strong, and now that the danger was past he was also angry. He tripped Nestor and knocked him flying into the bushes.\n \u0027Father!\u0027 Glina cried. \u0027He was only frightened!\u0027 But she wondered ... Nestor\u0027s eyes had been so strange watching those monsters fly overhead . .. she had sensed his fascination.\n Nestor stood up and she took his arm. \u0027Aye, look after him,\u0027 her father grunted, turning back toward the cabin. Tor if he goes for me again you\u0027ll be tending his cracked skull a second time!\u0027\n As he faded into the darkness, Nestor whispered: \u0027Again? Have they passed ... before?\u0027\n \u0027When you were sick,\u0027 she told him. \u0027It was like tonight, just an hour or so after the sun was down. They had been doing some early hunting. We saw them heading home again, toward the Northstar, which shines on Starside\u0027s last aerie.\u0027\n The Northstar!\u0027 he said, turning his head unerringly in that direction, and gazing at the evilly glittering star, frozen like a chunk of ice over the barrier range. \u0027Heading home. The Wamphyri...\u0027\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 she said, almost dragging him along the path. \u0027Let\u0027s get in.\u0027\n But not far from the cabin she pushed him against a tree and felt to see if there was life in him yet. There was still time, barely. Sometimes, even though she\u0027d had him more than once, he would be ready; but not tonight. And as she took his hand again and led him back to the cabin, still his eyes were fixed on the low silhouette of the mountains, and the star of ill-omen which lit them. And in Nestor\u0027s mind, all unheard: Home - the Northstar- the last aerie - the Wamphyri! Compared to which, the lure of Glina\u0027s body was nothing ...\n He left the cabin silently, in the long night. And when Glina woke up to answer a call of nature she saw his bed, empty.\n Such a howling then! It woke up the two in the loft. Her father came down and told her: \u0027What, gone? But he\u0027ll probably be back ... if not, good riddance! Only one master here, Glina, and I don\u0027t much care for a dog that bites his master\u0027s hand.\u0027\n Then, seeing that Nestor had taken a crossbow and knife, he cursed him long and loud. But what the hell: it wasn\u0027t his good crossbow. And certainly the idiot would need some protection, out there on his own in the night.\n In a while Brad went back to bed, and even through Glina\u0027s sobbing he slept like a baby ...\n Lured irresistibly by the Northstar, Nestor travelled through the night-dark woods. Where streams were shallow he waded them, and where gullies looked dangerous he skirted around. But always his point of reference was the ice-chip star glittering cold on the barrier mountains. Beyond those mountains lay Starside, the last aerie, home of the Wamphyri. And now that he had seen them again, soaring dark against the night, at last everything had seemed to come together.\n Nestor knew he\u0027d been there before; he couldn\u0027t remember the circumstances, but he had been there. Perhaps Starside was his source, his origin. Certainly it was his destiny. Maybe he was an outcast, a changeling freak banished from his own kind to make his way as best he might in the world. Well, and now he was on his way back again.\n As for Sunside: He had enemies here; he must be careful along the way; men had pursued him, hurt him, would kill him if they could! He had scars to prove it. And he remembered ... things. All of his time with the Bereas, he had remembered them but could not, dared not, speak of them. Once, without thinking, he had told Brad Berea, \u0027I am the Lord Nestor.\u0027 But after that he\u0027d said no more. For like his many unfocused thoughts and memories, his tongue was a traitor; it would betray him; there had been enough of betrayals already.\n Once, he had a friend, a so-called \u0027brother\u0027, a child who played with him when he himself was a child. But he had been a traitor whose cheating thoughts were hidden behind a screen of numbers, which he\u0027d used like a plague to torment Nestor, even in his dreams. Now: that one was his greatest enemy!\n Once, Nestor had loved a girl, who did not love him back. She, too, was treacherous. But like it or not she would \u0027love\u0027 him one day. And she would die loving him. It was his vow.\n Once, he had had a flyer. He remembered its fate: boiling away into rottenness in the hills. He also remembered taking a bolt in his side; and the river whose cold caresses had nearly drowned him; and Glina, whose warm caresses had given him his manhood. If she had known who and what he was ... perhaps she would not have been so eager. Not even the homely Glina.\n I am the Lord Nestor, of the Wamphyri!\n But a Lord in exile, stripped of his powers, who was now returning home ...\n He trekked through all the hours of night, effortlessly. Given purpose, he was tireless. But there would be time enough for sleep in the daylight, before moving on again towards his Starside destination. And always the North-star tugging at him, and the miles flying under his feet.\n He let instinct guide him. Only set his sights on that bright blue ice-shard in the sky, and let his body take over . .. the idea itself would do the rest. The hours sped by to match the miles; eventually his footsteps faltered; his body was not as tireless as he\u0027d thought.\n He drank from a stream, washed the grit of the forest from his eyes, sat down with his back to a tree. Almost without knowing it he slept, and woke up shivering, lost, wondering where he was. But the Northstar was there, and the idea lived again. As he got his limbs in motion, so his hot blood pounded and soon he was warm.\n He came upon an encampment of Szgany. There were guards out, with at least one wolf. No doubt alerted by their watchdog, the men heard him, called out a password; Nestor made no answer but hurried on. They released their animal, which came bounding in his tracks and found him at once. He turned snarling, aimed his bolt right down its throat. But ... the wolf wagged its tail, came sniffing, jumped up to lick his face! Dimly then, Nestor remembered how he and ... he and ... one other (someone close? But he had no one who was close!) had had a way with canines. As a child, wild dogs had come out of the woods to play with him; domesticated wolves, \u0027guard dogs\u0027 like this one, had permitted the very roughest of games without turning on him; wild wolves in the hills had moved cautiously, but without animosity, out of his path.\n He\u0027d never made anything of it. Nor did he now. Indeed, he saw the wolf\u0027s friendliness as a stupid mistake. He wasn\u0027t Szgany. He was the Lord Nestor! But he was one and they were many, and they would be smarter than their tame wolf.\n He moved on ...\n In the night he wasted a deal of time: sleeping, trekking around obstacles, getting mired in this or that bog. But seen through breaks in the trees, black against the dark-blue sky and ice-blue stars, the mountains drew ever closer. Likewise the dawn.\n Where the forest thinned out and grew into foothills he rested a while, gazed out over Sunside and saw the first pale blush of light on the horizon. Hours yet to the true dawn, and more to go to sunup, but this was the start of it. Nestor had no fear of the sun: it was part of his freakishness, that the sun had no power over him. His flyer had not been so fortunate. That . .. puzzled him, but it was so.\n He seemed to remember a pass through the mountains. But where would that lie? To the east or to the west? He thought east. But as he made to follow an old and half-familiar trail through the foothills -\n - A sound, even movement up ahead! Grey shadows in the pre-dawn dusk, which was as yet much closer to night than day. Nestor loped silently through a ground mist swirling round his ankles like a disturbed shroud. On his right hand, the forest, and on his left the foothills rising towards the barrier range. But up there where the way was steep: something huge, grey and weird, projecting over the rim of a bluff, nodding and swaying against the dark-blue sky. It scanned the night with dull, disinterested eyes in a diamond-shaped head at the end of a long, tapering neck. An unmistakable design: a flyer! Ideally situated for launching, it waited there. Which could mean only one thing: that somewhere down here its vampire master, a Lord or lieutenant of the Wamphyri, was even now abroad in the night!\n Night for the moment, aye, but dawn was fast approaching. Whoever was the beast\u0027s keeper, he\u0027d have to be back soon. If he was not already here ...\n Desiring to see without being seen, to know without being known, Nestor went more quietly yet. He moved like a cat along the trail, and keeping to the darkest shadows passed under the flyer in its launch site. But in a while, higher up the slope and vague in the deceptive light, he saw a second creature. So, two of the flying beasts, and apparently no one in attendance. It could only be a small hunting party.\n Though it seemed unlikely that such dull, stupid creatures would be used as observers, still Nestor took no chances but kept himself hidden anyway. A further fifty paces, and . .. what was that down there, where an outcrop of boulders tumbled to meet the trees? A fire?\n It was a fire, flickering red and yellow in the lee of boulders; smoke rising in a grey spiral, carrying a whiff of roasting - what, rabbit? - to Nestor\u0027s nostrils and making his mouth water. And ... was that a figure hunkered down, as if turning a spit? Some Szgany loner, fixing himself an early breakfast? It was surely so; for the Wamphyri weren\u0027t keen on roasted meat. And they weren\u0027t much for rabbits, either! But didn\u0027t this idiot know there were vampires about, two of them at least; or three, if Nestor included himself?\n He glanced back over his shoulder. The pre-dawn mist was rising, obscuring the trail. No sign of the creatures perched on the hillside now; they were there, of course, but had disappeared utterly in mist and gloom. This fool at his fire was surely unaware of them. But the Wamphyri must return soon. And Nestor had no doubt but that they would be aware of him!\n The man had food; Nestor was hungry; he could warn him, share his breakfast. And no treachery to the Wamphyri, his own kind, in this. He was an outcast after all. And his appearance would fool this loner even as it had fooled Brad Berea. But in any case, best to take precautions.\n Nestor\u0027s crossbow was ready, loaded. Taking care to avoid loose pebbles which might be dislodged, he climbed down boulder to boulder; while below him the fool at the fire coughed where he turned his spit, grunting and grumbling to himself as if he were the only man in the world! Nestor got close, very close, until suddenly the hunched figure fell silent and sniffed the air, looked up and began to turn his head.\n The man would be armed; Nestor didn\u0027t want another bolt in him; he ducked down behind rocks, waited, gradually nerved himself to look out, even to cry out, and so warn the other of his presence. The mist was thickening, and it had a slimy feel to it. Nestor felt his flesh creeping as he looked out between a \u0027V in the rocks.\n The loner was still there, crouched down. But -\n - He was no longer alone!\n Emerging from a dark copse to one side, and flowing like some swift and deadly shadow over the mist-wreathed ground, a second figure approached him. But there could be no mistaking this one - or his intentions. He was Wamphyri, and his mind was full of murder! Even in silhouette and little more than a dark blot, still his face was freakish; a jutting bulge of a head with a stunted, vibrating tentacle extended towards his victim.\n Nestor scarcely required it, but as if to finally prove this creature\u0027s nature it glanced at him - the merest glance - where it sped silent as smoke to its target. Its eyes were red as coals, burning in the hideously misshapen, quivering mask of its face!\n Unable to contain himself - jerking with an involuntary, spastic movement - Nestor stood up, and a pebble was squeezed out from beneath his sandal! The man at the fire heard it clattering in the rocks; he swivelled on his heel, came to his feet in one smoothly flowing movement. But in so doing he turned his back on the thing bearing down upon him!\n Without conscious thought - all instinct - Nestor cried out a warning, aimed his crossbow, discharged the weapon at the vampire. It seemed he knew, again by instinct, where his loyalties lay. He reacted as a Traveller, Szgany, and not the changeling that he thought he was. Or perhaps it wasn\u0027t as complex as that. Maybe it was simply that when the tentacle-faced monster had looked at him with its scarlet eyes, Nestor had known that he was next!\n Almost within striking distance of his intended victim, the vampire Lord was hit in the neck, sent staggering. And as Nestor lost his footing and came sliding over the dome of the last great boulder to crash down on his back, so the would-be \u0027victim\u0027 snatched up a brand and turned towards his attacker. Nestor lay there on his back, winded, gaping at the two. For now in the full firelight he could clearly see his mistake: that both of these creatures were Wamphyri!\n II The Wamphyri Lords Wran (the Rage) Killglance and Vasagi the Suck glared at each other red-eyed across Nestor where he lay on his back, winded. They ignored him; they would not let him distract them from their quarrel, their duel, their mutual hatred. Now that he had shot his bolt he was nothing to them anyway. But from Nestor\u0027s point of view, they were awesome, huge -and hugely malevolent.\n Treacherous bastard!\u0027 Wran snarled at Vasagi, waving his sputtering brand in the other\u0027s hideous face and kicking Nestor out of the way. \u0027So, you thought to come upon me under cover of this fool\u0027s blundering approach, eh? What, and did you think it likely I\u0027d mistake his clatter for your own oily slither?\u0027 (In point of fact he had done just that.)\n Vasagi\u0027s wet, glistening siphon was like the piston shaft of some alien penis; it made an almost sexual, sucking sound as it slid in and out of its sheath in the tip of his defensively mobile trunk or tentacle. He tugged at Nestor\u0027s bolt, which had penetrated the base of his thick, corded neck above his left shoulder and emerged at the back, having missed the spinal column by a hair\u0027s-breadth. He made no answer that Nestor could hear, but Wran the Rage heard it well enough: Killglance, you spotted dog! OnJy good fortune and this Szgany scum together saved you from my single, clean, killing thrust. So now you face my gauntlet -before I ram my probe deep in your spine, to drain your cringing leech.\u0027\n He was more voluble than was his wont; it was bluff and Wran knew it; Vasagi dared not let him see the true colour of his secret thoughts. His wound was not serious: an inconvenience, at worst. But even a bee sting can swing the balance of a fight, and the youth\u0027s bolt was more than a bee sting. Wran knew that the Suck was off balance, so why prolong it?\n Holding the blazing firebrand awkwardly in his left hand, he flicked back his cloak from his right side and so displayed his gauntlet. It glittered red and yellow in the firelight as he flexed his hand within its metal sheath. Vasagi feinted to the left, the right; his movements were quicksilver; even with the ironwood bolt skewering his neck at an angle from side to back, still he was no mean opponent.\n Still sprawling on his back but no longer winded, Nestor attempted to scramble away from the two. But the Suck was moving in the same direction. As Vasagi made a lunge at Wran, his feet got tangled in Nestor\u0027s threshing legs. That was the opening Wran needed. While Vasagi stumbled he moved in, hurled his torch into the Suck\u0027s writhing face and shrinking eyes, grasping his facial anomaly behind the wad of muscle which propelled its siphon. And with Vasagi\u0027s gauntlet tearing his back open to the ribs, Wran aimed a blow at his enemy\u0027s proboscis.\n Wran\u0027s mind telegraphed his grisly intention; Vasagi saw it coming; he had no answer except to scream a desperate mental denial: Nooooo!\n Such was the force of the Suck\u0027s telepathic terror that even Nestor heard it. With Harry Keogh\u0027s blood running in his veins, and with his own share of his brother\u0027s as yet undeveloped mentalist talent, Vasagi\u0027s mind-shriek got through to him and froze him to the marrow. Somehow he lurched upright, but incapable of flight he simply fell back against the outcrop.\n While Vasagi had somehow avoided his enemy\u0027s first blow, still Wran had not relinquished his hold on the Suck\u0027s proboscis. Now the Rage flexed his metal-clad hand in a certain way, and in the moment before he struck a razor spine like the curved frill on a lizard\u0027s back sprang erect from his gauntlet\u0027s knuckles to Wran\u0027s wrist. And Nestor saw the rest of it as a blur of bloody motion.\n Wran\u0027s gauntlet sliced into the Suck\u0027s shuddering snout and cut it half-way through, and with a tearing, sawing, snatching action, Wran quickly completed the job. Then he stepped back a pace to toss the severed trunk and its siphon tip hissing into the fire, and laughed at Vasagi where he staggered to and fro, clawing at his crimson face.\n Despite Wran\u0027s own agony - the fact that the back of his cloak had been torn open, and bloody tatters of meat hung from his gouged ribs - he laughed! \u0027Ah, and what shall they call you now?\u0027 he crowed. \u0027Vasagi the Slobber?\u0027\n Vasagi\u0027s face spurted blood from the sleeve of raw flesh which had housed his probe. His pain was greater than Wran\u0027s, so much so that tears of agony started out of eyes half-blind from the other\u0027s torch-thrust. He held out his gauntlet before him, waving it to and fro like a blind man\u0027s stick. But there was no mercy in Wran the Rage. Still baying with laughter, he moved in and snatched up the blazing brand again. Vasagi turned to flee, stumbled blindly over sharp, jutting rocks, and went down.\n Wran was on him in a flash; he leaped ....ame down massively with both booted feet on Vasagi\u0027s outstretched gauntlet forearm. Bones snapped sickeningly, and even Vasagi managed a gurgling shriek - an actual sound -through the scarlet orifice which was his ruined face.\n Nestor\u0027s mouth was dry as kindling. He glanced here and there in the oh-so-gradually brightening air, looked for his crossbow. It had tumbled with him from on high, gone clattering into the scree. He saw a dull gleam among the rocks and edged towards it, but yet continued to watch the now totally unequal fight.\n Wran kicked at Vasagi\u0027s gauntlet hand until the weapon came loose, then booted it out of reach. Half-blind, siphon-severed, ungauntleted, and his arm flopping loosely, still the Suck tried to stumble to his feet. Every time he almost got up, Wran kicked his feet from under him again. Finally, close to exhaustion, Vasagi flopped and jerked on the ground. Then Wran went to one knee beside him, grasped the ironwood bolt in his neck, and twisted it until the other\u0027s writhing was almost a vibration of sheerest agony.\n Nestor\u0027s trembling hand dragged his crossbow out from a crack in the rocks. He primed it two-handed, undipped the spare bolt from its housing under the tiller. And -\n \u0027Aye, load your weapon,\u0027 Wran\u0027s deep bass voice growled from only four or five swift paces away. \u0027Load it, and bring it here.\u0027 Nestor obeyed the first instruction, but as for the second: he aimed the crossbow at Wran. The other straightened up but kept a booted foot on the writhing Vasagi\u0027s neck. \u0027Well then,\u0027 he said, his scarlet gaze rapt on Nestor, \u0027and what are you waiting for? Shoot me, if you\u0027re sure you can hit my heart. But if you\u0027re not, best do as I say.\u0027\n Nestor found his voice. \u0027You ... are Wamphyri!\u0027\n Wran nodded. \u0027And you\u0027re a fool! But a fool who probably saved my life. Who saved me a deal of trouble, anyway. I owe you for that. But only fire that bolt into me, I\u0027ll owe you a great deal more. And I\u0027ll pay you back bit by bit, until your screams ring out so loud as to bring down the avalanches! Now then, boy. Don\u0027t make me wait but put your bolt in this loathsome thing\u0027s heart.\u0027 He took his foot off the other\u0027s neck and Vasagi sat up.\n Nestor looked at him, and was more frightened of him now than he\u0027d been before ... such a hideous, pitiful sight ... it would be a mercy to kill him. He had only one bolt. He looked at the ugly, broken, bleeding Vasagi, and at Wran. The latter was more the man; he was - what, handsome? Handsomely dressed, anyway. He looked every bit the vampire Lord that Nestor had always pretended, imagined, and now believed himself to be.\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Wran snorted. \u0027No guts for it, eh? But when I give orders, I expect my thralls to jump!\u0027\n Thrall?\u0027 Nestor growled back. \u0027I ... am the Lord Nestor!\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Wran frowned, stepped away from Vasagi, took a pace towards Nestor. \u0027You\u0027re what? A Lord, did you say?\u0027 Behind him, Vasagi took up a jagged rock in his left hand, came flowing to his feet.\n Nestor yelled, \u0027Look out!\u0027 And Wran hunched his shoulders, ducked down, stepped aside. An instant later, Nestor\u0027s bolt was sent thrumming through the air to bury itself to the flight in Vasagi\u0027s already scarlet tunic. Except this time when the Suck was knocked down, he stayed down ...\n The bolt had struck close enough to Vasagi\u0027s heart to paralyse him. With Nestor\u0027s aid, Wran dragged him by the legs, flopping, away from the rocks and up the slope to a place where the hard earth faced squarely south. There he pegged him out face-down, to await the rising sun.\n \u0027Of course, we shall be long gone from here by then,\u0027\n Wran said. \u0027A pity, for I fancy I\u0027d relish the Suck\u0027s screams as the sun reduces him to so much smoulder!\u0027\n \u0027His screams?\u0027 Nestor looked in horror at the pegged-out thing. \u0027But how can he scream?\u0027\n \u0027With his mind,\u0027 Wran explained. And Nestor remembered how he had \u0027heard\u0027 Vasagi\u0027s shriek of denial as Wran went to sever his proboscis.\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 he said.\n Wran turned his scarlet gaze upon him and snorted. \u0027Huh! You don\u0027t know too much for a \"Lord\", do you?\u0027 He grinned, in his way. \u0027And just what sort of a \"Lord\" are you, anyway?\u0027\n \u0027An outcast,\u0027 Nestor lifted his chin. \u0027Cast out of Star-side. And now I\u0027m on my way back.\u0027\n \u0027Really!\u0027 the other nodded, fingered his wen soberly. The lad amused him. \u0027Cast out, you say? For some heinous crime or other, perhaps? Against the Wamphyri?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Nestor shook his head, ran a hand through his hair, felt the plate of new bone where his scalp was thick and rough at the back. \u0027I don\u0027t ... remember.\u0027 Wran looked deep into his dark eyes; they seemed dazed, and the mind behind them not entirely there. Obviously this one had survived some raid or other - barely! But he was well enough now, physically at least.\n \u0027So, you\u0027d be a Lord of the Wamphyri, eh?\u0027 Wran nodded again. An amusing scheme was taking shape in his mind. How it would work out he didn\u0027t know, must wait and see. But as far as Vasagi the Suck was concerned, certainly it would give Wran the last and loudest laugh. \u0027Well, it\u0027s not everyone who gets to be a Lord,\u0027 he said. \u0027But in your case-maybe I can arrange it.\u0027 Then he glanced south and saw the pale stain blossoming on the horizon, and his red eyes narrowed at once. \u0027Except we must do it quickly.\u0027\n \u0027Do what?\u0027 Nestor was innocent as a child. He started as Vasagi made a slobbering sound and blew red bubbles, and began to come awake.\n Wran made no answer but his eyes were totally evil, menacing - inviting? - when he asked: \u0027Are you ... hungry?\u0027 He glanced at Vasagi. \u0027Me, I\u0027m hungry, and this one has a leech in him. If our roles were reversed, he\u0027d do the same to me.\u0027\n Again Nestor felt prompted to ask, Do what? But he kept the question to himself and backed away. For Wran had gone to his knees, and his metamorphic face was less manlike now. His mouth was a gash that opened like a trapdoor, impossibly wide. Teeth grew visibly in that crimson hole, elongating, curving like white daggers from the ruptured ridges of his jaws. They were fangs, with eye teeth like knives; their \u0027blades\u0027 were long as Nestor\u0027s own knife, and overlapped Wran\u0027s trembling lower lip! His nose - dark and squat before, with large black nostrils - grew yet more convoluted, quivering, sensitive as a bat\u0027s. And his eyes seemed almost to drip blood.\n \u0027Aye, leave me now,\u0027 he coughed the words out, shooting Nestor a look that brooked no argument. \u0027But not too far. And when I call out for you, come at once.\u0027 His blunt fingers tore Vasagi\u0027s tunic open, and commenced to knead the ridge of his exposed spine.\n Nestor left him, went stumbling back down to the trail, and along it to the dying embers of Wran\u0027s fire. The roasted meat smell was heavy in the air now. Some wild creature moved there, a fox or feral dog, scurrying at Nestor\u0027s approach. It grabbed up the spit and meat entire from where it lay toppled to one side, dropped the hot food and slunk into the shadows, returned in a moment to snatch up the meat again.\n Nestor had not looked at Wran\u0027s roast before; but now, as it lay there smoking, and as the fox - it was a fox, yes - snapped it up a second time, he saw what it was. At least, he believed he saw what it was. And then he no longer wished to know what it was, except its shape was something his mind couldn\u0027t erase: the blackened form of a tiny Szgany infant! The \u0027bait\u0027 which Wran had used to alert Vasagi to his presence here and lure him to his doom.\n \u0027Nestor, attend me now!\u0027 Wran\u0027s shout drifted down to him through the thinning mist. Nestor looked up, saw how the dawn was advancing. Above the barrier range, the Northstar\u0027s glitter was much reduced. Ah, but as he saw that star of ill-omen the idea returned to burn as brightly as ever, and his horror shrank down. What, fear? Trembling? Trepidation? No, for this was his legacy. He was the Lord Nestor, and he was going home.\n He returned to Wran and saw what he had done, what he was even now about: a nightmarish act or acts! But Nestor\u0027s sensitivities were severely blunted, reduced, even reversed. What would so recently have horrified him merely fascinated him now. These were things which he had somehow forgotten or been caused to forget, which he must now remember, re-learn, if he was to be successful in Starside. Perhaps his failure to appreciate such things in the first place was responsible for his current privations!\n Wran saw his morbid fascination and nodded. \u0027Well, you\u0027re a rare one, I\u0027ll grant you that. I gave you the opportunity to run for it - it\u0027s almost dawn; I have to go; I would not have pursued you - but you\u0027re still here. You really do want to be Wamphyri.\u0027\n Nestor only half heard him, glanced at him, saw that his face and mouth were more nearly \u0027human\u0027 again, however bloody. But mainly he gazed at Vasagi: his back laid open to the naked bone, and something black - his leech? - writhing there, but feebly, like a dying snake of black muscle, half welded to his spine within his body. The black thing had been punctured and leaked crimson, the richest colour Nestor could imagine, whose shade matched precisely the blood on Wran\u0027s face and lips.\n In a voice filled with wonder but little or no fear, finally Nestor asked: \u0027What caused you to fight? For plainly you are both Wamphyri.\u0027\n Wran laughed. \u0027Isn\u0027t that enough reason?\u0027 And then, more soberly: \u0027He insulted me.\u0027 (He shrugged.) \u0027Well, we insulted each other. Our rivalries were various and couldn\u0027t continue. We dwelled too close together and crossed each other\u0027s paths too often. When it came, the challenge was mutual and could only be resolved like this: one of us must die. But even so, we had no desire to entertain our \"brothers\" and our \"sister\" in Starside\u0027s last aerie. And so our duel would be a private thing and take place here, on Sunside. No rules except that we come on our own, with all the length and breadth of Sunside for a battleground, and the long night from sundown to sunup for duration.\u0027\n \u0027What if he had not come to you?\u0027 Nestor\u0027s eyes stayed rapt upon the black thing\u0027s spastic movements where it gradually detached itself from Vasagi\u0027s spine.\n Then there was always tomorrow night,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027But that was unlikely. For to live another night here meant living another day here. Which was the other proviso: that once we set out from Starside, we could not return until it was finished. Aye, and only one of us could go back. Anything else would be seen as - what? - half-hearted at best, cowardice at worst. But we were not cowards, the Suck and I, nor were we half-hearted.\u0027\n That ... thing,\u0027 Nestor nodded towards the maimed, tortured, outstretched form of Vasagi, \u0027is coming out of him.\u0027\n \u0027His leech?\u0027 Wran answered. \u0027Indeed it is! For it knows he is a loser. Perhaps it will have a better chance ... elsewhere?\u0027 Grinning hideously, he cocked his head on one side.\n \u0027Elsewhere?\u0027 Nestor watched the thing\u0027s struggles as it emerged like a long, corrugated slug from Vasagi onto the hard earth. Blind, indeed eyeless, still its \u0027head\u0027 turned in Wran\u0027s direction as it sensed him there. And it lingered like that a moment, swaying this way and that as if it were exhausted and about to collapse. The thing was all of eighteen inches long, ridgy, shiny black and mottled green, and red from the Suck\u0027s spilled blood.\n \u0027A strong new host,\u0027 Wran\u0027s chuckle was a clotted gurgle, \u0027whose precious blood would save its life. Except I can\u0027t allow that, for there\u0027s far too much of Vasagi in it. So ... give me your knife.\u0027\n Nestor handed over the knife, and as he moved so Vasagi\u0027s leech turned towards him. Wran had been appraised; he already had a leech; he\u0027d been rejected as a possible host. But Nestor ... had not. And with slow, painful contractions of its underbelly, it commenced to glide towards him.\n But: \u0027Ah, no, my friend!\u0027 Wran cried. He fell on it, grasped its body with an iron hand, quick as a flash detached its six-inch \u0027head\u0027 and hurled it away, out over the misted trail. There was very little blood left in it to bleed, and very little strength. At first it flexed and whipped like a fish fresh from the river, but then in a moment lay still. Wran stood up from it and grunted: \u0027Now ... watch!\u0027\n Nestor scarcely needed telling; he couldn\u0027t take his eyes off the thing, which had turned a sick, glistening grey. It lay on its back now, more slug-like than ever, its belly silvery in the rapidly improving light. Something like a blister formed in the slit which might be a reproductive organ, and Wran pointed, saying: \u0027Ah, the very thing! Newborn, it knows nothing. In its way, why, it\u0027s much like yourself, Nestor! Aye, Vasagi\u0027s egg is all instinct. See!\u0027\n The blister was now a small grey sphere no larger than a man\u0027s thumbnail, which detached itself from the parent body and slid down the thing\u0027s belly to the earth. Nestor saw that there was something mobile within it. He had watched tadpoles emerging from frog-spawn when he was a child; it was like that, but the casing of the egg was more like a film than a jelly. Suddenly it popped like a bubble, releasing its contents. The small, silvery sphere which emerged was frantic; covered with hundreds of flickering hairs, it skittered to and fro among the pebbles.\n Wran said: \u0027Can you believe it? Can you understand, Nestor? For this tiny, harmless thing ... is what you would be! It is Wamphyri!\u0027 He went to one knee again, reached out his hand to touch it - and the sphere ran along his finger on to his palm and spun there like a top. He held it out so that Nestor could see it more clearly: this whirling thing in his palm - which suddenly grew motionless! And:\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Wran said. \u0027It would test me. Watch closely.\u0027\n Nestor moved closer, gaped; his eyes were wide and his jaw hung open. The egg put out a single red thorn which sank effortlessly into the horny flesh of Wran\u0027s hand. And it tested - it tasted - him! Then ... the stinger was withdrawn in a moment, and the egg commenced spinning again.\n \u0027Ah, shame!\u0027 Wran cried. \u0027It rejects me! Only enter my body ... it would be devoured in a moment, and knows it. But your body is an entirely different thing!\u0027 Wran stopped smiling; his eyes were suddenly huge, blazing with hell\u0027s fires; he blew the vampire egg off the palm of his hand like blowing a kiss - directly into Nestor\u0027s face!\n Nestor closed his mouth, turned his face aside as the stench of Wran\u0027s breath hit him. But the egg hit him at one and the same time, and clung like spittle to his cheek - for a single moment. Then he felt it mobile on his flesh, inside his shirt, moving to the back of his neck. And Wran was right: from then on it was all instinct. Instinct told him to crush this thing, remove it, kill it, before he in turn was tested, tasted. Too late, for in his case that wasn\u0027t necessary. The egg had instincts, too, and knew that Nestor was innocent.\n In position, the shimmering pearly sphere turned scarlet. Requiring no ovipositor, it soaked into him, was absorbed into Nestor\u0027s flesh like water into sand. Settling to his spine, it made contact and fused with his shrinking nerve cells. Until which time, Nestor had never really known what pain was. But now he knew.\n He started, cried out, leaped, gave a reflex bound into the air with his limbs flying in all directions. He came down on his back among sharp stones and didn\u0027t even feel them, but he felt the thing exploring his spine. He jumped up, bounded again, as if to shake it loose. And the pain, which was now spreading through every part of his body - back, skull, all of his limbs - increased. There was a fire in his veins, which burned worse than vinegar in an open wound.\n He tripped, fell, rolled among rocks which cut him, and felt nothing of it. For his cuts were like scratches compared to a lashing whip, except there were a hundred whips and they were all lashing inside him.\n Through all of this Wran the Rage laughed like a madman - a mad thing - laughed, danced and held his sides, and finally sat down, rocking this way and that in hellish glee. He laughed until tears streamed from his red eyes, ran down his grey cheeks to drip from the wen on his chin; laughed till he leaned back against a rock and the raw flesh of his back was rubbed. And at that ... perhaps at last he appreciated something of Nestor\u0027s pain, too.\n Nestor had passed through panic and desperation and was well on his way into hell. He thought he was dying, that his agonies must soon kill him, but not soon enough, and knew he would welcome Death as a friend, a merciful release. His skull was bursting; his spine was on fire; acid coursed in his veins where he rolled and writhed upon the ground. But as Wran approached him, he summoned strength from somewhere and jerked to his knees, and begged him, \u0027P-p-please!\u0027\n \u0027Aye, enough,\u0027 Wran nodded, and hit him just once...\n \u0027Wake up!\u0027 A hand hard as old leather slapped Nestor\u0027s face, rocking his head to and fro. He sat propped against a boulder, exhausted, with the agony of his internal conflict gone now but all of his new cuts and bruises burning and throbbing. Opening his eyes, he saw Wran of the Wamphyri standing huge against the dawn. Dawn, yes, for the vampire Lord was a silhouette with Sunside for a backdrop; while beyond him on the rim of the world, a fan of golden spokes was already probing the sky.\n \u0027I go now,\u0027 Wran grunted. \u0027Up there on the bluff,\u0027 he jerked his head, \u0027two flyers are waiting. One of them was Vasagi\u0027s. As you\u0027re aware, he no longer has need of it. You have his egg, so why not his flyer too, eh?\n Earlier, as you approached me in the night, my ears followed you along every inch of your route. Unless you were blind you saw the beasts. Am I right?\u0027\n Nestor nodded, which was as much as he could do.\n \u0027Well then, my Lord Nestor, the rest is up to you,\u0027 Wran told him. \u0027If you would come to Starside, the way stands open. Command Vasagi\u0027s beast and fly it home. Or if you\u0027re too weak, then it\u0027s best you stay here. Except I would warn you, the egg is sensitive: when it feels the sun upon your flesh its frenzy may well kill you. So fly or die, it\u0027s simple as that.\u0027\n Again Nestor nodded. But his eyes were less vacant now; indeed they were unwavering, hard, fixed upon Wran\u0027s face as if to remember every last line and pore of it. The night is flown,\u0027 Wran said. \u0027An hour at most before a golden blister bursts on the world\u0027s rim, and splashes these barrier mountains with yellow pus. But in Starside, all is safe and dark.\u0027\n He turned and strode away, and could feel Nestor\u0027s eyes burning on his back as he climbed the rugged slope towards his flyer ...\n Nestor couldn\u0027t walk, so he crawled on hands and knees. But as he passed the pegged-out form of Vasagi, something spoke in his head: Boy, loosen these pegs.\n It was a whisper, faint, tortured, pitiful. As yet, Nestor could still pity. He looked at Vasagi where he lay: his bloody, mutilated face blowing scarlet froth into the dust; his broken arm and ravaged spine; a bolt projecting from his back, and his neck a gaping mess where the first bolt had been wrenched free and tossed aside. Yet still alive!\n Aye, but dying, the voice came again. Wran hurt me sorely, but it was you who brought me down. So perhaps you\u0027re worthy to be Wamphyri at that. But you have my egg, my flyer . .. must you take my life, too? It is finished anyway - but not like this, I beg you. Pull out the pegs, and let me crawl away into some cave to die. But not in the sunlight, for you can\u0027t know what it is ... for one like me ... to die in sunlight...\n Nestor knew well enough. Hadn\u0027t his flyer gone the same way, melting into stench and evaporation? But to pull out the pegs ... what if this creature were still dangerous?\n The laughter which swelled in his mind then was bitter, and filled with a painful irony. Dangerous? Oh, I was, it\u0027s true! But now? I have no leech; I am broken, gutted, an empty shell. But you ... you are, or you were, Szgany. And you have things in you other than the morbid emotions of the Wamphyri. For a little while longer, at least. Which is why I beg you one last time; pull out the pegs.\n Nestor did it, and crawled on. In a little while he could get to his feet. He looked back, and Vasagi was still stretched there; he hadn\u0027t moved; perhaps he couldn\u0027t. Nestor put him out of his mind and went to his flyer.\n The beast saw him coming and looked at him through stupid, lustreless eyes. He approached it carefully, for he saw how it could roll or flop on him and crush his life out. But it was of vampire stuff and sensed the vampire in Nestor; it blinked its great eyes nervously as he took hold of its trappings, no more than that. Then, as he dragged himself up into the saddle, he saw Vasagi\u0027s bloody gauntlet hanging from a strap, where Wran had left it for him. Of course, for what\u0027s a Lord of the Wamphyri without his gauntlet?\n Sunside was all hazy grey and green now, with mists rising out of the dark forests and blue smoke from distant campsites and townships, and all the birds waking up, commencing their dawn chorus. Central on the southern horizon, a yellow glow threatened at any moment to become a golden furnace.\n Nestor dug his heels into his mount\u0027s sides at the base of its swaying neck, and gave a tentative jerk on the reins. \u0027Up,\u0027 he grunted. \u0027Let\u0027s be away.\u0027\n The creature craned its neck, looked at him curiously, stretched its manta wings - and did nothing. Nestor slapped its neck and the grey flesh twitched a little - that was all. \u0027Up!\u0027 he shouted, digging harder with his heels where rasps on Vasagi\u0027s boots had furrowed the beast\u0027s flanks. It grunted and quivered, but sat still. The answer was in Nestor\u0027s head, and finally he found it there.\n I want you to fly! he told the creature. Up, now, into the sky, and home to Starside. Or would you rather melt when the sun comes up? Metamorphic muscles bunched then, and the flyer\u0027s thrusters coiled themselves as tight as springs. But still the beast would not, could not obey him. Till suddenly Vasagi\u0027s almost exhausted \u0027voice\u0027 joined Nestor\u0027s: Aye, you were ever a faithful beast. When I told you to stay, you stayed. But now you are his. It pleases me to give you to him . .. for a while, at least. So fly - fly!\n The beast\u0027s wings extended from its sides as alveolate bones, membrane and muscle stretched and flowed in metamorphic flux. A moment more and it tilted forward on the rim of the bluff. Nestor clung with his knees, gripped hard on the reins. The flyer\u0027s thrusters uncoiled to hurl it aloft and forward ... it flew!\n Wind whipped in Nestor\u0027s face as his weird mount glided out over Sunside, gaining height. But Sunside wasn\u0027t the way to go. And: \u0027Starside!\u0027 he shouted, with mind and mouth both. \u0027Starside!\u0027 Until the flyer arched its manta wings into vast scoops or air-traps, turned in a rising thermal, and climbed for the peaks.\n And down in the misted valleys and forests, everything Nestor had been and done - everything which he\u0027d known and had now forgotten, forsaken - was left far, far behind ...\n Nathan followed the course of the Great Dark River, visiting Crack-in-the-Rocks, Many-Caverns, the twin colonies Lake-of-Light and Lake-of-Stars, and Place-of-the-Beast-Bones. Mostly he travelled the river route, deep under the desert; on occasion, where the river became a borehole with no path as such, he must be ferried through black bowels of earth; sometimes he went on the surface, from oasis to oasis, where wells or potholes connected the drifted sands to the subterranean silt of the river.\n There were many Thyre colonies, though few of them accommodated more than a hundred or so individuals. Even Open-to-the-Sky, which was the largest so far visited, had only supported some two hundred and sixty inhabitants. According to Atwei, the total count of Thyre did not exceed five thousand. To expand in excess of that number would be to reduce their living standards in the limited space available.\n Nathan passed on lore and learning wherever he went, firmly establishing himself as a friend of the Thyre, never once forgetting the humility which the desert folk - and their dead - so admired in him. And in the process of teaching, Nathan learned.\n He came across others who said they \u0027knew\u0027 numbers, but no one whose understanding surpassed Ethloi the Elder\u0027s rudimentary grasp. He studied what Ethloi had shown him, worked with his \u0027Tens System\u0027 and explored division, multiplication, even decimals; all without knowing his purpose or even if he had one beyond that he had been told it was important to him. And sometimes he conjured the numbers vortex, trapping whole sections of its fluxing configurations and bringing them to immobility on the screen of his mind, so that he might examine them. They revealed nothing but remained as alien as the farthest stars. Only relax his concentration for a moment ... they would flow, mutate, rejoin the vortex and be sucked back into an infinity of fathomless formulae ...\n The Thyre gave him news of the Wamphyri. Here, far to the east of the great pass into Starside, their works were less in evidence. What Nathan was able to learn fitted well with what he already knew: that only a handful had crossed the Great Red Waste into Starside, and that they had settled in Karenstack, the last aerie. There they consolidated their position, built their army, created vampires. Since all of the \u0027makings\u0027 could be found just across the mountains, an hour\u0027s flight away, as yet they\u0027d felt no need to strike east; for the moment it satisfied them merely to scout on the eastern territories; coming in the dead of night, they\u0027d been seen as shadows against the moon and stars, mapping out the land from on high, and gazing down rapaciously on the human wealth of tomorrow\u0027s conquests.\n West of the pass, however - among the displaced and dispossessed, ensieged and embattled people of Settlement, Tireni Scarp, Mirlu Township, a half-dozen more towns and encampments, and all of the Szgany tribes which now wandered there - things were different. For there could be found the first real victims of the scarlet plague, but only the first. For just as soon as the Wamphyri had recruited sufficient thralls and lieutenants, made enough of flyers and warriors, and established themselves as an utterly incontestable conquering force, then it would be time to advance their borders east. The rape of Sunside would continue, expand, and finally engulf all. The old order would fall, and the Szgany ... would be as cattle ...\n En route east, Nathan spent less time in each new Thyre colony; he felt himself drawn east, to the very roots of the cancer which was even now spreading through Sunside. Perhaps that was the main attraction: no longer satisfied to run from the plague, he had determined to meet it head on. For unless he was prepared to spend the rest of his life with the Thyre, eventually it must overtake him anyway. Why, given time, it might even overrun the Thyre themselves! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-23.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \n The vampires have been vanquished!
