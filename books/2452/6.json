{"id":80273,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\u0027A plague, I said,\u0027 Turgo reminded him, \u0027and a plague\u0027s what I meant. For in the dead of the next night - and after that poor lass\u0027s husband had buried her in the woods - who should come ghosting into camp but the girl herself! Oh, her flesh was pale and her nails broken from the digging, but her appetite was healthy enough, and good long teeth to match it! \u0027Well, the men around the fire had all taken strong drink; at first they didn\u0027t know her. She went among them like a whore, tempting, stroking, biting their necks. But suddenly her bites were real! Aye, and her eyes were red! Then, they knew her. \u0027Well, this time we knew better what we were doing. But we had to hold her poor raving husband down while we did it...\" Heinar shook his head in utter bewilderment. Until at last: \u0027A plague, aye,\u0027 he said. \u0027But Turgo, what are we talking about here? A creature that lives in a man - or a woman - making him or her crazy enough to live by the blood of other men?\u0027 That\u0027s exactly what we\u0027re talking about,\u0027 said the other. \u0027A wampir which makes its host victim strong, lusty, devious, and very hard to kill. Old Oulio lonescu wasn\u0027t a rapist, and he certainly wasn\u0027t a murderer! And what about this girl, who came back from the grave?\u0027 \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" \u0027Isn\u0027t it possible she was buried alive?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Turgo shook his head in firm denial. \u0027She was dead for sure. And later - undead!\u0027 Heinar could scarcely take it all in. \u0027What was that word you used? Wampir?\u0027 Turgo nodded. \u0027In certain western regions, that\u0027s what men call the great bats that suck on goats. If they find a crippled goat under the moon, they\u0027ll suck him dry.\u0027 Heinar\u0027s mouth was likewise dry. He looked nervously all about - at the tents, the carts and caravans, and not least the shadows - then licked his lips and finally nodded. \u0027Well, I know about such bats, of course: we Hagis call \u0027em \"vexies\". Catch them at our goats, we sneak up, club them, break their wings. But men with giant leeches in them?\u0027 He didn\u0027t try to hide a small shudder. \u0027No, I have to admit, you\u0027re the expert on this one, Turgo Zolte. So what next? How do we handle it?\u0027 \u0027What we don\u0027t do is act too hasty,\u0027 Turgo said. \u0027For we\u0027d never live it down if this Shaitan\u0027s innocent - and a hero to boot.\u0027 \u0027Which he could well be,\u0027 Heinar let himself down from his branch. \u0027For after all, young Vidra Gogosita reckons he saved his life!\u0027 Turgo\u0027s deep-etched frown showed his dilemma, his uncertainty. \u0027That\u0027s the hell of it,\u0027 he nodded. \u0027It\u0027s possible all this talk\u0027s for nothing - indeed I hope it is! - but can we risk it?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 Heinar gave a short, sharp shake of his head, convinced that he\u0027d be far better safe than sorry. \u0027Vidra\u0027s had his head down for a while now. Perhaps we should go and have a word with him.\u0027 They did. The widow Gogosita heard them coming, met them at the flap of her tent with a finger to her lips. \u0027Shhh! The poor lad\u0027s asleep. And Heinar,\u0027 she grasped his arm, \u0027it\u0027s very good of you to show your concern this way. Ah, but it must have been terrible up there! Such nightmares! Vidra rambles as in a fever ... he speaks of blood, and murder!\u0027 They went in, all three, to stand quietly beside the youth where he tossed and turned. The night had turned cold, and yet the sweat stood out on Vidra\u0027s brow. He was pale as a ghost, with grey hollows in his cheeks and under his eyes. Turgo glanced at Heinar, went to shake the lad\u0027s shoulder. His mother got between. \u0027What\u0027s this?\u0027 she hissed. \u0027But can\u0027t you see he needs his sleep? Well, whatever, it will have to keep.\u0027 \u0027No, Elana. It can\u0027t keep.\u0027 Heinar was familiar with her, but firm. He put her to one side, and ... ... And Vidra came breathlessly, babblingly alive! He was still asleep, but the cold sweat welled up that much faster, and the words jerked out of him in squalls, like sudden bursts of spattering rain. \u0027No, no ... keep off ... keep away!\u0027 He tugged at his blanket until it was a damp knot. \u0027Ah, great ghoul ... but do you murder men for their clothes? No, no, for I see it\u0027s more than their clothes you\u0027re after! ... Keep off! Go torment Dezmir ... not me, not me.\u0027 He flopped this way and that. \u0027Ah, but now I know you, fiend! ... Your eyes like lamps ... they let you find your way in the dark! But not me, not me! Go suck on Dezmir\u0027s neck and let me be!\u0027 And with that last he turned on his side, and his neck was visible where his mother had washed it. Turgo and Heinar looked - and saw. \u0027Punctures,\u0027 Turgo growled. \u0027Tears in the flesh. And the flesh itself inflamed, poisoned!\u0027 Heinar nodded his grim agreement. The widow\u0027s hand had flown to her mouth. \u0027What did Vidra say? About murdering men for ... for their clothes? But now it comes to me. That stranger was wearing Vidra\u0027s long coat. Also Klaus Luncani\u0027s trousers! Much too short for him ... they have a patched right thigh. I\u0027d know that patch anywhere, for I put it there. His poor wife is no good ... with needle and thread ... at all!\u0027 Her eyes opened like great mad windows. And so did Vidra\u0027s as he came awake, sat bolt upright and snarled his terror, then reached out his trembling arms for his mother. \u0027Ma! - Mama! - Ma-aaaaa!\u0027 His cry was a gasp, a hiss, not loud, but it penetrated Turgo, Heinar and the widow like a long hot iron sliding into their flesh. And for all that it was quiet, still its echoes reached out a great deal farther than the tent of the Gogositas ... In Maria Babeni\u0027s caravan, Shaitan came awake! What was that? A cry in the night? From which quarter? The night seemed still, quiet, but Shaitan\u0027s vampire intelligence was not. It was unquiet. He sensed movement; men other than the watchkeepers were awake in the camp, stirring furtively. ... And they were with his thrall! He reached out with his mind - and gasped as the scene in the tent of the widow Gogosita flooded his awareness in all its vivid, telepathic detail. Not a scene from the youth\u0027s dreams, no, but from life. Vidra was awake - and talking his head off! No! Shaitan sent his command like a flung knife. Oh, you faithless one! Much too Idle now to change sides, Vidra Gogosita ... In the widow\u0027s tent, suddenly Vidra\u0027s terrified eyes went wide where he clasped his mother and babbled the true story to Turgo and Heinar. His words were shut off as Shaitan closed a telepathic fist on his mind; groaning, he slumped to the floor. But the others had heard enough. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" \u0027Look after him!\u0027 Heinar snapped as the frantic widow got down beside her son. And Turgo thought: Aye, look after him very, very well! Then the two men were out of the tent, and Heinar blowing on his alert whistle. From out on the perimeter came answering cries, the strange cough of a wolf, sounds of men hurrying to investigate. The girl\u0027s caravan is on the other side of the clearing,\u0027 Heinar grunted, leading the way. They skirted the campfire, and Heinar blew again. \u0027He\u0027ll be alerted by now,\u0027 Turgo warned. \u0027Distracted, I hope!\u0027 Heinar answered. Turgo loaded his small crossbow, knocked off the safety. \u0027There are only the two of us.\u0027 \u0027Huh! How many do we need?\u0027 Turgo wasn\u0027t known for his patience. Baring his teeth, he snarled, \u0027More than just the two of us, be sure!\u0027 And he grabbed Heinar\u0027s arm to slow him down. By then they had almost reached Maria Babeni\u0027s small caravan. Heinar shook himself free of the other\u0027s hand, growled, \u0027Yes, I know: he\u0027ll be strong, this creature. But poor Maria, she\u0027s just a weak girl - and me, I\u0027m Szgany!\u0027 \u0027Both of us,\u0027 Turgo snapped. \u0027Both fools, too.\u0027 Arriving at the small covered cart, Heinar blew one last blast on his whistle; a glimmer of lamplight shining through the wicker weave of the caravan\u0027s door went out at once; the shadows lengthened as watchmen came loping in starlight. But before they could arrive, the door was flung open! Shaitan stood there, his face a pallid mask, alert but calm. And no disguising the scarlet fire in his eyes now. He made no attempt to do so but said, simply, \u0027Heinar, my ways will be strange to you at first. But only follow them, and I shall make you the most powerful leader the Szgany ever knew, until the Hagis are feared throughout the length and breadth of Sunside.\u0027 Heinar shook his head. \u0027It wasn\u0027t fear made me a leader,\u0027 he answered, \u0027but respect. That ... and justice!\u0027 And to the man beside him, in a voice which cracked like a whip to activate his trigger finger: Turgo!\u0027 Turgo\u0027s bolt zipped from the tiller of his weapon. But in the same moment, Shaitan snarled and slammed the door in their faces. Still the heavy hardwood bolt struck through the wickerwork to find its target; most certainly, for Shaitan\u0027s cry of pain sounded from within like the howl of a stricken animal, and the flights of the bolt were sheared from its shaft as it was wrenched through the tough weave and out of sight. Men arrived on the scene: three of them, one with his wolf to heel. \u0027What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s happening?\u0027 Heinar had no time for explanations. \u0027That man in there, the stranger Shaitan. I want him brought down. Maybe even dead. Turgo here has shot him; that might be enough ...\u0027 Turgo, fitting another bolt to his crossbow, thought not. And he was right. But before he could say anything: A mist sprang up; it sprang into being, literally! One moment, the five men stood at the door of Maria\u0027s small caravan - with lamps in the other tents and carts beginning to flicker into life at the commotion, and grumbling voices raised in inquiry - and the air was dry and sharp. Then, suddenly, as if the earth and the forest had exhaled mightily, a ground mist lapped at their ankles, and the air was damp, even greasy. Time only for one of the watchmen to murmur, \u0027What?\u0027 - and another, \u0027Eh?\u0027 - before the mist was thickening, writhing in the trees, obscuring the camp\u0027s silhouettes. Then, from the covered cart, Maria Babeni\u0027s cry rang out! Galvanized, forgetting for the moment the weirdness of the night, Heinar bounded forward up the single wooden step, charging the door with his shoulder. Simultaneously, there came the sound of ripped leather and the cart rocked a little. The door burst inwards under Heinar\u0027s weight and a wall of mist greeted him, collapsing around him, issuing outwards from the caravan like water when the dam breaks. Then the Hagi was inside, with Turgo hot on his heels; and Maria, naked and sobbing, collapsing into their arms. A hole gaped in a side wall. Framed in the ripped hide, briefly, they saw the tall pale figure of Shaitan before he fled outwards to the night. Turgo\u0027s bolt was in his shoulder, blood flowing freely ....ut not only blood. For when Shaitan breathed, he breathed a billowing mist. And the pores of his body, open like tiny pouting mouths, secreted milky vapour as a slug issues slime! Turgo cursed, fought free of Maria\u0027s arms, loosed his second bolt through the hole into Shaitan\u0027s mist, hopefully into Shaitan. But no, there came no answering cry, only a red-eyed shadow loping soundlessly through the mist-damp shrubbery. \u0027Loose your wolf!\u0027 Heinar shouted to the men outside. With a snarl, the animal went bounding, and the watchmen after it. \u0027Yes, get after him!\u0027 Turgo leaned out of the door, urging them on. \u0027And don\u0027t just catch him -kill him on the spot!\u0027 If you can ... Heinar had wrapped his coat around the girl. They laid her on her bed, examined her neck. Nothing, just bruises, and more on her body. They were proper about it: they merely glanced at her naked flesh, but that was enough. There were signs which both men knew. And confirming their unspoken thoughts: \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" \u0027I ... had thought I was dreaming,\u0027 her voice was tiny, a sob. \u0027But ... when I woke up, I ... I knew what he had done. Except I ... I couldn\u0027t stop him! I swear it! He ... he has this power. It\u0027s in his eyes ...\u0027 Heinar called for women, left Maria in their care. And a little while later, at the campfire: \u0027Well?\u0027 he asked Turgo. \u0027And what now?\u0027 The mist had thinned out, seeped into the ground, disappeared. The stars were bright again and the hurtling moon just risen. From away in the forest came far, faint shouting. \u0027For now,\u0027 Turgo answered, as the distant cries died away, \u0027let\u0027s just wait and see if they get him.\u0027 Heinar grunted, nodded, said, \u0027Well, Turgo Zolte, it seems the Szgany Hagi are firmly in your debt. And me, I\u0027ll not forget it. Hah.\u0027 Who could forget a night like this? But at least young Vidra and the girl are all right.\u0027 The other made no answer, merely stared into the fire and wondered, Ail right, are they? Are they really? Before the dawn two of the three men returned. They had got cut off from the third watchkeeper and hadn\u0027t seen him since. Neither him nor his wolf. At sunup Heinar found Turgo packing his small tent and a very few personal things, and sniffing out the breeze from the east. \u0027Something on your mind?\u0027 he inquired. \u0027I came to you with nothing,\u0027 Turgo answered, \u0027and I\u0027m not taking much more away with me. What little I have, I\u0027ve earned. Any complaints?\u0027 \u0027None. But I don\u0027t like to see you go. Has last night upset you? Is it the girl? What happened wasn\u0027t her fault; this Shaitan was full of arts; she would still make a good wife ... for someone.\u0027 \u0027Not this someone,\u0027 Turgo shook his head. Then, galvanized, he hugged the other, and said, \u0027Heinar, listen ... be careful!\u0027 Astonished, the Hagi freed himself. \u0027I always am careful,\u0027 he answered. \u0027But of what this time?\u0027 Turgo shrugged, looked away. \u0027Something of innocence has gone,\u0027 he said, finally. \u0027In its place, something full of dark knowledge, power, evil, has come. Like the Szgany Ferenc before them, the Szgany Hagi are touched by it.\u0027 Grey-faced, he turned to Heinar and grasped his shoulders. \u0027Listen: I can\u0027t watch it happen again, not to you and yours, and stand there powerless to stop it! It came from the west, and so I\u0027m heading east.\u0027 Frowning, Heinar inquired, \u0027And if this evil lingers on, how should I guard against it?\u0027 \u0027Chiefly with your eyes. And whenever you see it, put it down! One of your men hasn\u0027t returned. If he does, watch him - and his wolf! Watch the ones who did return, likewise Maria Babeni. Most obvious of all, watch Vidra Gogosita.\u0027 \u0027Vidra? His mother\u0027s in a state. He wandered off in the night, apparently. His fever ...\u0027 \u0027Oh?\u0027 Turgo hardly seemed surprised. \u0027Then say a prayer that he never comes back. Aye, and you\u0027d do well to watch his mother, too.\u0027 He put his pack on his shoulder, headed off. Heinar felt the sun warm on his weatherbeaten face and was seduced by a feeling of well-being. He called after Turgo: \u0027I think you exaggerate! Whatever evil came with this Shaitan, whatever sickness he carried, it\u0027s disappeared with him. Also, and wherever he is, it\u0027s bound to kill him in the end. There\u0027s nothing here now to run away from.\u0027 \u0027Running?\u0027 Turgo called back over his shoulder, dappled by sunlight where he strode among the trees. \u0027Yes, I suppose I am. It\u0027s the only way I know to put distance between.\u0027 When he paused to look back, his lips were tight and grim. Then: \u0027In certain ways we\u0027re alike, you and I, Heinar,\u0027 he said. \u0027And do you make camp beside a poisoned pool? No, for you know better than that. Well, and so do I know better. For I\u0027ve seen this thing before and know that I can\u0027t live with it. Now let me warn you one last time, and I pray you\u0027ll heed these final words of mine: keep watch, Heinar - keep watch!\u0027 But the sun still felt very warm and reassuring to Heinar. He would keep watch, of course - well, for a while. \u0027Eat well, then,\u0027 he called out after Turgo, perhaps a little too gruffly. \u0027Stay healthy. Have many children ... eventually.\u0027 Turgo\u0027s nod was his only answer. And then he was gone... Turgo Zolte was right: it would take Heinar Hagi eight long years to eradicate Shaitan\u0027s vampire taint from his people, a task which in the end would amount to culling the tribe down to less than half its current numbers. It was to be man\u0027s first real stand against vampires (if not the Wamphyri proper), out of which would be learned many a valuable lesson for the future. Of the Szgany Ferenc who had featured in Turgo\u0027s tale of Oulio lonescu: the taint in their blood never would be washed away but would stay with them to the end of their days, not only in this world but also in one other. That, however, is a tale already told ... Ill Raging, Shaitan fled from the camp of Heinar Hagi. He flowed through the night, which was his element, and covered himself with its darkness; but behind him a watchdog - indeed a wolf - came fast on his heels. And behind the wolf came Sunsiders, Szgany, which he had discovered were in no way trogs. Difficult to impose one\u0027s will on such as these. Their own will was so very strong! Shaitan would have more sway over their women, who at least appreciated his beauty. But to remain beautiful, indeed, to remain alive ... this was now his chief priority. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Turgo Zolte\u0027s bloodied hardwood bolt stood out from his right shoulder, giving him pain. He might will something of the pain away, but not the bolt itself. That would have to be drawn out. And despite the speed of his flowing flight along the forest\u0027s fringe, the wolf was gaining. Its eyes were very nearly the equivalent of Shaitan\u0027s own in the night and the darkness. Cliffs reared suddenly on Shaitan\u0027s left hand; he lengthened his stride, flowed through the uneven foliage, climbed up onto a low ledge. Vines and creepers hung down from above. But it was not his intention to climb. He jammed the flight end of the bolt in his shoulder into a niche, wrenched his body sharply to one side. The bolt snapped ... and Shaitan cried out! Blood flowed freely, its smell inflaming him. Now he felt behind his shoulder with his left hand. The barb of the iron arrowhead protruded an inch, but he had no leverage to pull it out. He tore down a length of tough vine, looped it over the arrowhead, tied its ends to a creeper growing from a crevice. The wolf had heard Shaitan\u0027s cry, smelled his blood. It came snarling, leaping to attain the ledge, scrabbled there a moment to regain its balance. Then it saw Shaitan and leaped again, locking its jaws on his arm. Its weight overbalanced him; locked together they fell from the ledge; the bolt was torn from Shaitan\u0027s back. In the near-distance, Shaitan\u0027s closest human pursuer called out to his wolf: \u0027Seek him!\u0027 But the wolf had already discovered Shaitan, who was himself on the point of discovering a new and terrible weapon. Within him, his vampire was at last mature. Metamorphic, its flesh was Shaitan\u0027s flesh. The wolf had jaws like a bear-trap, clamped fast now to the bones of Shaitan\u0027s forearm. Their eyes met, feral yellow against evil scarlet, and the man felt something of the beast\u0027s ferocity. So did his vampire, which must make him ferocious to match. Something was summoned to his flesh, summoned from his flesh! He felt a burning in his fingers as if they were on fire, an agony in his face and jaws far greater than the mere pain in his back. And yet these additional pains were not without ... pleasure? It was not unlike those occasions when he had summoned his vampire mist; but he had not summoned this, not knowingly. For this was the instinctive response of his metamorphism, the tenacity of his vampire, its lust for life; and suddenly the great wolf was no more than a puppy! Shaitan\u0027s fingers, grown to claws, rammed into the animal\u0027s sides and tore them; his jaws, yawning impossibly wide, elongated into a nightmare cavern of serrated tusks which sprouted from red-gushing gums; his eyes were blobs of sulphur shot with scarlet fire. Gutting the wolf, he let its entrails spill. And when its agonized jaws flew open, then Shaitan\u0027s closed - upon its throat. Which he tore out in a welter of pipes and gristle and gore! In just a moment, the wolf was wolf no more but a mangled carcass; it hadn\u0027t even cried out but died silently, in vast astonishment... A second passed ... another ... and a third. \u0027Lupe?\u0027 A voice called from close at hand. \u0027Where in all that\u0027s ...?\u0027 A man stepped out of the trees into starlight - in time to see something move in the undergrowth at the foot of the cliffs. \u0027Lupe?\u0027 the man repeated, but in a whisper now, wonderingly, as he lifted his crossbow. Crouching down a little, he ran to the place beneath the cliffs. As he got there, so the darkness came flowing to its feet! Starlight gleamed on the horror that was Shaitan, which reached out a bloody hand and caught the other by his throat. The watchman would have discharged his weapon -but he\u0027d left the safety on! Shaitan knocked it from his trembling hand and drew him closer. And: \u0027Lupe?\u0027 he quietly, almost conversationally growled, his monstrous head cocked on one side. \u0027Ah, no - for my name is Shaitan!\u0027 And as he lowered his face to the other\u0027s throbbing neck, \u0027But from this time forward you must call me master ...\u0027 With his new disciple or lieutenant, who was the first entirely human underling of the Wamphyri, Shaitan headed east as before. There were no more pursuers; the night was long; they covered a good many miles - before the sun found them out. For Shaitan\u0027s symbiont or parasite was a two-edged sword: one could not accept its advantages without its disadvantages. Sunlight, which had irritated Shaitan from the outset - almost from the moment of his breathing the red, corpse-spawned spores - now became a seething agony in his eyes and against his hide. It burned him, visibly steamed the moisture from his flesh, ate into him like acid and sapped his strength. He could stand to go out from the shade for seconds, but minutes would deplete him horribly, and an hour would kill him. His thrall was less susceptible for the moment; given time, however, and he, too, must surely succumb to direct sunlight. Such was the measure of Shaitan\u0027s corruption, and his contagion. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" They were climbing diagonally eastward, above the foothills and towards the tree-line, when sunup came with its fogs in Sunside\u0027s valleys and forests, and its probing golden beams on the peaks; beams which gradually joined up to become a wall of yellow fire, creeping down towards them where they went all unsuspecting, like ants on the flank of the mountain. And yet perhaps Shaitan (or his leech) did suspect something; for there was an anxiety in him, not yet fathomed, to be out of this place and once more into the cool of Starside. But when he felt the effect of the first of those as yet hazy beams on his nakedness, and when he observed in astonishment the rapid evaporation of his body\u0027s fluids and the scorching of his flesh, then he understood well enough his instinct - or that of his vampire - to take cover. And so, forced into the shade of a deep cave, Shaitan and his thrall, Ilya Sul, waited out the long day. The cave had been the lair of some creature but now was empty; lesser caves and branching fissures within were cool, damp, dark; Shaitan felt reasonably secure. But he also felt hungry. The sun\u0027s rays, in however brief a time, had depleted him sorely. He fuelled himself on Ilya Sul, which weakened the man more yet but bound him even closer to his master. Also, it fed the vampire fire in Sul\u0027s blood, and hastened his change. So that when he went out on to the slopes with his crossbow, to find food for himself, he returned within the hour, feeble and blistered by the sun. But at least he\u0027d shot a kid, which Shaitan gorged upon before tossing the less appealing parts to Sul. So they fed themselves. And then they slept, because by now they could feel the weight of the risen sun, like an immovable boulder, blocking the door of the cave; which meant there was no going on for a while. And Shaitan could hear the land outside sizzling with a deadly heat; he could even smell the scorching of the rocks, so that his skin crept with the knowledge of what that golden furnace could do to him ... Shaitan came starting awake! He shook Sul, cautioned him to silence. The sun is high,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I can feel it. Also, I feel Sunsiders! So come, find a dark hole for yourself.\u0027 They retreated into the cave deeper still, found shadowed niches in which to crawl. And the weary trackers, with a wolf, came after; but not into the cave. For lying there, Shaitan fought down the urge to create a mist and flee into it (what, into the sunlight?) and instead willed it that the men would turn back. The grey one was their guide: he fastened upon its mind with his vampire awareness, spelling out the doom which would befall if it should enter. The wolf pawed the remains of their meal at the entrance where they\u0027d tossed the scraps, but came no farther. The men, Szgany Hagi, saw the skin, hair and bones, and knew that this had been a goat. And one of them said, \u0027A bear, probably a big one. This must be his lair. See, these remains are fresh. Why, he might even be at home!\u0027 And so they passed on by. Shaitan waited a moment, then crept to the entrance. And keeping well back from the dazzle, he taxed his eyes to watch the men move away, marvelling greatly that they went in brilliant sunlight, with no apparent harm! Then ... he was filled with bitter resentment. They lived here, where he could not; they hunted here, living on the earth\u0027s simple things, which he could not. It was their place, their haven (their heaven?) and could never be his except... in the dark of night. Well, and so they lived and hunted here: indeed, they even hunted Shaitan himself! But tomorrow and tomorrow there would be other days, and long dark nights, when he would hunt in his own right - for men! Aye, and then he would turn their heaven into a hell. It was a solemn promise, which Shaitan made unto himself... Sunside\u0027s day was long and long, seeming interminable to Shaitan; but at last the shadows lengthened, the sun became a hot, smoky red blister on the south-eastern horizon, and the first pale stars blinked into being high over the spine of the barrier mountains. Twilight came down, and it was time to move on. At which point there came a diversion. Emerging from the cave into the gloom of evening, Shaitan was startled to hear a wailing and moaning, and to observe the approach of two figures - whom he recognized at once. The one who cried out and tore at his hair came, after all, as no great surprise: for this was the treacherous thrall, Vidra Gogosita, who seemed in a bad way indeed. But the other figure, advancing upon Shaitan quietly, hollow-cheeked and flame-eyed, was a shocking sight indeed. For he - - was a dead man! He - was in fact Dezmir Babeni! Ah, but there had been changes. He was still bearded, and shortish in the limbs and trunk as before, but much of the fat was gone from him now so that he no longer appeared squat. He was a leaner Dezmir Babeni, certainly, but just as surely the same man. And he was no longer dead. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" This was a new thing. Before Babeni, Shaitan had never so depleted a man, or even a trog, as to kill him. The creatures who were his thralls had not died but lived only to accommodate Shaitan\u0027s needs. This man, however, had died. Babeni was dead ... or undead? \u0027Master! Master!\u0027 the young Gogosita came ghosting to Shaitan, hands fluttering. \u0027Take me back, I beg you! I have nowhere else to go, nowhere else to be.\u0027 Shaitan did not even look at him but put him aside. For his gaze was rapt upon Babeni. And Babeni\u0027s rapt upon him, and full of hatred! The undead man growled and lurched forward, his pale grey hands reaching, his eyes like sulphur pits, lit with fire in their cores. \u0027You!\u0027 he accused, his voice harsh and rasping. \u0027You, Shaitan, you did this thing to me. And now this youth tells me you\u0027ve done other things to my daughter!\u0027 He bore down on Shaitan, grasped him, went to fasten his teeth in his neck. And Shaitan saw how those teeth were grown into fangs! Stunned until now, immobilized, finally he summoned his vampire strength to throw the other off, then leaped on him to choke him. Babeni\u0027s grey face turned purple under the crushing power of Shaitan\u0027s hands, but still he fought back and his body heaved with an impossible strength. Amazed, Shaitan knocked Babeni\u0027s head again and again upon the hard and stony ground, until the skull at the back was soft and dented. Finally the other quit fighting and lay back. But he was not dead and his limbs twitched, and his yellow eyes followed Shaitan wherever he moved. And Shaitan looked at him and thought: The strength of your body is second only to mine, and its wounds heal even as fast. In relieving you of your frail human life, I have given you this unlife. However unwittingly, it seems I have bestowed certain powers upon you! And yet you are not my thrall and will not accept me as your master. Wherefore I must kill you, lest you become a rival. But how may I kill you, if you are undead? Babeni was even now taking up a jagged rock, staggering to his feet, mewling brokenly as he lurched towards Shaitan. Spittle dribbled from a corner of his mouth and his head and neck were soaked in blood; because of his damaged brain, he came on lopsidedly, like an idiot. Shaitan stepped aside, tripped him, looked for a large stone with which to finish it. But: \u0027How may I kill you?\u0027 he asked out loud, as yet again the mewling thing clambered upright. \u0027Master,\u0027 Vidra Gogosita clawed at his arm. \u0027I know how to kill him!\u0027 For Vidra had sat at the campfire one time when Turgo Zolte had been telling his stories. \u0027Oh?\u0027 Shaitan looked at him, at the same time avoiding the staggering cripple. \u0027And would you redeem yourself? Well, and maybe you have your uses after all. Say on then: what will it take to put him down?\u0027 \u0027A stake through his heart,\u0027 Vidra gasped. \u0027To fix him in place. Then cut off his head. Finally, burn him - all of his pieces!\u0027 \u0027All of that?\u0027 Vidra nodded. \u0027This is how the Szgany Hagi will deal with you, if they catch you!\u0027 Shaitan nodded. \u0027Indeed? Then we must test this thing. You shall build me a fire.\u0027 And to Ilya Sul where he fended off the thing which had been Dezmir Babeni: \u0027Put your bolt through his heart.\u0027 The other obeyed and Babeni was knocked down, stretched out upon the ground, with only the flight of the bolt sticking up from his chest. He bled the merest trickle, even when Sul took a knife and commenced sawing through his neck, its pipes and the bones of his spine. Through all of which the undead man\u0027s limbs jerked and twitched, and air whistled in and out of his chomping jaws, until the pipes were severed and the head detached. Then they burned him, but even burning he thrashed about while his fats were rendered down ... Observing all, Shaitan nodded again. \u0027And this is how they would deal with me? Hah! But if you think he died hard, then you don\u0027t know the half of it. The Hagi shall not catch me, Vidra Gogosita; and if they do, I will not be the one to die.\u0027 Meanwhile, Ilya Sul had built the fire to a roaring blaze. \u0027I... I can\u0027t seem to warm myself,\u0027 he complained, examining his cold grey arms. \u0027I am the same,\u0027 Vidra agreed. \u0027For we have known the kiss of the great Wampir, our master Shaitan.\u0027 And again Shaitan was interested. \u0027Wampir?\u0027 Vidra explained, repeating all that he had heard from Turgo Zolte. And when he was done: \u0027Ah, no!\u0027 said Shaitan. \u0027For the wampir is a common bat, a dull creature which is my Starside familiar. But I am uncommon. Wherefore I shall be called ... Wamphyri! Aye, for I like the sound of it. The great Lord Shaitan, first of the Wamphyri! So be it.\u0027 They crossed the mountains in the night, and on the way Shaitan questioned Vidra as to how he had found him. The youth answered that he had \u0027felt\u0027 his master in his mind, and had known that he must go to him. On the way, as the power of the sun\u0027s rays waned, he had met with Dezmir Babeni, who had hidden in a crack in a cliff to keep himself out of the sunlight. Being undead, he had been more nearly like unto Shaitan, and the sun was his mortal enemy. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" The night passed, and as the three - Shaitan, Vidra and Ilya Sul - descended into Starside, so they discovered Shaitan\u0027s trog thralls waiting. They, too, had known where to find their master. And now they numbered thirteen in all: the three, plus seven female trogs and three male. And Shaitan called all of the others his disciples. Then they saw a light shining up into the night, a white and hazy shimmer unlike the coldly flickering auroras of the north, which Ilya Sul said must be the fallen white sun, which some called a gate into hell. \u0027White sun?\u0027 Shaitan had drawn back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-6.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) The vampires have been vanquished!
