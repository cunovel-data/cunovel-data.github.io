And: \u0027Yes, whatever you say,\u0027 he answered Varna.\\n\\n \u0027Consider it done then,\u0027 said the other. \u0027Now be off, and enjoy what time you have left as a free man.\u0027\\n\\n Nana had a large cave close to the main entrance. There, where beams of sunlight shot in through holes in the perforated rock and dust motes drifted like specks of gold, she sat Nathan down on a blanket on a ledge carved in the wall. And while she saw to the needs of two old ladies in her care - in the course of preparing their food - she talked to him and questioned him over her shoulder. In a little while he stopped answering, and Nana saw that he\u0027d stretched out and gone to sleep.\\n\\n Then, as the old ones ate their food Nana sat beside him. She stroked the lines from his brow, cried all the tears she\u0027d stored up for so long, and loved her son for all the lonesome times she\u0027d missed loving him ...\\n\\n Nathan dreamed of Maglore, who in any case had never been far from his thoughts since his escape from Rune-manse; an image of the man, the vampire Lord, the monster, had seemed printed indelibly on his inner eye, but faintly, like an after-image.\\n\\n Maglore in his aerie, in a darkened room, alone, with a smile on his ancient, evil face and his eyes half-closed, and spider hands with spindly fingers resting upon an image of his sigil, the hammered gold loop with a half-twist. Nathan dreamed of the Seer Lord, and knew that Maglore in turn dreamed of him, of Nathan!\\n\\n He conjured the numbers vortex and washed Maglore away in its seething swirl - and saw the smile on his fading face turn to a scowl - before he drifted deeper into sleep ...\\n\\n He dreamed of his wolves. They had felt the swirl of the vortex and stirred in their mountain cave. He knew that their yellow eyes blinked in the gloom, and could feel their warmth and smell the musty heat of their curled bodies. But they were tired and he should let them sleep; it was sufficient that they acknowledged his return ...\\n\\n His freely drifting mind touched upon the deadspeak minds of Sunside\u0027s Great Majority: a Jiving mind listening in on the dead. They knew him at once, but the message of their swiftly receding whispers was as vague and mysterious as ever: That one, Nathan!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the Thyre speak for him; they say there\u0027s no harm in him, only good.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So was his father good, in his time. But in the end?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We could tell him much.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We daren\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n Among them was a voice which was very faint. \u0027I, Iasef Karis, could tell him most of all.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And be shunned among the dead forever?\u0027 The others were alarmed.\\n\\n \u0027You are cold and cruel,\u0027 the faint one replied.\\n\\n \u0027But not as cold and cruel as the Wamphyri necromancer who is his brother!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He is a vampire. They are not the same.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can Nathan live forever, then? And what will he be when he dies? Ah, and will he stay dead?\u0027\\n\\n Finally, reluctantly: \u0027Perhaps you are right,\u0027 said Jasef Karis. With which their dead voices faded away entirely as the teeming dead fell silent in their graves and resting places ...\\n\\n At last it was Eygor Killglance\u0027s turn; the leathery amalgam which was Eygor, blind and dead in his pit in Madmanse. But Eygor didn\u0027t talk about Nathan, he talked to him. The killing eye, Nathan. It can be yours!\u0027 The clotted gurgle of his mind spanned all the miles between. \u0027Now look, and see what my sons did to me!\u0027\\n\\n Nathan stood at the feet of the Thing in the pit again, and stared up at its dead face, its closed eyes which even now, in his dream, creaked open! And a pair of blind white orbs huge as the eggs of swans, white as shining marble, wept acid tears on to a fretted, crumbling cheek!\\n\\n \u0027Only see how I cry,\u0027 said Eygor, \u0027because my eyes are blind and white. Ah, but upon a time the right one was filled with blood! See!\u0027 And at once, the right eye of the gargoyle dripped scarlet. \u0027While the left was full of pus!\u0027 And indeed the left one turned yellow, and swelled like a boil about to burst. And Nathan knew that if it did and the poison splashed him, then that he would be infected, heir to Egyor\u0027s eyes!\\n\\n He came shouting awake ...!\\n\\n But the eyes were gone. The original great white blind glaring eyes (like the eye which Thikkoul had seen in Nathan\u0027s stars, perhaps?), the bloody eye and the yellow one, too: gone! Only his mother\u0027s eyes, Nana\u0027s, were there to greet him where he jerked violently upright. And gazing back worriedly into his, all they contained was love and concern.\\n\\n For Nathan was more than ever like Harry Keogh before him, and she knew from his mumbling that he talked to ... people, in his sleep; or at least listened to them talking to each other. But mainly she was concerned because of who these people were, and the fact that they were no more ...\\n\\n Aye, he was more than ever like his Necroscope father, which could be a blessing -\\n\\n - Or a curse.\\n\\n Nathan and Misha were married at \u0027noon\u0027, when the sun stood at its highest point far to the south and central over the distant desert. The ceremony was simple; Lardis presided; all of Sanctuary Rock\u0027s workforce was present, almost a hundred and forty of them. Times were hard but Lardis had done his best, providing bread and wine and a beast turning on a spit over a fire.\\n\\n At the high point of the affair the old Lidesci gathered the couple and their parents to him - Misha in white, Nathan in his freshly cleaned Thyre clothing, which by Szgany standards was still exceptionally fine gear -and with Nana standing face to face with Misha, and Varna glowering at Nathan, then Lardis commenced to say the approved words:\\n\\n \u0027Varna Zanesti, what can you say of this girl, your daughter Misha?\u0027\\n\\n That she\u0027s innocent, unknown by man or monster,\u0027 Varna growled. \u0027Also that she\u0027s obedient and good. Far too good for this one!\u0027\\n\\n Nathan was obliged to back off a step and lower his head. It was all part of the ritual.\\n\\n \u0027And Nana Kiklu,\u0027 Lardis turned to her. \u0027What have you to say to that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No mere girl is good enough for a son of mine,\u0027 Nana answered, tilting her chin and sniffing at Misha. \u0027I can only hope that their children take more after him.\u0027 But not too closely after their grandfather!\\n\\n Lardis turned to the couple. \u0027And do you love each other?\u0027 They answered yes. \u0027So you may, and from this time forward you have that right - to love with your hearts and your bodies - for you\u0027re now man and wife!\u0027\\n\\n They kissed; people applauded; everyone enjoyed a little food, and toasted the health of the couple in wine. There was music and the younger ones danced, those who had the strength for it. But at their first opportunity, Nathan and Misha slipped quietly away ...\\n\\n Their travois was waiting behind bushes under the south-west facing wall of the Rock. There Misha made ;\"Nathan look away - Three years is a long time, after ; all!\u0027 - while she changed into Traveller clothes and folded her dress into a pillowcase, and discreetly averted her eyes as he likewise changed. It was the Szgany way. Then, dragging the light-framed travois behind them, they went out into the forest. Heading south-east, they skirted the Rock along an old trail, but half-way towards Settlement turned off into virgin woods and found a place where the bracken stood tall.\\n\\n In the heart of the bracken Nathan put up their shelter, a skin stretched over the bole of a fallen tree, made fast to projecting branches, while Misha cleared the ground and spread their blankets underneath. And with mixed feelings they stood looking at the finished job. Everything seemed to be melting into a blur now for Nathan. He still daren\u0027t believe that he had really escaped from Turgosheim; yet here he was, married to Misha, and their first bed ready for them. She didn\u0027t seem changed; it might be as if he\u0027d never been away.\\n\\n \u0027Our home for half a day,\u0027 he finally said.\\n\\n \u0027And for part of a night,\u0027 she answered. \u0027For I won\u0027t go back till the stars are out at least. Tonight of all nights, I won\u0027t scurry and scuttle in fear of Them.\u0027\\n\\n Nathan looked ruefully at their rude shelter. \u0027Not much of a little house, is it?\u0027\\n\\n She smiled in a way he remembered and loved well enough - a smile she\u0027d kept only for him, which was half-innocent, half-brazen - and answered: \u0027People have lived, and loved, in worse than this, Nathan. Anyway, you\u0027ll remember this \"little house\" for the rest of your days. I shall see to that.\u0027\\n\\n Following which ...\\n\\n ... It was as it has always been and always will be between lovers. And for an hour, two, three, they excited, explored and exhausted each other. Misha was mainly innocent, for which they both were glad. And Nathan ... if Misha suspected anything she said nothing. And anyway, he was careful not to \u0027know\u0027 too much. From now on they could learn together, or at least he must make her believe that it was so. It wasn\u0027t so much that he deceived her, rather that he would not disappoint her.\\n\\n And he didn\u0027t, not in any measure ...\\n\\n In the time scale of the world of Nathan\u0027s father, the couple stayed in their love nest for an entire day, and one more to go before sundown. Like all young animals paired off, they loved and slept to excess; between times they replenished themselves on bread and cheese from a bundle in the travois.\\n\\n Three years without each other; now each moment spent together filled the space of an hour apart, and the husks of empty years fell aside. They got to know each other all over again, but more surely now, more certainly: like a broken wall repaired and made stronger. And the extra wrinkle here or line there: all smoothed themselves out, or seemed to, until their faces were the same yet more than before. Nathan had used to think Misha\u0027s shape was boyish; now it was all woman. She had likened his yellow hair to sunlight; now it was a misted morning, with some of the gold fading to grey.\\n\\n Eventually they left their bower and walked to Settlement, which served to revive more old memories. A handful of people were working there; Nathan met some old friends, saw a few new faces. They wandered the forest ways they\u0027d known as children, bathed in the same shingly pool at the river\u0027s bend, fell more deeply, truly in love than ever. Back in Settlement they ate a meal with friends, and Nathan stood for a while outside his old home under the stockade\u0027s west wall. Some repairs had been made but the place seemed like a shell now; at least there wasn\u0027t a flyer trap underneath it; maybe one day Nana would live here again. But live here, as she had used to in better times.\\n\\n In the shade of the forest as they returned to the bower, suddenly Nathan shivered, paused, listened. There was only the cooing of pigeons. Misha looked at him curiously. \u0027What is it?\u0027\\n\\n Frowning, he touched the golden sigil in his ear. Then he shrugged and offered an awkward smile. \u0027Only the ghosts of memories.\u0027 Or the feeling of someone listening, watching, waiting. Instinctively he shielded his mind and conjured the vortex: two perfectly logical moves, of which only the first was a good one. For Nathan didn\u0027t know that where the vortex kept certain evils at bay, it lured one other more surely than crows are lured to a cornfield. And even if he did know it would make little difference, for that one was dead.\\n\\n In any case, and long before they reached their love nest, the feeling had passed ...\\n\\n Evening fell on Sunside, and the first stars came out as the sky slowly darkened towards night. In their bower the lovers slept, touching all along their length, so close they might be one. In Settlement and other places the first fires were burning even now, lures for Starside\u0027s Lords. But the last vampire raid on Settlement had been a while ago; there was no reason why any monster should come hunting here now, and certainly not in this private place. In Nathan\u0027s metaphysical mind the numbers vortex whirled, and in its heart the mysteries of the universe were hidden behind countless mutating formulae; as were his secret thoughts. Thus the vortex was his protection -\\n\\n - And his betrayal.\\n\\n High in the mountains, in a saddle between peaks where the gold had faded to grey, a Lord and his lieutenant gazed down on Sunside, the first through scarlet eyes and the other with eyes which were feral. The latter was Zahar (once Zahar Sucksthrall, but no longer), and his master was the Lord Nestor of the Wamphyri, an awesome necromancer whose rapid rise to power had made him a living legend on all the levels of Starside\u0027s last aerie. Their flyers rested a little apart, nodding their great, slate-grey heads in that curiously vacant way of theirs.\\n\\n Zahar knew why they had come here: it was a habit of Nestor\u0027s to rest here a while, this very spot, and gaze down on Sunside before a raid. Always here, over Settlement. But while he found a constant fascination with the place, he had never once raided in the town. In the past he\u0027d always given the same reason: \u0027I think ... I know this place. But there\u0027s nothing here that I want, not any longer.\u0027\\n\\n Tonight was different. Wratha had suggested that she and Nestor might raid together, yet he had flown out early with just Zahar in attendance. Just the two of them, without even a warrior. And Nestor\u0027s gaze was very keen, even eager tonight as he looked down on the glow-worm flicker of the town\u0027s fires; and Zahar sensed within him an eagerness, a strange cold passion, and a purpose.\\n\\n For a while the lieutenant fidgeted, then asked: \u0027Do we raid here tonight? Do we recruit? If so we should be careful, for these people have a reputation. Those fires could well be lures!\u0027\\n\\n Nestor merely glanced at him, but at least the question had drawn him back to earth. \u0027We hunt,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Hah!\u0027 Zahar snorted appreciatively. Tor women?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For a couple, male and female,\u0027 Nestor\u0027s voice was like a low wind out of the Icelands, cold and foreboding. \u0027A great enemy of mine who went away and is now returned. A treacherous Szgany dog and his bitch, who plotted against me. Even now they are hiding from me, in the woods where they always hid. But I shall find them now as I found them then.\u0027\\n\\n Zahar stared at him, feared him. Nestor had no background. There was nothing in his past to guide his future. Except this, perhaps, whatever it was. And he was pure as pure Wamphyri! All Nestor knew, he\u0027d learned in Old Starside\u0027s last aerie. And despite that the ways of the aerie were hard, he\u0027d learned fast. Add to this the fact that he was a necromancer ... the Lord Nestor\u0027s mind and his ways were unknowable.\\n\\n Still, Zahar thought that he should make some answer. \u0027How will you find this enemy, Lord?\u0027\\n\\n Again Nestor\u0027s glance, and his grim smile. \u0027He sleeps and dreams,\u0027 he said. \u0027But I know his dreams, for they penetrate my own like darts.\u0027\\n\\n Zahar said nothing. He had been right: his master\u0027s mind was entirely unknowable.\\n\\n \u0027Now listen,\u0027 Nestor continued with more animation.\\n\\n \u0027In the twilight before the dawn I sensed his return, and dreamed that I went to fetch him into Starside to punish him. But my dream was ominous, and in the hour of my triumph I fell foul of some nameless fate. Tonight, leaving Wratha to sleep on, I rose early and came down to my apartments, from where I heard the Lord Canker Canison singing to the moon. Because they say he is touched with oneiromancy, I mentioned the dream to him. He howled like a wolf and told me that the future is inviolable; the only danger lies in trying to read or alter it; what will be will be. I agree with that last: what will be will be. Except...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Lord?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If aught befalls me, will my enemy go free? I can\u0027t bear the thought of that.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027No, for if I\u0027m destined for hell I want to know that my enemy got there before me, or follows close behind, at least! These are my instructions:\\n\\n \u0027He is mine and you shall take the girl. If all goes well we head direct for Starside. But if I should come to grief my order is this: drop the girl and take him! Do you understand?\u0027 His voice was suddenly sharp.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Lord.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027For I don\u0027t mind that she lives, only that he should not! And in no circumstance are they to be allowed to live together. Which is why you will take him and head for Starside. For I\u0027ve heard of a certain legend, and I\u0027m determined that he shall be the one to test it.\u0027\\n\\n He explained his meaning in more detail, then continued: \u0027Zahar, a dream is only a dream and I\u0027m not afraid of it. Nor do I fear anything. But if aught should go astray, don\u0027t fail me. For I am the Lord Nestor and life and death are one to me, and even in the worst possible future, I shaJI be back!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I believe you, Lord,\u0027 said Zahar.\\n\\n They went to their beasts and mounted up. And Nestor said, \u0027Now follow close behind, and I\u0027ll take you to them.\u0027\\n\\n Zahar kept his thoughts well guarded where he goaded his flyer into the air. But in the eastern foothills and along the peaks he\u0027d seen banks of mist forming, and knew that the Wamphyri hunted there. While Nestor pursued dreams and ghosts out of his unknown past, they hunted for the good things of life: for the blood which is the life, for women and slaves, and for the sheer joy of it. Huh.\u0027 Not much of joy in Nestor. But then, there\u0027d not been a deal of it in Vasagi either! And this one had his egg.\\n\\n Nestor \u0027heard\u0027 none of this; his damaged mind was full of other things and remembered only those which he wanted to remember. And as his flyer arched its wings and soughed down the wind towards the tree-line, he was maddened by the swirl of alien numbers rushing faster and faster in his brain. Now, at long last, he would track the maelstrom to its source and destroy it - destroy him - forever. As he should have destroyed him in the far, dim, all but forgotten past...\\n\\n The mist on the mountains. Like Zahar, Nana Kiklu had seen it, too, and had gone straight to Lardis. Now they were out searching for the newlyweds, Nana in one direction and Lardis in the other. He was the one who found them, and with time to spare, or so he thought. But in fact he was just too late.\\n\\n Arm in arm, they headed for the Rock along a foothill trail. Trudging and weary, they dragged their worldly goods behind them. Lardis saw them, sighed his relief and hurried forward ... only to freeze as the night air throbbed and the starlight seemed to dim a little, and a shadow went wafting overhead! Lardis fell into a crouch, snapped his shotgun shut, and looked up. He saw them - flyers, a pair - banking against the hillside, and stooping towards the lovers like hawks! And now they too felt the throbbing of the air, looked up and saw the swooping flyers. Instinctively, Misha flew into Nathan\u0027s arms.\\n\\n This way!\u0027 Lardis bellowed. To me!\u0027 They saw him, ran towards him. The flyers veered a little and their belly pouches yawned open; their wings formed arches where they seemed almost to drift down upon the pair.\\n\\n \u0027Down!\u0027 Lardis yelled. \u0027Get down!\u0027\\n\\n The flyers were upon them, buffeting them apart; the one which pursued Nathan made to scoop him up; he stumbled and the flap of the thing\u0027s pouch sent him flying. It formed its wings into air-traps and hovered, following him where he tumbled down a scree slide.\\n\\n Frantically, Lardis swung his weapon towards the other beast but daren\u0027t fire; Misha was in the way. The creature was almost upon her when suddenly ... she gave a scream and disappeared! She was the victim of one of Lardis\u0027s pits! But better that than the other. Far better! She might be injured, but she was safe for the moment. And the old Lidesci launched himself feet-first down the scree slide after Nathan.\\n\\n Nathan was on his feet. He turned to look back up the slope - and the flyer was there, right behind him! He saw it, and saw that its rider was ...\\n\\n ... Nestor!\\n\\n Nathan might not know the face - that twisted, snarling visage with its scarlet, glaring eyes - but he would recognize the mind anywhere, however warped and changed it had become. At close range there was no mistaking it; he felt its hatred, and knew that recognition was mutual. Nestor was a Power now, and Nathan\u0027s own telepathy that much more enhanced.\\n\\n You! The word was a hiss, burning like acid as it flowed from Nestor\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \u0027Nestor!\u0027 Nathan gasped, as the flyer\u0027s head passed over him and its belly pouch yawned. He smelled its stench ... and in the same moment heard Lardis\u0027s yell:\\n\\n \u0027Get down!\u0027 A split second later and the old Lidesci came skidding on his heels and his rump, collided with Nathan and sent him flying. The two of them rolled and tumbled; but relentless as a shadow and almost as close, the flyer followed after. They hit the bottom of the slope, and Lardis was first on his feet. Growling like a bear he turned his weapon on the flyer and discharged it pointblank into the creature\u0027s eyes - once, twice!\\n\\n The thing screamed high and shrill, lashed its head left and right, and its wings pounded frantically, uselessly at the air. Then, as a wingtip struck the slope, the beast tilted to one side, which threatened to unseat its rider. Yelling like a madman, Lardis reloaded and aimed at the vampire Lord.\\n\\n And even if Nathan would wish it otherwise, there was nothing he could do about the rest of it. Dazed and still trying to climb to his feet, he heard the twin shotgun blasts and felt Nestor\u0027s agony! And again he and Lardis were bowled over as the stricken flyer\u0027s thrusters uncoiled downwards and drove it out and away into the night, with Nestor lolling and jerking in the saddle.\\n\\n By now Sunside lay under a blanket of mist, and because the main body of Wamphyri hunters were in the east, it could only be a natural mist rising from the woods and rivers of the region. Nestor\u0027s flyer dipped low and tore a soft hole in the stuff, which quickly filled in behind it.\\n\\n Lardis was yelling, \u0027I got the bastard! I got him in the eyes, like I told you! If my aim had been better I could have taken his head off!\u0027\\n\\n The mist rolled up and covered them, and passed up the slope. And despite that Lardis had been talking about Nestor, there was only one thought in Nathan\u0027s mind now: \u0027Misha?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 Lardis growled. \u0027She fell into one of our own pits. And that other flyer may still be around, might even have landed!\u0027 Reloading his shotgun, he headed up the slippery scree slope. But even as they began climbing, so Zahar came gliding from above and fell on them. It was as swift as that: the mist opened and the flyer was there.\\n\\n Lardis got off a shot before he was buffeted aside. He was on his feet again in a moment, aiming at a nodding, mist-wreathed head, squeezing the trigger. And the gun blew up in his hands! One of the old cartridges, a bad one, had finally let him down. Blown backwards and off his feet, he waited for the shock to pass, then struggled upright and looked for Nathan ... and saw nothing but the mist. But in a little while he found the wind to climb the slope.\\n\\n Misha was waiting at the top, shivering and dishevelled but otherwise unharmed. She took Lardis\u0027s hand and helped him up, then grabbed him and looked into his eyes. He could only lower his head and look away ...\\n\\n EPILOGUE\\n\\n Unconscious from the flyer\u0027s gases, Nathan lolled in Zahar\u0027s arms where the vampire lieutenant carried him across the wormhole-riddled terrain surrounding the hell-lands Gate and tossed him down on top of its low crater wall. Beyond that wall, snug as an eye in its socket, the vastly glaring Gate shone with a cold white light, causing Zahar to lower his eyelids half-way shut and put up a hand against the dazzle.\\n\\n He found a toe-hold and stepped up onto the wall, picked Nathan up and paced forward to the very \u0027skin\u0027 of the shining hemisphere of light. There he paused, looked at the man in his arms and shrugged. There seemed very little of a \u0027great enemy\u0027 in this one, and as any vampire would know, there were better uses for good Szgany flesh than this! On the other hand, his master\u0027s warning couldn\u0027t be ignored; Zahar dared not fail him who had sworn to return. For Nestor was a Lord and crafty necromancer, while Zahar was only a lieutenant.\\n\\n Well, time now to get it over with. He cradled Nathan like a child in one arm, and slapped his face until his eyes flickered open. \u0027What?\u0027 Nathan groaned, rolling his head and seeing first Zahar\u0027s awful face, and then the blinding light spilling from the Gate! The hell-lands portal, which he knew at once, glaring like ... like \u0027a great blind eye\u0027!\\n\\n Zahar grinned at him and said: \u0027Courtesy of the Lord Nestor. Whoever you are, this world has seen the last of you. But I hope they make you welcome in hell!\u0027 And so saying he spilled Nathan out of his arms into the glare, which absorbed him in a moment, effortlessly and without a sound, like an eye blinking away the irritation of a dust mote ...\\n\\n Far to the east in a blocked pit in Madmanse, the gigantic monstrosity which was Eygor Killglance lay where he had died, slumped against a nitre-streaked wall, and groaned a vast and terrible deadspeak groan. He was dead, the physical Eygor, but his mind of course went on. Except there was no one now to know it, not with any certainty. For like the guttering of a distant candle jn the ultimate darkness of death, Eygor had seen Nathan\u0027s light go out. Which could mean only one thing: that the Necroscope was no more.\\n\\n In the higher levels of the promontory, called Rune-manse, perhaps Maglore \u0027heard\u0027 something of Eygor\u0027s groaning; perhaps he \u0027felt\u0027 something of Nathan\u0027s passing. At any rate he rushed to his room of meditation and placed his trembling fingers on the sigil shaped in gold, and let his mind drift out from Turgosheim, then hurtle west at the unthinkable speed of thought, which is instantaneous. But the sigil was lifeless now, merely a strangely twisted mass of heavy metal, and Maglore\u0027s \u0027window on an unknown world\u0027 was closed. It was weird, because even though Nathan\u0027s aura was gone, the feeling persisted that he was not dead. What, then? Undead? Locked in that metamorphic sleep which precedes the vampire condition? Had he finally succumbed to the seduction of vampirism? Did Wratha or one of hers have him? And Maglore sighed. Better perhaps if he had made him his own after all...\\n\\n In all the dreaming places of the Thyre, suddenly the darkness was that much deeper. For the ancients also knew of Nathan\u0027s passing from this world, but they knew a little more than the rest: that he was not dead. For if so he would be one with them, an honoured member of an elite, \u0027extinct\u0027 society, where his dead-speak voice would always be welcome. No, he was not dead but removed from them, taken away, transported to a place from which no one ever returned.\\n\\n The teeming dead of Sunside knew it, too, and felt safer for it, however shamefully. But men reap what they sow, and in the child there is always that of the father. Perhaps Nathan had posed a threat, and perhaps not. Whatever, it made no difference now for he was gone. And of all of them who had passed into Sunside\u0027s air and earth, only Jasef Karis missed him and wished that he had spoken to him.\\n\\n But not a one of them - not Eygor, Maglore, the Thyre, or all the dead of Sunside put together - could ever have dreamed that they would hear Nathan\u0027s dead-speak voice again, or see his candle burning in the darkness as before .. .\\n\\n Nestor\u0027s awakening was slow and painful. His eyes were burning, his back had been very nearly broken, but his mind ... was free of numbers! And with that, it all came back to him:\\n\\n ... His flyer, blinded, with its face half shot away and its tiny brain peppered with poisonous silver pellets. Nestor, too, reeling in the saddle with sightless eyes, his face a raw red mess and consciousness slipping as he fought to command his crippled beast up, away, back to Starside. He remembered a long low glide, and his inability to impress himself on the flyer\u0027s mind. The wonder was that the beast had stayed aloft so long.\\n\\n . .. Then the crash: the whiplash as he was hurled from the flyer\u0027s back, his body somersaulting, smashing against the bole of a great tree, falling through branches which snapped under his weight, down to the forest\u0027s floor. And the darkness.\\n\\n Following which: Ministering hands? Kindness? Ointments and bandages, to assist in the healing process which Nestor\u0027s leech had already commenced? Brief bouts of consciousness, in which he had known that people moved about him, caring for him, even feeding him a vile soup, which his body accepted readily enough despite that it was not his usual fare. It could only mean that he had made it back to Starside, where Wratha had found him crashed among the great hardy firs of the barrier range below the tree-line, and brought him into the last aerie.\\n\\n But when he had tried to speak to her, it was not the Lady Wratha\u0027s voice which answered him. And because his eyes were so badly damaged and bandaged, he\u0027d not seen the ones who covered his shivering body with blankets to keep him warm, and fed him, and pricked the silver shot out of his face, and generally succoured him through his fever.\\n\\n Until now, finally, he heard their whispers, and felt once more the pain in his back, the agony of his ruined face. But he held still as they peeled away the bandages, and listened to their whispers tailing off as they sensed that he was awake. Then, despite the pain of tearing scabs, he gradually forced his eyes open and felt pus begin to ooze as something of sight returned. But -\\n\\n - Was the room dark, or was it his eyes? It was both, he knew. He was healing, but not yet fully healed. For even a dark room would appear as daylight to one who was Wamphyri. But this room seemed full of a thick grey mist, and his eyes burned like fire when he blinked them to clear his vision. Except his vision would not clear. He was half-blind, and a long way yet to go before his vampire repaired him back to new.\\n\\n He stirred, groaned, moved his limbs and tested his body. And like shadows the ones who had saved him backed off, melted away and out of this misty room of vague grey shapes and musty odours. Their movements seemed strange, stumbling, crippled as badly as Nestor himself and perhaps worse. For he was at least aware of his blood surging and knew that his limbs were his own again. He was weak but would be strong, and given time he would see as well as ever. But not yet for a while.\\n\\n Now that Nestor was alone he put out a trembling hand to feel his bed, the wall, the edge of a table. All of wood, and warm. In no way the familiar cold grey stone of the last aerie. So what was this place? Where was he and what had awakened him? Deep down inside, some strange instinctive terror grinned and gurgled, and in the eye of memory showed him a picture out of the past: Of a flyer, gouting smoke and steam and shrivelling as its hide split open; then spilling its loathsome fats as the sun ate into it like acid and reduced it to so much slop! The sun ...! Was that what had awakened him, fear of the sun? But why? Where was he ... and what was the hour?\\n\\n Someone entered the room and Nestor froze, then fought to control his fear as the grey shadow came closer and stood beside his bed. His fear? But of what? He was the Lord Nestor of the Wamphyri! \u0027What ...?\u0027 he gurgled from scabby, tattered lips. \u0027Who ...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 The grey shape nodded. \u0027And so you\u0027ll recover and return to Starside. Good!\u0027\\n\\n But though the voice was warm and not unkind, still its tone was strange, bitter, and ... satisfied? And what was that it had said? About a return to Starside? Suddenly, anger and frustration flooded Nestor. He struggled to a sitting position and focused his damaged eyes until the grey one\u0027s misty silhouette filled in a little and his features took on shape beneath the cowl of his robe. But they were still grey features, poorly defined and oddly ... incomplete? The wraithlike figure leaned a little on a crutch which fitted under his right shoulder, and his robe hung like a shroud from his insubstantial frame.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s so dark in here,\u0027 Nestor said stupidly, or perhaps hopefully.\\n\\n The other shook his head. \u0027No, it\u0027s light enough. Or will be soon.\u0027\\n\\n Nestor\u0027s pain threatened to engulf him again. He was Wamphyri, but he was still learning their disciplines. As yet he couldn\u0027t suppress pain. He fought it back as best he was able, and asked: \u0027Who are you, and what is this place?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My name is Uruk Piatra, called Uruk Long-life,\u0027 the grey one answered with a shrug. \u0027But a misnomer, I fear. And as for this place ... it\u0027s a leper colony.\u0027\\n\\n For a single moment Nestor\u0027s brain froze: a leper colony! Leprosy, the great bane of vampires! - but in the next he was galvanized to activity. Then, swinging his legs out from under the blankets, he grabbed the dangling arms of the other\u0027s robe. But they were only empty sleeves and couldn\u0027t take his weight. They ripped at the shoulders and came away in Nestor\u0027s hands where he fell back again onto the bed. And he saw how Uruk\u0027s twig arms ended in swollen fungus nubs at the elbows!\\n\\n After that: a rush of adrenalin - a madness of vampire-induced flight in which all of Nestor\u0027s previous agonies were forgotten - a blundering confusion of blind terror as he fled the colony out into the forest. And even then no respite, for in the south the light was improving moment by moment. Grey shapes stood gaunt as ghosts in the mist of Nestor\u0027s perception as he rushed this way and that under the trees, trying to avoid them. He crashed among a cage of squawking chickens and wrecked it, fell against a fence and tumbled over it, and felt no pain now but only fear as he careened deeper into the dawn woods in search of a place to hide.\\n\\n A deep hole in which to find safety from the sun and wait out the long day. A sanctuary in which to rest and recuperate, sleep and dream ... and nightmare, certainly.\\n\\n About what had been, and what was yet to be ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-30.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \\n The vampires have been vanquished!
