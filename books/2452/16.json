{"id":80283,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Andrei Romani nodded and clapped his hands appreciatively. And: \u0027Well done, Twin Fords!\u0027 he chuckled, however grimly. \u0027A little good news at last. At least they were prepared!\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Vratza shook his head. \u0027It was that we were not prepared. Some of the men fought back! In Turgosheim, that would have been unthinkable. But afterwards, striking here, by then we were prepared. As for myself, I was unlucky .. .\u0027\n \u0027Very,\u0027 said Lardis, quietly, \u0027for it will cost you your life - this loathsomeness which your life has become, anyway. But in fact we\u0027ll be doing you a favour.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll burn me anyway?\u0027\n \u0027You know we will.\u0027\n \u0027And you call that a favour? Hah! Why then should I talk to you?\u0027\n To live a little longer,\u0027 Lardis answered, as Kirk rammed the spade into the earth again.\n The cross gave a jerk and Vratza cried, \u0027No, wait!\u0027 And in a moment: \u0027What else?\u0027 he groaned.\n Lardis considered it, stroked his chin. \u0027Six of the Wamphyri, and two - no, one - lieutenant. And thralls?\u0027\n \u0027Only those which we recruited in Twin Fords. And a few recruited here tonight, perhaps.\u0027\n \u0027Aye, precious few,\u0027 Lardis told him, grinding his teeth. \u0027For we\u0027re old hands at dealing with your victims!\u0027 Clenching his fists, he took a pace forward; Andrei Romani was there to grab his arm and bring him to a standstill.\n But the passion had gone out of Lardis in a moment; he was his own man again; he sighed and let his shoulders slump. \u0027And we have dealt with them,\u0027 he said. \u0027Most of them ... I think.\u0027\n He drove from his mind all of the gaunt, accusing faces of those he had examined and found wanting, and tried to concentrate on the business in hand. But it was hard, for he was very tired now. And: \u0027Warriors,\u0027 he growled at last. \u0027How many?\u0027\n \u0027Three,\u0027 came back the answer. \u0027But they will make more, as soon as they have the stuff for it.\u0027\n What? The \u0027stuff? Lardis couldn\u0027t contain a shudder. This nightmare thing was talking about people - decent human beings, good Szgany flesh - mutated by the Wamphyri into monsters! Deep inside he felt his gorge rising, also his fury and everlasting hatred. And he knew that he wouldn\u0027t be able to talk to Vratza Wrans-thrall for very much longer.\n But for now he must control himself, keep a tight rein on powerful Gypsy emotions, and say: \u0027Something here rings like a bell without a clapper - hollowly. You say the Wamphyri came here out of this Turgosheim with only a handful of lieutenants and warriors between them? What, and were they banished?\u0027\n \u0027Not banished, no,\u0027 Vratza answered, sweat dripping from him where he suffered the agonies of the silver spikes. \u0027But she would have been, the Lady Wratha, if the others had known of her works earlier. It was this way:\n \u0027Warriors, the aerial sort, are forbidden in Turgosheim. But as you have seen, Wratha the Risen and her colleagues made fighting creatures that flew. To do so they must work secretly, in the privacy of their manses; it was the only way they could escape the restrictions of Turgosheim and make new lives here. But in the end they were discovered, and so forced to flee.\u0027\n Lardis frowned, scratched his head. There are no warriors in Turgosheim?\u0027\n \u0027Not which fly. Of other types: a few lesser creatures are kept in the spires and manses, and there are those which roam in Turgosheim\u0027s bottoms, guarding against intruders.\u0027\n Lardis frowned, tried to picture all he\u0027d been told, and slowly nodded. He looked around at his men, narrowed his eyes, and continued the questioning. \u0027But eventually - I mean, now that this Lady Wratha has found her way here - it\u0027s entirely possible that the others will breed monsters of their own and follow her, right? And is that why she\u0027s in such a hurry to make new lieutenants, warriors, thralls?\u0027\n Up on his cross, Vratza was growing weaker by the moment. The alien stuff in his blood, which made him a vampire, was poisoned; his flesh could not repair itself; each of the small silver balls in his peppered chest was an agony in its own right. Even so, and for all his suffering, he was beginning to see Lardis Lidesci in a new light. He nodded, as much as the spike through his topknot would allow, and grunted, \u0027I can see ... can see that they will have their work cut out ... with such as you. And I believe that I... that I am not the first thrall of the Wamphyri with whom you\u0027ve spent an hour or so in ... in poJite conversation. A shame we weren\u0027t destined to meet on terms more equal.\u0027\n \u0027Aye, too true!\u0027 said Lardis with a snort. \u0027What? Equal terms? You with your gauntlet and the strength of five men, undead and almost impossible to kill? Hah! Do you remember how you were taken? And were those equal terms? No, don\u0027t try appealing to my humanity, Vratza Wransthrall. For where you and your like are concerned, I am a monster in my own right!\u0027\n Kirk Lisescu tugged urgently at his elbow. \u0027Get on with it,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027He grows weak. Get what you can out of him and then make an end of it.\u0027\n Vratza scowled down on them. \u0027I have a vampire\u0027s ears,\u0027 he growled, \u0027in which your whispers ring like shouts! Anyway, you are right: I am weak and fading fast. You should go away now and let me die. That is what I wish.\u0027\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n \u0027A few more questions,\u0027 Lardis told him, \u0027and then I\u0027ll see to your wishes personally.\u0027\n \u0027No! No!\u0027 Vratza protested, groaning. \u0027It is ... it is enough. I ... I am finished.\u0027 He hung his head, slumped down on his spikes.\n Lardis nodded, but grimly. \u0027So you\u0027re finished, are you?\u0027 he repeated the other. \u0027Yes, and I\u0027m the village idiot, lured away from a nest full of eggs by a partridge with a \"broken\" wing!\u0027\n Vratza said nothing but simply hung there, even when Kirk took up his spade again.\n Lardis waited a little while, then said, \u0027Vratza, listen to me. We can\u0027t stay here but must move on; all of us, the entire village. And we certainly don\u0027t intend to take you with us. Now, you are going to die, I make no bones about that. But how you die is up to you. This is your choice:\n \u0027Answer a few more questions, and then go cleanly, without even knowing it. Or hang there till morning when the sun comes up, and suffer the worst of all possible deaths - for such as you. Now listen: you are right and I\u0027ve had dealings with vampires before. I have seen and heard the likes of you melting in sunlight: the swift blackening and peeling of your skin, the black smoke boiling as your fats begin to melt, the awful screaming as your guts rupture and your eyeballs start out upon your cheeks. After an hour, two, three at most, you will be a black and tarry rag-thing hanging there, with all your bones protruding and your black skull frozen in a final scream! Is that what you want, Vratza Wransthrall?\u0027\n Vratza twitched a little but made no answer.\n \u0027So be it,\u0027 Lardis nodded. And: \u0027Men, bind this creature more firmly yet, with good silver wire round his arms, legs and neck. And knock a few more nails in him, so that he won\u0027t jerk himself loose when the sun\u0027s first rays hit him. Then clear the village. We\u0027re moving out, right now, within the hour.\u0027 It was a bluff, of course, but Vratza didn\u0027t know that.\n \u0027Wait.\u0027\u0027 The vampire\u0027s scarlet eyes shot open as he began to strain again, but less powerfully, against the spikes where they pierced his flesh. Then, panting, genuinely exhausted, he hung there glaring at Lardis as before; but helplessly now, hopelessly. And:\n \u0027I\u0027m good as dead anyway,\u0027 he choked the words out. \u0027Your silver is in my blood. But ... do I have your word? Will you make a clean end of it?\u0027\n Lardis nodded, and growled: \u0027Which is more than you ever granted.\u0027\n Vratza lay back his head against the cross, closed his eyes and breathed deep, and said, \u0027One bolt won\u0027t be enough. I was Wran\u0027s thrall for long and long. I\u0027ve come very close to being Wamphyri...\u0027\n Lardis nodded again, and quietly said, \u0027So I\u0027ve noted. Be sure we\u0027ll take care of it.\u0027\n \u0027Then ... ask your damned questions and be done!\u0027\n To one side of the cross and a little behind it, just out of sight of the crucified vampire, Andrei Romani\u0027s brothers placed loaded crossbows in readiness on the now empty table, and Kirk Lisescu snapped his shotgun shut. They didn\u0027t want Vratza to see their preparations, in case he should resolve to remain silent to the end. But, strangely, there was no hatred left in them now - not for this one, who was finished - just a grim determination.\n And Lardis said: \u0027You\u0027ve told us about this Lady Wratha, who is the leader of the six. Also about your master, Wran the Rage. Now tell me about the rest. Who are they, and how may we know them?\u0027\n Vratza levelled his head and stared out bleakly across ravaged, smouldering Settlement. And as if he were speaking to the night:\n \u0027Gorvi the Guile is one of them,\u0027 he said. \u0027As his name suggests, he\u0027s smooth and slippery as oil. Then there\u0027s Spiro, Wran\u0027s brother, called Killglance. They are twins, Spiro and Wran, whose Wamphyri father had the evil eye. In his youth he could kill men - kill the Szgany, burst their hearts - just by looking at them! The brothers have tried it, too, though as yet with no success to mention. Also, there\u0027s Lord Vasagi, or Vasagi the Suck, as he\u0027s known. I will not try to describe him but ... you will know him anyway, when you see him. Last but not least there\u0027s Canker Canison, who sings to the moon and leans to the fore, loping like a dog or a fox, but upright on two legs ...\u0027\n A choked cry - half-gasp, half-shout - rang out from the flickering shadows a little beyond the range of the fires, and Nathan Kiklu stumbled into view, his eyes fixed on the terrifying yet tragic figure on the cross.\n Standing in the shadows of an upended cart opposite the dull-glowing fire-pit, listening to all that Lardis had asked and every answer that Vratza Wransthrall had given him, Nathan had been witness to everything. Until a moment ago his eyes had been like misty mirrors: full of starlight, firelight, strangeness. But now, suddenly, he was alert as never before. Coming forward to stand beside Lardis, he gazed up hard-eyed at the wretched creature on the cross. And:\n \u0027What was that?\u0027 he said, his clear youth\u0027s voice contrasting with the coarseness of the night, cutting it like a knife. \u0027About a dog or a fox, a loping thing? Canker Canison, did you call him?\u0027\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n The vampire angled his huge head to look down on Nathan. He recognized him: this was one of the first faces he had seen when he regained consciousness, before the questioning commenced. Then ... the youth had seemed terrified; he\u0027d backed off a pace and stumbled, moved away to where Vratza\u0027s scarlet gaze couldn\u0027t follow. Even now he was unsteady on his feet, but no longer awed.\n And so Vratza was brought to this: even children dared to gaze upon him now, without cringing!\n Curling his fleshy upper lip, the vampire snarled and showed Nathan his twin-tipped tongue and dagger teeth. But still the youth stood there. Until finally Vratza smiled - if what he did with his face could be called smiling - and said: \u0027I was your age, when I was taken in the tithe. Since when ... I\u0027ve come a very long way.\u0027 He glanced at Lardis. \u0027Aye, even to the end.\u0027\n Lardis put an arm across Nathan\u0027s shoulder. The lad has ... he has an interest in all of this,\u0027 he said. But looking at Nathan, he knew it wasn\u0027t a healthy one.\n \u0027Oh?\u0027 Vratza cocked his head a little on one side, ques-tioningly.\n Nathan\u0027s mouth twitched in the left-hand corner. \u0027It... it\u0027s my girl. This dog-thing, Canker, knocked me down and took her from me. Since when ... she hasn\u0027t been found.\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 said Vratza, matter-of-factly. And as if Nathan no longer existed, his red eyes swivelled to look at Lardis. \u0027Is it done? Am I finished?\u0027\n Lardis nodded; Kirk Lisescu and the others took up their weapons, came from behind the cross into view.\n Vratza saw them, and fire and blood sprang into his eyes together. He opened his nightmare jaws and hissed, vibrating his forked tongue in the red-ribbed cavern of his throat.\n \u0027No, wait!\u0027 Nathan shrugged free of Lardis\u0027s arm, pointed a steady hand and finger at the monster on the cross. \u0027I want you to tell me: about Canker Canison, and about Misha. How will it be for her?\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027 Lardis got in front of Nathan, throwing up his arms as if to ward off some horror; indeed, to ward off a very real horror. \u0027Vratza, don\u0027t tell him anything! Your time has come.\u0027 He glanced at his men where they took up their positions, and nodded. But the vampire was already speaking - to Nathan.\n \u0027My last act,\u0027 he said, in a voice which bubbled like tar in a volcanic pit, \u0027to curdle your dreams now and forever. You ask about Canker? And your girl?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 Nathan had to know. But behind him the men were lifting their weapons, aiming them.\n \u0027Canker takes women for one thing only,\u0027 Vratza gurgled. \u0027To use them. And when he has used them - in whichever of the many ways he favours - then he worries them, as a wolf among goats!\u0027\n \u0027Be quiet!\u0027 Lardis roared.\n A crossbow thrummed and its bolt took Vratza close to the heart, burying itself in his torn and bloody chest until only the flight protruded. He jerked massively and coughed up blood, then sucked at the air - and continued to speak! And with his voice rising to a shriek, and finally a gale of mad laughter, he said:\n \u0027Boy, do you see this shaft in me, how it tears me? So she is torn, even now. And Canker\u0027s shaft is just as vicious. Be sure he\u0027ll fuck her heart out! Oh - ha, ha, haaaaa!\u0027\n Nathan staggered to and fro, his face pale as a papery wasp\u0027s nest, with dark punched holes for eyes and mouth. And as a second bolt joined the first (though still not on target, for the men were shooting in haste to shut Vratza up, and so missing their aim), the youth whispered:\n \u0027And now ... now I want you to die.\u0027\n Kirk Lisescu granted Nathan\u0027s wish. Twin blasts, coming in quick succession, turned the vampire\u0027s head to pulp as silver shot removed any last trace of a face.\n Blood flew in gouts and splashes; booming echoes came back thunderously, first from the stockade\u0027s walls, then from the hills; Lardis dragged Nathan roughly aside, out of the red rain. \u0027You don\u0027t want that on you,\u0027 he gasped. \u0027What? Even the air that bastard breathed is tainted!\u0027\n Again Nathan shook him off, then staggered away into the night to be sick. Once, hearing shouting, he looked back and saw the cross and the thing upon it as a black silhouette against the glow of the fires - but the silhouette was hideously mobile!\n Vratza Wransthrall had told how he was close to becoming Wamphyri, and he\u0027d been right. Undead meta-morphic flesh formed nests of writhing tentacles which sprang from his guts, chest, and all the massive parts of his body. Whipping and vibrating, they lashed themselves - lashed him - to the cross\u0027s upright and horizontal bar. But the men had lassoed both arms of the cross and were hauling on it furiously, until it leaned over and toppled into the fire-pit.\n Nathan heard the hiss, saw white smoke or steam rising, which he knew would soon turn black. Lardis had it right: in an hour, Vratza would be reduced to a stench and a final puff of smoke. Nothing more would remain of him -\n - Except, of course, that monstrous picture which he\u0027d painted in Nathan\u0027s head. And that might very well last for a lifetime.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n Meanwhile, Nathan\u0027s stomach in its entirety desired to be out of him ...\n Afterwards: Nathan went back to his mother\u0027s house and dug in the ruins. He wasn\u0027t satisfied that the searchers had done everything in their power. And in order to be absolutely certain, when he was finished with the house he laid bare the floor of the barn. And found nothing, not even a bloodstain.\n He stood on the spot where he\u0027d last seen Misha in the embrace of a snarling red-eyed fiend, hung his head, gritted his teeth, clenched his fists. But he didn\u0027t cry. No, he told himself, I\u0027ll shed no tears until I\u0027ve shed his blood, taken his shaggy head, smeJJed the stench of his burning hide and seen his last black trace go drifting on the wind!\n It was his Szgany vow.\n He slept again, and before the dawn went to the Zanesti house where it stood undamaged. Misha\u0027s father and surviving brother were there, pale as ghosts, sitting in silence. Before, they hadn\u0027t much cared for Nathan; now, her father cradled his head and cried on it. But Nathan wouldn\u0027t. And Misha\u0027s brother (perhaps thoughtlessly, but surely he could be forgiven) said, \u0027She never knew a man; she\u0027d been with no one; she wasn\u0027t even whole. Once, I would have killed the man who looked at her like that! And now I would kiss him - because Misha had loved him.\u0027 And he\u0027d looked at Nathan, perhaps hopefully.\n But the youth could only shake his head and say, \u0027Always remember, you have each other.\" Which, while he\u0027d not intended it that way, caused them to see that Nathan had no one. Before they could say anything he left them and went looking for Lardis, only to discover that the old Lidesci had experienced the selfsame doubts and returned to his ruined cabin on the knoll.\n Nathan joined him there, where Lardis had been at work again in the wreckage. He came across him sitting in what had been his garden, with eyes as vacant as his soul, staring south, waiting for the first glimmer of light to make a silver stain on the far faint curve which was the rim of the world. And when at last Lardis sensed him there, blinked life back into his eyes and looked at him, then Nathan said:\n \u0027What will you do, Lardis? Will it be as you told it to Vratza Wransthrall? Will you trek with your people, and turn them into Travellers as in the old days, to keep them from the Wamphyri?\u0027\n Lardisshookhishead.\u0027Some will moveon,\u0027he answered, gruffly. \u0027Can you blame them? But I will stay here. Not \"here\", you understand, but in Settlement. And I fancy a good many will stay with me. Maybe that way, by adopting at least this one of the Wamphyri\u0027s methods, we\u0027ll defeat them in the end.\u0027 \u0027By adopting their methods?\u0027\n Lardis nodded. \u0027When the Wamphyri have something, they fight to keep it. Especially territory. They are fiercely territorial, Nathan. In the old days, most of their wars were for territory, for the great aeries, the Starside stacks. Oh, they were for blood, too, and for the sheer hell of it; but mainly they were about territory. It\u0027s what drove them to go against The Dweller, and why they were destroyed. And now, finally, it\u0027s why they\u0027ve returned.\u0027\n \u0027And how will you keep Settlement?\u0027 \u0027By defending it! This sunup you\u0027ll see activity as never before in Settlement. So much to do ... I shouldn\u0027t be sitting here ... I must get on down!\u0027 He stood up.\n Nathan touched his arm. \u0027I won\u0027t be seeing it,\u0027 he said, shaking his blond head. \u0027I\u0027m heading east.\u0027 Lardis was disappointed. \u0027You\u0027re deserting me?\u0027 \u0027Never that,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027I came to find out what you would do so that eventually I\u0027d know where to find you. But first I must find Nestor.\u0027\n \u0027Nestor?\u0027 Lardis\u0027s eyebrows peaked. \u0027Why, anyone would think you weren\u0027t there last night! Nestor\u0027s gone into Starside, Nathan, in the mouth of a flyer. Look, I\u0027ve no time for this and so must speak plainly: Nestor\u0027s dead, or worse than dead! Can\u0027t you get that into your head?\u0027\n Nathan followed him down the first flight of steps cut in the steep side of the knoll. \u0027But you wounded the flyer with a bolt from one of the great crossbows,\u0027 he replied. \u0027What if it crashed? In fact, I dreamed that it crashed - on the wooded slopes over Twin Fords.\u0027\n Lardis turned to him. \u0027You dreamed it? What, and are you a seer? Since when?\u0027\n A seer? Am I? Nathan wondered. No, I don\u0027t think so. But my wolves talk to me, and sometimes I hear the dead whispering in their graves ...\n He shrugged. \u0027No, I\u0027m no seer - but I know how to hope when hope is all that\u0027s left. And I fancy you do, too, Lardis. Isn\u0027t that why you came back up here: to dig again where you have already delved enough, even knowing you\u0027d find nothing?\u0027\n After a moment Lardis sighed and nodded, turned away and continued on down. \u0027Then you have to go,\u0027 he said. \u0027Except - if your star is good to you, and likewise mine to me - you\u0027ll promise to come back one day and be my son.\u0027\n \u0027I feel I\u0027m that already,\u0027 said Nathan, lying yet at one and the same time, and however paradoxically, remaining sincere. For certainly the old Lidesci had been as much a father to him as any he had ever known. And yet behind Lardis\u0027s back where Nathan couldn\u0027t be seen, he frowned wonderingly. Because just for a moment then he\u0027d seemed to remember something else from last night\u0027s dream ... something which his wolves had told to him? Some connection between his father - his real father, Hzak Kiklu - and theirs? Some blood relationship between the two? And was that why they called him uncle?\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n Still unseen, Nathan shook his head in bewilderment. But how could that be? For quite obviously, their father had been a wolf!\n It was all very mysterious and puzzling. But then, that was frequently the way of it with Nathan\u0027s dreams: some things appeared as real and solid as the ground under his feet, while others were vague and ephemeral as ripples on a pool, or frost on the high peaks before the dawn. Some things he remembered, and others he was glad to forget, mainly because he couldn\u0027t understand them. Best to fasten on what he perceived as real, he supposed, and leave the fanciful stuff to its own devices.\n It was a mistake, but all men make them. Especially when they are under pressure. And Nathan was no exception .. .\n In the hours after dawn, as Nathan trekked for Twin Fords, the thought or question would frequently recur: But why would they take my mother?\n He would understand - and detest his understanding of it - if she had been raped, vampirized, murdered out of hand. For after all, so many had been. But taken? Nana Kiklu was no mere girl. On the other hand, she was or had been a warm and beautiful woman. Her sons had always thought so anyway, and without prejudice - especially Nathan.\n But . .. did the Wamphyri take people indiscriminately? Were they so insensitive of human life that they would simply take, defile, use or waste whatever, whoever, was available? Perhaps they were and did.\n Or perhaps it was just that they followed a simpler set of rules: blood is blood, and flesh is merely flesh. For when a hunter is hungry, is he concerned that the rabbit he shoots should have pleasing marks? Does he really care if it is past its prime? And what about the sandal-maker? What difference does it make to him which beast supplies the leather for his sandals, as long as it\u0027s supple, hard-wearing stuff?\n But on the other hand, the Wamphyri were or had been men, and the \u0027beasts\u0027 they hunted were likewise men - and women! So that they didn\u0027t just hunt for meat, or even for stuff to fashion into monstrous undead creatures, but for ... other reasons, too. And so Nathan would always come back to that, and end up wondering if Nana shared the same fate as Misha Zanesti. If Nana had been taken.\n And if she hadn\u0027t? Then what had happened to his mother, and where was she now?\n Nathan had seen a monstrous, massively armoured warrior creature ravaging destructively in the streets of Settlement, and knew that these Wamphyri fighting beasts were carnivores, indeed vampires in their own right. Maybe that was the answer: a horrific answer, to be sure, but a quick end at least. Could it be that the same monster which flattened their home had also snatched up his mother? If so, she would have been dead instantly. But never a trace of her, nothing, not even (Nathan was obliged to consider it, however flinch-ingly) a splash of red.\n The same for Misha; except that with Vratza Wrans-thrall\u0027s deliberately cruel picture still burning in Nathan\u0027s all-too-vivid imagination - and Canker Cani-son\u0027s slavering dog-voice reverberating in the vaults of his memory - he suspected or feared even worse for Misha! And however much he loathed himself for thinking it, he could only wish her dead.\n Striding east along an old Traveller trail, he found himself thinking back an hour or two, to when he and Lardis had climbed down from the house on the knoll into Settlement. Lardis\u0027s band of old comrades had been waiting for him there, with all of Settlement\u0027s citizens -those that remained, anyway - gathered together at the central meeting place to hear his words. What Lardis had said to them then had been simple and to the point, and entirely typical of him:\n \u0027All is as it was twenty years ago,\u0027 he had said. \u0027The Wamphyri are back, and we are their sport, their food, their cattle. The townships will soon be broken down, and all the Szgany sundered, scattered into small groups throughout the length and breadth of Sunside. So they, the Wamphyri, would have it. But there are differences.\n \u0027Now we have made our homes here in Settlement, and we travel no more. This is our place, built with our own strong hands - with which we must likewise defend it! And our hands are strong, even against the Wamphyri! Last night ....e were taken by surprise. Next time it will be different, when we\u0027ll make these creatures pay - and heavily! For as I\u0027ve as good as said, it\u0027s my intention to face up to them. That\u0027s my intention, yes ...\n \u0027You, however, have a choice. For I make no bones about it, the risks will be great and I won\u0027t ask anyone to stay who isn\u0027t willing to face up to it. Men will die, of that you may be sure - but so will Wamphyri! And so the choice is simple:\n \u0027Go off on your own and become Travellers, if that\u0027s how you see your future, and I\u0027ll make no objection. Live as best you may and as once we lived, never knowing what the next sundown has in store for you. You are welcome to wander wherever you will in those lands bounded by my markers. Except I would tell you this: when sundown comes, and if you\u0027re in the vicinity of Settlement, don\u0027t come here looking for succour. Those who fight for it are welcome to it, but those who desert me are gone for good.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n \u0027Now, I see that some have already moved on. Well, and I wish them luck. But any more of you who would join them, do so now. I see no profit in talking to people who\u0027ll pay me no heed anyway ...\u0027 Then Lardis had waited a while, but none had stirred. Those who would go had already left. And so at last he had continued:\n \u0027Very well. And this is what I want of you:\n \u0027You men, you take your orders from me. Likewise you women. If you lost a wife or husband last night, don\u0027t mourn but find a new one. If you lost a son or daughter, don\u0027t mourn but hate! And let your hatred be your strength.\n \u0027You old ones, sick ones who can\u0027t work or help ... you can work, you must help! No, not by furious fighting or hard labour but in those areas where your help is most needed: in keeping the fires, harvesting the fruits of the forest, tending the animals. For it\u0027s you who must feed the builders and fighters, and when they\u0027ve time to rest make sure they do so in comfort, or whatever of comfort is available. For we all have our parts to play.\n \u0027Now, to the tasks ...\u0027 And he had gone on to list them.\n Nathan had been witness to all of this; he\u0027d listened to everything the old Lidesci had said, and his admiration was boundless.\n And Lardis was inspired; he forgot nothing; so that in something less than half an hour, Settlement was more abustle than at any time in all of fourteen years. And its people were doing exactly what they had done then: preparing for war! Which left Nathan feeling like a deserter, for he knew that soon he would be out of it.\n He had mentioned this to Lardis, who told him: \u0027Son, you have your reasons which you\u0027ve explained well enough. And still I say come back one day, to where there\u0027ll always be a place for you. But before you go ...\" He\u0027d called for Ion Romani, who had got together a final list of all the night\u0027s victims.\n Scrawled upon a piece of bark were the sigils of those whom the Wamphyri had been seen to steal away, those who had been found slaughtered or changed, and those who were simply missing. Of the latter: by now a small number would be vampire thralls, hiding from the sun in the woods or the depths of mountain caves, waiting for the night when they could make for Star-side.\n And of course there were also marks for Nana Kiklu and Misha Zanesti. They were shown as missing, too, as was Nestor. And Nathan had known that Lardis didn\u0027t have the heart to show the three as he believed them to be, dead and gone forever. No, for his own wife and son were similarly listed.\n Then Lardis and Nathan had embraced, and the latter had gathered up his small bag of things and left Settlement for Twin Fords...\n Nestor would remember very little of his brief flight in the fetid pouch of the stricken flyer. Even if he\u0027d remained conscious during the trip (impossible, for the creature\u0027s gases were noxious and anaesthetizing, and it was only by a tremendous effort of will that he had stayed upright and mobile in the first place, before being taken), still he would remember very little; just darkness and clammy reek, and flexible cartilage hooks fixing him firmly in place in the pouch\u0027s confines.\n As for the beast\u0027s rapid and erratic descent from mountain peaks it had neither the strength nor the altitude to surmount - the way the massive bolt lodged deep in its body snagged in the green canopy of trees to set it spinning, crashing through pine branches and brambly undergrowth, finally to come to rest shudder-ingly on a steep wooded slope over Twin Fords; and Nestor\u0027s subsequent partial ejection from the gaping slit of the pouch - he would remember nothing whatsoever of that.\n The wonder was that he lived through any of it, let alone all of it ... and yet perhaps not such a wonder after all. For the flyer was of vampire stuff; Nestor had breathed the essence of its body; the oils of its man-trap pouch had got into his various scrapes and gouges. Insufficient to change him substantially, but perhaps enough to assist in his healing. That and his youth, his great strength, his will to survive - all of these things had combined to pull him through.\n But healing takes time, and the greatest healer of all is sleep. Up there on the hillside over the ravaged town of Twin Fords - where the leaping, cleansing flames of funeral pyres blazed up in the night, and gaunt-eyed people went stumbling through horror and chaos in the wake of Wratha\u0027s raid, much as they did in Settlement -Nestor slept. It was the sleep of exhaustion, of traumatic physical damage, of the poisons in his system which on the one hand deadened him, and on the other supported and repaired his damaged functions. And so it was a healing sleep. It would help towards healing his body, at least...\n Even so, he might have died from exposure. But the grotesque flyer was still feebly alive, its body was still warm, and only Nestor\u0027s head, shoulders and one arm dangled from the palpitating flap of its pouch. The rest of him remained inside, as yet \u0027unborn\u0027, in a metamor-phic womb of cartilage and quivering, insensate flesh. And all through the night the creature leaked its fluids and its life into the loamy soil, and its remaining warmth into Nestor. So that he lived.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n He lived and slept through the longest night of his life, and awoke in the hours before dawn to wriggle free of the flyer\u0027s pouch and fall a few harmless inches into springy moss and soft leaf-mould. And with the creature\u0027s broken body supported on the shattered stumps of pines, forming a sagging, diamond-shaped ceiling overhead, there he lay for a long time recovering his reeling senses. Some of them, at least.\n But the one which had suffered most, and one of the most basic and important at that, was memory. So that when finally Nestor could find the strength to crawl away, sit up and examine the sources of his aches and pains, the one facet of being which he could not examine was his past. Not in any great detail. Misty faces were there, only half-recognized, distorted and grimacing in his mind\u0027s eye; scenes out of his childhood, and the early years of emerging manhood; even something of the violence of his most recent past. But all of it so vague, disjointed and kaleidoscopic that it was impossible, even painful, to piece together. And Nestor had had quite enough of pain.\n The one incontestable \u0027fact1 - the one answer which surfaced time and time again whenever he considered the question of identity and being - was the repetitive phrase: \u0027I am the Lord Nestor.\u0027 So that in a little while he knew who he was at least. But what sort of a Lord was he?\n Physically: his skull still felt soft at the back, where plates of fractured bone were agonizingly mobile under an area of rough, puffy skin and subcutaneous fluids; but at least he could touch himself there without feeling sick. Apart from a slight blurriness of vision, his eyesight seemed sound in the pre-dawn light. Other than his lumpy, tender face - his nose which was definitely hooked now and still sore where the bone was knitting, split lips, and several loose teeth - no bones appeared broken in his limbs or body. In short, he knew that whatever he had survived, he would probably continue to survive it. Certainly he was hungry and thirsty for two men, and a good appetite is usually indicative of good health.\n With this in mind he looked down on the fires in Twin Fords and the black smoke hanging like a pall over the town, and wondered if he\u0027d find breakfast there. Probably, because after all he was a Lord. Also, he wondered if he would find some answers, clues as to his and the world\u0027s circumstances in general.\n As for the three-quarters dead flyer: Nestor had seen its grotesque carcass as a hugely anomalous lump in the darkness of the trees: a sprawling blanket or tent of skins, or more likely a tangled platform of fallen branches. He had considered it no further than that.\n Its true nature - the fact that it had transported him to this place, and that he had emerged from it - these things were entirely forgotten. But as twilight brightened into dawn and the rising sun lit up the peaks, and its golden light fell like a slowly descending curtain towards the tree-line, so he had cause to regard the creature anew. For now the thing in the trees was most definitely alive!\n It tried to arch its broken wings, craned a prehistoric neck for the sky, and cried out in a hissing, clacking voice. But the shattered pines had pierced its membranous wings and crushed their fragile alveolate bones, and all its energy had drained away along with its fluids. Pinned down, grounded and broken, the creature could only despair its fate, for the vampire stuff in it sensed the sunrise as surely as a lodestone senses north, except the flyer wasn\u0027t attracted but repulsed. Or would be, if it still had the power of flight.\n Walking unsteadily, gingerly around the perimeter of the triangular stand of pines at the rim of the bluff where the flyer had crashed down, Nestor observed the slate-grey, leathery skin of the thing; its long neck and spatulate head, and dull, near-vacant eyes. Despite that its head was huge, blunt and acromegalic, still there was something vaguely, disturbingly human about it; but nothing remotely human about the tentacular thrusters which it drove into the pine-needle floor each time it arched its torn manta wings, as if to assist in launching itself into flight. These reminded Nestor of nothing so much as a nest of giant maggots erupting from the belly of some dead thing.\n And at the base of its neck, where its back widened out into swept-back wings ... was that some kind of saddle?\n He might have climbed back under the canopy of the trees to make a closer inspection, but such were the thing\u0027s struggles that he feared it might flop down on top of him; and so he held back. At which point the jagged rim of sunlight creeping down across the tree-line fell squarely upon the creature - to devour it!\n So it seemed to Nestor.\n For the pines filled with stench and steam at once, as the doomed flyer\u0027s skin shrivelled and turned from slate-grey to the unwholesome blue of corruption and the texture of crumbling pumice. Its flesh quaked, bloated, split open in a dozen places, out of which its smoking fats ran like water! Then the thing screamed -a sound so thin, high and penetrating that it sliced like a sharp edge of ice on Nestor\u0027s nerves - and commenced a shuddering vibration which only ceased when several of the shattered pines were displaced and the flyer slumped down between them to the forest\u0027s floor.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n And there the sun continued its cleansing work, blazing through the trees to reduce the monster to so much glue and blackly smouldering gristle. But in a little while it became obvious that this would take hours, and what with the poisonous odour and disgusting mess, Nestor didn\u0027t wait for the end.\n But in his mind\u0027s eye, now more visions were waking; and as he began to climb down the wooded slope towards the near-distant town - and as a waft of foulness reached down to him from the dissolving flyer - he \u0027remembered\u0027 a previous rush of reeking air ...\n .. .Wind in his hair, yes, and dark diamond shapes adrift on the updrafts under glittering ice-chip stars -flyers just like that one back there, with riders proud and terrifying in saddles upon their backs - and a distant cry of horror faint on the morning air, but fading now as the scene itself faded back into vaults of memory. \u0027Wamphyri!\u0027\n Wamphyri? The cry had been real, carrying to him from the town in the \u0027V of the rivers; but the Lord Nestor ignored it in deference to its evocation.\n He paused, looked back and up the slope to where smoke and steam continued to pour from the pines, spilling out of them like a slow-motion waterfall over the rim of the bluff. Had that been his flyer back there? But that couldn\u0027t possibly be, for here he stood in sunlight and felt no harm.\n But at the same time ... did he still feel comlortabJe in the sun\u0027s warm rays? Had he ever?\n Lord Nestor of the Wamphyri...\n It seemed like a dream, some game which he\u0027d played as a child, but he remembered now how he had hunted his human prey in the deep forests, sniffing them out, searching for them with all of his vampire senses alert! Except... where were his vampire senses now?\n A vampire - indeed, Wamphyri - was he? He shrank down a little from the sun, which paid him no heed but burned, as ever, benevolently on the southern horizon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-16.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \n The vampires have been vanquished!
