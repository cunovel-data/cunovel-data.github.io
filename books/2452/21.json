{"id":80288,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"The place where Nathan lay was a cave. Despite its rudimentary furniture, whitewashed walls, and crude mosaic floor of white and green flagstones, which gave it something of a room\u0027s appearance and made it habitable, it was still a cave. Central in the high ceiling, an irregular shaft three feet in diameter and possibly artificial ascended out of sight. But in an apparently subterranean room without windows, the most surprising features were the light and the warmth.\\n\\n Down through the shaft in the ceiling streamed a beam of light, catching drifting dust motes in its ray in exactly the same way as sunlight coming into a barn through a gapped roof. Not solid sunlight, no, but light diffused and scattered, so that it emerged into the room almost as a haze. And falling onto a table near the foot of Nathan\u0027s crude wooden bed, the beam or shaft of soft yellow light struck against polished mirrors of gold to further permeate the room.\\n\\n While Rogei had caused Nathan to believe that the Thyre colonies went deep indeed, as yet he had no idea how far he\u0027d actually been carried underground. With sunlight like this to warm and light the place, however, he was sure it couldn\u0027t be far. Perhaps there were passageways leading from the Cavern of the Ancients to caves in the foot of the cliffs. In that case the shaft of light was nothing more than sunlight penetrating through some ancient chimney, and the warmth was residual of the desert.\\n\\n Wrong! said a voice in his head, one which he recognized at once as Rogei\u0027s. The Place-Under-the-Yellow-Cliffs is very deep, Nathan. But the temperature in the Thyre colonies is a constant. It is a natural thing and a great many of the caves under the desert are like this. Why would we dwell in the cold places, or for that matter the hot ones, when so many temperate labyrinth systems exist for our habitation?\\n\\n Used to this thing now, Nathan sat up in his bed. He saw that under his quilt of furs he was naked. His clothes, washed and mended, lay folded on a shelf at one side of the room. Now, with some effort - leaving his bed and dressing himself on the one hand, and on the other concentrating upon Rogei - he said: \u0027Well, it appears you were right. I was rescued from the Cavern of the Ancients and brought here. And now the elders are coming to question me.\u0027\\n\\n Like me, Rogei answered, they\u0027ve waited patiently for you to wake up. But you must be careful how you answer their questions. They demand respect, elders, and until you prove otherwise they will doubtless accuse you of desecration. Merely to enter a forbidden place is bad enough; and as for the rest of it ... Nathan sensed the other\u0027s shrug.\\n\\n The rest of what?\u0027 He was mystified. \u0027You welcomed me in and I entered; I could go no further and collapsed; I spoke to the old ones dead in their niches and upon their shelves. Then, at the end, I dreamed you came to me and comforted me.\u0027\\n\\n And touched you? Took your hand in mine?\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n No dream that, Nathan.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand.\u0027\\n\\n Probably as well, for the time being. Anyway, all is back to rights now.\\n\\n Nathan frowned but didn\u0027t press him; there were too many other things he wanted to know. For example: \u0027If this place is so deep underground, where does the light come from?\u0027\\n\\n From the surface.\\n\\n \u0027The shaft falls straight? Like a well? In that case the sun would have to stand directly overhead, which it never does.\u0027\\n\\n 7 doubt that the shaft falls straight, Rogei answered. No, for the cracks of the earth are like a maze. But some of these mazy cracks have mirrors at every junction!\\n\\n \u0027Mirrors?\u0027\\n\\n Where the bedrock breaks through the desert sand, Rogei patiently explained, there, in certain protected places, the Thyre tend and polish their mirrors. The sunlight falls upon them and is deflected into the earth\u0027s potholes and passageways. Passed from mirror to mirror, it descends into the dark places under the desert. Thus the Thyre bring a little light into their colonies.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Nathan nodded. \u0027Else you\u0027d all be blind down here.\u0027\\n\\n No, for our eyes are like trog or Wamphyri eyes ... or perhaps not like the letter\u0027s, for the night is their element. But given even a little light, the Thyre see well enough. It is just that the light is a special comfort. Down there in the hollow earth, it is treasured.\\n\\n Nathan would ask next about the Thyre talent for tongues. Apart from some small initial hesitation, Atwei\u0027s conversation had been in perfectly good Szgany. He knew of course that the Thyre traded with Travellers from time to time, but would find it astonishing if they shared the same native tongue.\\n\\n Seeing the question coming, however, and perhaps far too many more of them, Rogei cried: Wait! Enough of these questions for now, Nathan. There are more important matters. First we must talk about the Thyre elders...\\n\\n But before he could continue, Atwei returned with a yoke round her slender neck from which depended a pair of thin silver trays laden with small wooden bowls of various edibles. And looking at the bowls as she transferred them from the trays to the table, Nathan found his mouth watering. For the first time in a very long time he knew which matters were most important to him. Most immediately important, anyway.\\n\\n Seated on tiny stools on opposite sides of the table and between the mirrors, Nathan and Atwei ate. There in the shaft of diffused sunlight, she looked more golden than brown, and he noticed how her pupils shrank to match the light\u0027s greater intensity.\\n\\n The foodstuffs were fascinating, even exotic. Nathan had never imagined that these \u0027primitive\u0027 desert folk enjoyed such variety. Insisting that the food was for him, Atwei took only a little; she was simply keeping him company while he ate. And at that Nathan felt privileged. He rightly supposed himself to be the first of the Szgany to ever learn of such things. Certainly he was the first to ever taste them.\\n\\n There were walnuts marinaded in vegetable oils, yellow bladder-roots with a bittersweet taste which stung the mouth as the vegetable was crushed, fried slivers of meat in aromatic sauces, several varieties of mushroom, and small, eyeless fishes baked whole. Various fruits followed: tangy cactus apples, figs and round ripe lemons, a bunch of small grey grapes. Everything was delicious, but Nathan had found a sort of small sausage especially succulent and asked Atwei what it was made of. That was a mistake.\\n\\n \u0027Grubs of the earth,\u0027 she answered.\\n\\n And after a pause: \u0027Worms?\u0027 He cocked his head a little, inquiringly.\\n\\n \u0027Of a sort. We breed them . ..\u0027\\n\\n The meal was at an end.\\n\\n They cleaned their hands in tiny fingerbowls, following which Atwei closed her eyes, placed the fingertips of her left hand upon her brow, and sat still for a moment. Then she smiled and asked: \u0027Did you enjoy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Greatly. I thank you.\u0027\\n\\n Again she smiled. \u0027And I have thanked Him,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whoever listens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you believe there is some One?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Many of our beliefs died in the day of the white sun,\u0027 he quoted Szgany \u0027history\u0027, of which there was little enough. \u0027Men had writing, numbers, science, and some believed in a god. Very little of science survived, and almost nothing of religion. In the close vicinity of the Wamphyri, it\u0027s hard for men to have faith in a merciful god! Now when the Szgany pray or give thanks, they offer them to their stars, which are remote even beyond the influence of the vampires.\u0027\\n\\n Then if I were you, Rogei said in his mind, I would seek out my guardian star right now! Nathan, I have kept apart out of common decency; the Thyre require privacy for eating; Atwei has honoured you greatly. But finally the time has come when we must talk about the elders!\\n\\n \u0027Very well,\u0027 he answered.\\n\\n \u0027Your pardon?\u0027 Atwei lifted an eyebrow.\\n\\n \u0027I was talking to Rogei,\u0027 he told her.\\n\\n Her eyebrows went up higher yet, worriedly. \u0027You should not have got up and dressed yourself. I told you that you must wait, until you had your strength back. You were delirious for a long time and ... you could be again!\u0027\\n\\n Nathan sighed and shook his head. \u0027I\u0027m a little weak,\u0027 he said, \u0027that\u0027s all.\u0027 But then he had an idea. \u0027Atwei, listen to me: could you be delirious, too?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I? Now? Of course not!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good! Now tell me if I\u0027m correct: while I am limited in my ability to read minds, you are not. Right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If a mind is telepathic, I can read it,\u0027 she said, frowning. \u0027Also, I can partially block another mind trying to read mine. These things come with practice. As yet, your talent is undeveloped. But your mind has the capacity.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was wondering,\u0027 he said, \u0027if you could talk to Rogei through me? If you were to enter my mind right now, would you be able to overhear our conversation?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Eavesdrop on an Ancient?\u0027 She sat up straighter, looked more worried yet. \u0027Even an elder would think twice!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You believe me, then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are friends,\u0027 Atwei hesitated a little, \u0027you said it yourself. It takes two to build a friendship. If one lies it may be broken and have no value. This is proven; not only among the Thyre but also the Szgany, I think? And so I must believe you - at least until you are a proven liar.\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Rogei sighed in Nathan\u0027s mind. Very well, try your experiment. Get it over with. Actually, it has merit. It will save a lot of time if it works.\\n\\n There,\u0027 Nathan spoke to Atwei. \u0027He has nothing against it. And you needn\u0027t fear him for after all he\u0027s Thyre, one of your own. Also, Rogei\u0027s a dead creature and harmless.\u0027\\n\\n A dead \u0027man\u0027, Nathan, Rogei reminded. And not all dead things are harmless, believe me! Well, will she or won\u0027t she?\\n\\n \u0027Will you or won\u0027t you?\u0027 Nathan repeated him.\\n\\n \u0027If you wish it,\u0027 she said. She came round the table and he made to stand up. \u0027No, remain seated, and ... talk to this Rogei.\u0027 She placed a small, trembling hand on his brow.\\n\\n Atwei, 1 am Rogei the Ancient, once Rogei the elder. His mental voice was suddenly stern.\\n\\n She snatched back her hand and placed it on her breast. Nathan got to his feet. \u0027You heard him?\u0027\\n\\n Her mouth had fallen slightly open. She closed it, shook her head and said, \u0027No ... but I felt something. A presence!\u0027\\n\\n An echo, said Rogei. Atwei sensed the merest trace, the smallest ghost of me, amplified by your mind. It doesn\u0027t work, and I didn\u0027t think it would. You are the Necroscope, Nathan. Such talents are not commonplace.\\n\\n Soft, padding footsteps sounded from outside the room. Atwei backed shakily away, turned and went to meet the elders. Rogei read Nathan\u0027s concern and said, Well, too late or that now. We must deal with it as it comes. More ways than one to strip a cactus.\\n\\n The elders entered.\\n\\n There were five of them, not all \u0027old\u0027 by any means and certainly not decrepit. Nathan calculated their ages on what he knew of the elderly among his own people. The youngest of the five was possibly forty-five, while the oldest would be well into his seventies. Revise your estimates upwards by at least fifteen years, Rogei told him. The Thyre are long-lived. Since each colony has only jive elders, a man cannot even aspire to become one until he is at least sixty.\\n\\n Nathan looked openly, respectfully, at each of the elders in turn. The youngest of them was spindly and quite bald, but as yet largely unwrinkled. His eyes were somewhat smaller than those of his companions; their pupils were grey, dartingly alert and (Nathan felt sure) more than a little suspicious. Three of the remaining four were quite simply Thyre; dressed in knee-length, pleated, belted yellow skirts, apart from the difference in their ages there was nothing to distinguish one from the next. The final member of the group was the one anomaly: bearing a torque of gold around his neck, he was heavily wrinkled, bent, and wore flowing white hair to his shoulders. His eyes were huge, moist, and uniformly yellow as the gold of his torque. He was at a glance the Elder of elders.\\n\\n They peered at Nathan obliquely, blinkingly as they gathered to the table and their eyes adjusted to the extra light. Each carried a small stool, which they placed in a semicircle to enclose him. Then, straightening, they stood facing him.\\n\\n Atwei, standing behind them, said, \u0027Nathan, please sit.\u0027 And as he sat down, so did they. And without pause the interview and question session got underway.\\n\\n \u0027We shall dispense with formalities,\u0027 said the youngest of the five in a high-pitched, superior tone. \u0027You are after all Szgany and cannot know the ways of the Thyre.\u0027\\n\\n Excellent.\u0027 said Rogei. This spokesman thinks he knows it all, a common lailing among the young. So you must prove him wrong. Bow your head twice to him, then three times - but more slowly - to the Elder.\\n\\n Nathan did as Rogei instructed and the Thyre, including Atwei, sat up straighter. Then the five turned their heads to look at her, until she huskily protested, \u0027No, I have not instructed him!\u0027 In this way, and without saying a word, Nathan had their attention. But more than that, he had apparently earned himself the enmity of their spokesman.\\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 said that one, frowning, \u0027your telepathy is not as embryonic as we thought, for patently you stole this greeting from my mind. What is more, I failed to detect the theft! Yet in your fever these unseemly skills of yours were not obvious, which tends to show a naturally deceptive turn of mind.\u0027\\n\\n Rogei was quick off the mark. Point out how a man, even an elder, who jumps to concJusions to prove an elusive point may well deceive himself!\\n\\n Nathan did so, and added: \u0027One who investigates the mind of another while he is feverish risks discovering phantoms.\u0027\\n\\n At which point the Elder himself took over. In a voice which creaked like the branch of an old tree in the wind, he asked: \u0027And how many of these phantoms are there in your mind, Nathan of the Szgany?\u0027\\n\\n A great many, Rogei whispered in his inner ear, speaking now as Nathan himself. Some of them are the ghosts of my past, which are mine alone to reveal or hold at bay as I see jit. But there are also the voices of an hundred Ancients of the Thyre, who would gladly speak through me to prove my innocence - if the Elder of elders so desires.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Nathan repeated it.\\n\\n \u0027That is a blasphemy!\u0027 the spokesman made to stand up, but the Elder took his arm and held him down. The spokesman glanced at the venerable one and frowned, saying, \u0027But plainly he is a necromancer! He entered the Cavern of the Ancients in order to molest and torture our dead for their secrets!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If so,\u0027 the Elder nodded, patiently, \u0027the more we let him speak the more his words will condemn him. So far he is correct in one respect at least: namely that some are too quick to jump to conclusions! Let him say on.\u0027 And again he turned his great soft eyes on Nathan.\\n\\n Tell them your story in brief, said Rogei, while I spy on them through your eyes.\\n\\n Nathan complied. The Wamphyri have returned to Starside where they inhabit the last aerie. They raided Settlement, my home in the west of Sunside. During the raid, my mother and ....nd a Szgany girl were stolen and my brother went missing. Searching for him, I followed his trail east where I met a band of Travellers and determined to join them. But first I had to try one last time to find my brother. Finally, learning that he was dead, I tracked my Traveller friends to their camp at the edge of the grasslands and discovered that they were -\u0027 He paused and shook his head. \u0027- They were no more. The Wamphyri ...\u0027 He hung his head for a moment to drive out the memories of these very real phantoms, then looked up.\\n\\n \u0027I had nothing left in the world, and no longer wished to live. But remembering how I sometimes overhear the dead whispering in their graves - a strange gift, I know, and one which I had kept hidden - I thought that I might join them in death. Perhaps then I would be able to talk to my mother again, to my brother, my girl. Wandering beneath the stars, I crossed the grasslands into the desert, where sunup found me at the foot of sandstone cliffs. There I decided to die.\\n\\n \u0027But as I lay down to sleep I heard the voice of a man, an Ancient of the Thyre, who called himself Rogei. He told me certain things, led me to the Cavern of the Ancients. By then I was weak and fell unconscious. I woke up and was here. And now I\u0027m accused of desecration and blasphemy.1\\n\\n The elder spokesman was angry again. \u0027Despite that Rogei is a revered name among the Thyre, it is not uncommon. There is more than one Rogei in the Cavern of the Elders, as this Szgany necromancer guessed there would be. He must have learned the name from our traders, and remembered it to put to evil use.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How so?\u0027 The Elder looked at him. \u0027Who among the Thyre would reveal his secret name to a Szgany youth met briefly at the trading? For what good purpose? No, I think not.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Also, if it were so, does it mean you have changed your accusation? If so, then what is this man\u0027s crime? Is he a vile necromancer or merely a clever liar?\u0027\\n\\n The other pursed his lips. \u0027I say we should speak in our own tongue,\u0027 he said sharply. \u0027He listens; he is intelligent; he is a talented deceiver!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I say again: you deceive yourself,\u0027 Rogei prompted Nathan into speech. \u0027I can prove what I\u0027ve said.\u0027\\n\\n Then do so,\u0027 the spokesman snapped, \u0027and so condemn yourself!\u0027\\n\\n I do believe I know this one, Rogei spoke to Nathan. Yes, and also the Elder. Even under the trappings of his great age, still I know him. But the Spokesman: he has the looks and mannerisms of my own son. Why, it could be that he is my grandson! It would explain his vehemence, which is rare among the Thyre. Don\u0027t you see? He believes you interfered with the remains of his grandfather\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027But I didn\u0027t!\u0027 Nathan burst out - and the Thyre elders drew back a little on their stools, staring at him curiously.\\n\\n No, but I did touch you.\u0027 No dream, Nathan. You are the Necroscope which I named you, beloved of the dead. In the Cavern of the Ancients, when I thought you were about to die, I was - moved - to come to you! And rising up, I was beside you, to comfort you in your fever!\\n\\n \u0027You ... came to me?\u0027 Nathan wasn\u0027t able to hold back from blurting it out loud. \u0027But you\u0027re a dead man!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hah! He speaks nonsense!\u0027 The spokesman sneered, and went on to add some choice invectives in the Thyre tongue. But the Elder had read something in Nathan\u0027s strange eyes, causing him to caution his chief accuser:\\n\\n \u0027No, make yourself understood to him also. For if we desire to bring charges, he must have the benefit of the doubt.\u0027\\n\\n Rogei came to Nathan\u0027s rescue, telling him what to say and how he must say it. And looking at the Thyre spokesman he repeated Rogei word for word, faithfully, only leaving out his acid sarcasm. \u0027Ah, but your grandfather recognizes you at last, Pe-tey-is!\u0027 he said, gazing directly into the spokesman\u0027s eyes and nodding slowly. \u0027Petals, son of Ekhou and grandson of Rogei the Ancient, born in that same hour that your grandfather took to his sickbed. But before he died he saw you in your mother\u0027s arms and was proud of you, just as he is proud now to see that you\u0027re an elder! Rogei knows you not only from your premature loss of hair, familiar features and bearing in general - which is to say, moulded in an almost exact likeness of your father, his son - but also from your abrupt mannerisms and the heat of your argument. As Ekhou was ever the fiery one, so are you!\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Petais\u0027s mouth had fallen open. He couldn\u0027t speak and so gurgled a little, his eyes bulging. Under Rogei\u0027s expert guidance, Nathan gave him no time to recover but carried on. \u0027Now tell your grandsire, do you accept that these are his words? I hope so, for if not we must summon Ekhou your father and Amlya your mother, who will know me better. I know that they are not dead, for if they were I would have spoken to them in the Cavern of the Ancients!\u0027\\n\\n Petais shook his head wildly, stood up, sat down again. He was still lost for words. But the Elder of elders was not. \u0027Who is it speaks, you or Rogei?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little of both,\u0027 Nathan answered. \u0027I repeat his words, faithfully if I can.\u0027\\n\\n The Elder nodded, reached out a trembling hand to touch Nathan\u0027s arm. \u0027I perceive that it is true,\u0027 he said, his eyes rapt on him and unblinking. \u0027Plainly a great wonder has come among us!\u0027\\n\\n Petais groaned and said, \u0027Still we must be sure!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am sure,\u0027 the Elder answered him. \u0027You do not remember, Petals - of course not, for you were a child newborn - but I too was there when your mother took you before the dying Rogei, and indeed he was proud of you. I know, for I was Rogei\u0027s nephew, the son of his brother!\u0027\\n\\n Nodding, Petais seemed to sag a little. \u0027What must be must be. But it had to be decided, one way or the other.\u0027\\n\\n I was right, Nathan, Rogei sighed. The Elder is my nephew, Oltae!\\n\\n Even as he spoke his ethereal words, the one he had named turned from Petais to Nathan. \u0027I know you will understand that Petais is correct,\u0027 the Elder said. \u0027We had to be sure. Even now, we must be sure.\u0027\\n\\n Test me however you will, Oltae,\u0027 Nathan told him.\\n\\n The Elder gasped, gave a small start, and his hand tightened on Nathan\u0027s arm. \u0027That is my name, aye,\u0027 he nodded. \u0027And I know you did not steal it from my mind, for I have built a wall there which is impenetrable! Wherefore, one final test, and I shall be satisfied.\u0027\\n\\n Rogei prompted Nathan to say: \u0027Now I speak as Rogei. Let me guess this test, nephew. Has it to do with your examination for a place among The Five? You were a young man then, as Petais is now, but I remember your examination well for I was your examiner! I had many questions for you, but your answer to one of them won exceptional marks! Do you remember it, Oltae?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do indeed,\u0027 the Elder whispered.\\n\\n \u0027And I asked,\u0027 Rogei spoke through Nathan, \u0027\"When will we know if The One Who Listens exists?\" And you answered -\u0027\\n\\n \u0027- My answer was this,\u0027 Oltae the Elder cut him short. \u0027 \"We shall know that He exists when finally He speaks, which will not be until we are better capable of knowing and understanding Him.\u0027\" And as he gazed deep into Nathan\u0027s eyes, for a moment Oltae thought he saw an image of Rogei looking back at him, smiling. But as the Necroscope blinked, it was gone.\\n\\n The Elder sighed, nodded in his fashion, and creaked to his feet; likewise his four colleagues. But before they left, Oltae said to Nathan (also to Rogei): \u0027It is my thought that today, perhaps we are one step closer to understanding Him!\u0027\\n\\n And then to Nathan alone: \u0027Rest, get back your strength. We shall talk again ...\u0027\\n\\n In the long days which followed - days which would each have been as long as a \u0027week\u0027 in the time-scale of Nathan\u0027s unknown hell-lander father - he learned a great many things and did a great deal of \u0027teaching\u0027. The Thyre called it teaching, anyway, though to Nathan it seemed he merely passed on the messages of the Ancients. But certainly the previously irretrievable knowledge of the dead was of enormous advantage to the living.\\n\\n Long sessions were spent with The Five in the Cavern of the Ancients, where Nathan\u0027s talent as a Necroscope was proved beyond any further doubt; and as the living of the Thyre warmed to him, so did the Ancients themselves. And just as Harry Keogh had been a lone, bravely flickering candle to the dead of a far distant world, so now his son became a light in the darkness of the Thyre beyond.\\n\\n Much like the Szgany, the Thyre had very little of true writing; rather than words, they used a system of complicated glyphs to illustrate whole ideas, so that a lot of the detail was inevitably lost. Most of their \u0027history\u0027 had come down to them in this way, and in the form of myths and legends passed mouth to mouth (or mind to mind), from generation to generation; out of which had sprung their art-form of storytelling. Foremost amongst makers of Thyre romance had been one Jhakae, dead for more than two hundred and eighty years. Now, through Nathan, Jhakae could relate all of his best stories, created for a limited audience of dead Ancients, and know that they would be passed down to thousands of the living.\\n\\n Nathan relayed tale after tale, each of them furiously scribbled down and recorded as best as possible in the Thyre glyphs: the Story of the Fox and the Kite, the Fable of the Gourd and the Granule, the Tale of Tiphue and the Dust-Devil. Twenty of them, then thirty, finally forty, and all jewels of Thyre fantasy. But Jhakae\u0027s latest and greatest tale, as yet unfinished, would be that of the Szgany Youth in the Cavern of the Ancients: a Parable. And so Nathan was honoured.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n In everything Nathan transcribed from death into life, and vice versa, he had the invaluable advice and assistance of Rogei. But such was the body of information to be passed on, the enormous bulk of questions from both sides, that priorities must be decided, time apportioned, and the practical take precedence over theoretical, philosophical, and theological subjects. Within the comparatively narrow confines of Thyre existence, all such subjects were limited forms anyway; far more important and immediately applicable were ideas and devices such as Shaeken\u0027s \u0027Water Ram\u0027, his \u0027Hydraulic Hoist\u0027 and \u0027Wheel of Irrigation\u0027.\\n\\n Shaeken was that Ancient whose name Rogei had mentioned at their first meeting, who once designed leather buckets for the drawing of water from the wells. Pursuing his obsession in death as in life, Shaeken had proceeded to far greater things; but even without the benefit of his genius, Nathan might have brought the principle of the water wheel to the Thyre. Desert folk, they had never journeyed beyond the grasslands to such townships as Twin Fords, and had not seen how the Szgany used the raw energies of the river to assist them in their work.\\n\\n But they were the Thyre; the better Nathan knew them the more he understood their pride; making nothing of his own (in any case limited) knowledge, he spent long hours with a graphite stylus and the skins of lizards stretched on frames, creating meticulous sketches of machines direct from Shaeken\u0027s mind. And joiners of wood and other artisans pored breathlessly over each drawing as it was completed, so that as his work progressed the principles were grasped and the first models began to be carved.\\n\\n There were times when Nathan grew tired but he made no complaint. His life had purpose; his mind was so occupied as to hold at bay all the mourning and miseries of his past; he had a deal more of respect from his new friends than his own had ever shown him. He was satisfied, or believed he was satisfied, for a while at least...\\n\\n He was pleased to perform personal favours. Rogei felt compelled to discover the fortunes of various kith and kin; Nathan stood in his debt and so made inquiries on his behalf; Rogei was enabled to \u0027speak\u0027 with those who were here, still alive. Others however had moved away, to far colonies beyond the range of Thyre dead-speak. For just like the telepathy of the living, that of the dead had its limitations, too. Many of the ones Rogei sought were dead in distant places, beyond his reach.\\n\\n Meanwhile Nathan\u0027s fame had spread abroad; Thyre from other colonies began to arrive at the Place-Under-the-Yellow-Cliffs, all bearing invitations from their elders. Invariably they would seek audience with Nathan and let it be known that he would always find a welcome should he ever decide to visit. He promised Rogei that if ever he accepted such an invitation, he\u0027d be sure to seek out his old friend\u0027s relatives en route, wherever his travels took him.\\n\\n But in the interim he worked ...\\n\\n With the exception of trivial items vetted out by Rogei, first Nathan satisfied all the personal queries of the dead in the Cavern of the Ancients, and of the colony\u0027s living alike, before setting to with a will. Then: He made known all of the gourmet Arxei\u0027s myriad secret recipes, which that one had never revealed in life; he delivered a formula of preservation from the mirror-polisher Annais, a vegetable varnish to protect the Thyre mirrors and keep them from tarnishing; he gave voice to the gardener Tharkel\u0027s conclusions on bees, pollination, and the keeping of hives. In life Tharkel had made an oasis with his own hands, which had failed only through the lack of an adequate water supply; since when he\u0027d planned bigger and better ones. Now, with the advent of Shaeken\u0027s Hydraulic Hoist, they could be real!\\n\\n Nathan did all of these things, and as the work gradually slackened off even found time for a little local travelling and studying among the Thyre. And since the elders did not consider it fitting that a person of Nathan\u0027s importance should concern himself with the basic requirements of life, Atwei became his aide among the living just as Rogei was his spokesman among the dead. Dealing with all mundane matters, she left Nathan free to explore the possibilities of his unique talent.\\n\\n In fact he was given too much freedom and failed to use it to his best advantage. For as the furious pace of his life slackened, so he allowed a host of dreams and memories of past, unbearable things to creep back in to plague him. He dreamed of Canker Canison\u0027s barking laugh as the loping dog-thing carried Misha away to the horror of some unthinkable future; and of his mother, a flame-eyed thrall in the service of a hideous vampire Lord; and of Nestor rotting in the river, a thing of weeds and sloughing grey flesh, dissolving into the mud. Nightmares such as these invariably brought Nathan gibbering awake, and Atwei would come running to comfort him . ..\\n\\n In black bowels of earth beneath the colony, where even the fishermen of the Thyre must cast their nets by flaring torchlight, Atwei showed Nathan a section of the Great Dark River and explained as best she could its source and destination.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n \u0027As Sunside\u0027s rains roll down off the barrier mountains,\u0027 she said, her husky whisper echoing into the darkness and back from unknown places, \u0027and as storm-clouds burst less frequently over the furnace desert itself, so great bodies of water find their way underground. Many major tributaries may be found in the west, and others to the east, between the desert and the mountains. And so the Great Dark River under the earth is the sump of the world!\\n\\n The hard bedrock of the underworld is tilted eastwards; likewise, naturally, the course of the river. Where the rocks are softest, the rain of centuries has formed many cavern systems. Of these, the safest and most suitable have become Thyre colonies. The underworld is as important to the Thyre as your forests are to you Szgany. Temperate, it provides shade from the sun in the heat of the long day, and is a refuge from the bitter chill of desert nights. We could not live without it, or without the river which is its dark lifeblood.\\n\\n \u0027During its life the river has carved wide ledges in the rock. Of these, the driest and safest are used as paths along which we may follow the water\u0027s course where it rushes through dark gullies. In parts the river is navigable over long miles, forming vast sunless lakes where the blind fishes swim; but in other places the way is tighter and the water roars furiously!\\n\\n \u0027As for its length: the river parallels the barrier mountains; it passes under the Great Red Waste, and meanders past a range of lesser mountains where dwell people much like yourself... or perhaps unlike yourself, for they give of their young to the Wamphyri. And so the river flows into the unknown. Some say it journeys to a sea far in the east, beyond the caverns of the necromancers; but this is rumour, because no one of the Thyre has ever been there.\u0027\\n\\n Nathan listened attentively to Atwei; he looked at the ledges carved by the river in the canyon walls of the channel through ages immemorial, at the blackly gurgling water flowing swiftly by, and the catches of the fishermen wriggling in their nets. And at one and the same time the river both repulsed and fascinated him. Merely to think of its sheer length was an awe-inspiring exercise in itself: more than three thousand miles of subterranean waterways, if Atwei was right, and Nathan was sure that she was. Why, Sunside\u0027s rivers were streams by comparison; the Great Dark River covered more miles than Nathan had seen in his entire life!\\n\\n And yet it wasn\u0027t so much the river\u0027s size as its course which most affected Nathan\u0027s imagination: a course that followed the mountains east into that region beyond the Great Red Waste where the Wamphyri held sway, out of which they had returned into Starside. And as the river was a road to the Thyre, which they might follow on foot and by boat, colony to colony for all its many leagues, so might Nathan follow it...\\n\\n Sunups came and went; Nathan\u0027s work in the Cavern of the Ancients neared completion; he told The Five that he planned to move on, and they swore him to secrecy. He promised that whatever the future held, he would never tell his brothers in the outside world what he had learned of the Thyre and their ways.\\n\\n In the meantime his nightmares had got no better; if anything they were worse. Over and over Nathan lived through the hell of that night and morning in Settlement, the time of the Wamphyri raid. Also, he was aware of time fleeting by, and wondered how Lardis and the Szgany Lidesci fared now. Often in the Cavern of the Ancients he would sense his wolves trying to contact him. But they were distant and he was shielded by massive walls of rock; and anyway, what would they have to say except - it seemed likely - things he did not wish to hear? For by now, surely the Wamphyri were mighty again, a plague throughout all of Sunside.\\n\\n Once (for once on his own), he fell asleep in the Cavern of the Ancients and dreamed that the numbers vortex waited for him. That mighty, bottomless whirlpool of figures tugged at him insistently; he felt that if only he knew the meaning of all of these rapidly mutating symbols . .. they could open up whole new worlds to him. Any world would be better than the one he\u0027d left behind, providing that it let him live among his own kind. And again he felt like a traitor who had turned tail and fled from his enemies, his friends, even from himself.\\n\\n And now he must flee again, put greater distance between himself and the past, go searching for some shadowy fulfilment just around the corner of tomorrow ...\\n\\n In the Cavern of the Ancients he said his farewells. The dead were silent for a while. They would miss him.\\n\\n But ... he might return, one day? He couldn\u0027t say for definite, but possibly. Well, they had had their fair share of him, and the dead of other places were eager to meet him.\\n\\n Nathan spoke to Shaeken. Working so much together, they had developed firm bonds, a warm friendship and understanding. And: \u0027In time, your works will be a blessing to the Thyre,\u0027 he told the great engineer.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n They were nothing without you, Nathan, the other was flattered. But in a moment, and much more seriously: Nathan, these numbers which plague your dreams .. .\\n\\n \u0027Oh? You\u0027ve been spying on me?\u0027 Nathan knew it wasn\u0027t so.\\n\\n Hardly that! We can\u0027t help it. After all, you are the Necroscope. But the numbers: I\u0027ve seen them, it\u0027s true. And as you know I have a small understanding of numbers.\\n\\n \u0027You understood the vortex?\u0027\\n\\n He sensed the shake of a head. Did I understand it? No. Was I afraid of it? Yes: even as a child fears the lightning! By comparison, my own calculations are ant tracks in the sand - quickly blown away - while yours are alive and work towards an end. And just as your deadspeak is unique among the living, so is the vortex yours alone. It is a part of you, Nathan! I\u0027m no philosopher; my thoughts are shallow, mechanical things; but I sense that if one day you should fathom it, then you will be that much closer to your destiny. In Open-to-the-Sky there was upon a time an elder who was a mathematician. He is dead now, but what is that for a barrier? Perhaps you should seek him out.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe I will.\u0027 Nathan was grateful. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-21.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \\n The vampires have been vanquished!
