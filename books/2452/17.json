{"id":80284,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Had he been a vampire, then? But if that were so, how may one of the undead return to human life? And why would he want to? And what of the people in the town down there, Twin Fords? How would they receive him if he werht\u0027 among them?\\n\\n He frowned, sat down in the long grasses of the slope and considered his position. He must be cautious; he must know himself, before he dared show himself to others. But where was his past? What had it been? If people asked him, what could he tell them? That he was the Lord Nestor of the Wamphyri? Hardly!\\n\\n Then, close by, a distraction: A rabbit, emerging from its hole, blinked pink eyes and turned twitching ears this way and that before hopping tentatively forward - and uttered a short shrill scream as a wire snare tightened around its neck! Then, triggered by the animal\u0027s sudden frenzy, the weighted branch of a sapling slipped its anchor, sprang erect and hauled the poor creature aloft to hang it.\\n\\n Now here at last was something that Nestor remembered and understood well enough: hunting and trapping. So what did it matter that the trap wasn\u0027t his; surely it would make good sense to satisfy his hunger here rather than in Twin Fords, whose people might well be suspicious of him?\\n\\n Just a few short paces away, Nestor had already noted the reflective glitter of a flinty outcrop weathering up out of the shallow soil. Using a fist-sized rock to knock a pair of good firestones free of the mass, now he gathered together the rabbit and the makings for a fire. And in a nest of tall boulders which provided him with shade and cover both, he set about to prepare his meal. If the smoke of his fire was seen from below, then he\u0027d probably be reckoned for just another lonely hunter having his breakfast up in the hills.\\n\\n But for some reason as yet unfathomed (perhaps it had to do with the many fires burning down there, the black smoke roiling, and a too-familiar stench carried up in the heat and the smoke?), Nestor fancied that the people of the town would have problems enough this morning, without worrying too much about him . ..\\n\\n Unknown to Nestor and fourteen miles due west of him where he cooked and ate his breakfast, his brother Nathan was striding out for Twin Fords. And in Settlement-\\n\\n - Nathan had been gone for well over an hour when Misha Zanesti came through the forest from the south and slipped into town through the South Gate. She was seen, recognized by a girl who had been posted to keep her eye on the gate, and her presence reported to Lardis Lidesci. Misha, too, would report to Lardis, but not until she\u0027d been home.\\n\\n And in her father\u0027s house ten seconds after she entered: Astonishment! Rejoicing! A great flood of laughter, questions, tears! The joyful madness (for Misha) of being whirled about, crushed, lifted off her feet, gazed upon! And for them the joy of whirling, crushing, gazing.\\n\\n Finally, they demanded to know what, how, where -everything.\\n\\n But she only wanted to know about her brother, and about Nathan. And then the sadness all over again -for her brother, Eugen, taken by the Wamphyri. As for Nathan: he had been here, yes. And her surviving brother, Nicolae, remembering Nathan\u0027s visit and how he\u0027d felt then, said: \u0027Misha, you should marry that one as soon as possible - even today!\u0027 And her father saying nothing, which meant that he agreed.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n By which time Lardis and Andrei Romani had come knocking at the door, and Varna Zanesti knew why; but so did Misha. For Nana Kiklu - who remembered what it had been like in the time of the Wamphyri, and how it must be again - had warned her it would be this way. So that Misha knew exactly how to handle it even if her father, the huge and tempestuous Varna, didn\u0027t. Neither him nor her brother Nicolae, who was the model of his father but on a younger, only slightly smaller scale. They let Lardis and Andrei in, but as soon as the door was closed:\\n\\n \u0027Lardis,\u0027 Varna rumbled, \u0027I\u0027m reunited with my daughter, as you see. But my emotions are in turmoil, and so I warn you: do nothing to further disturb them. As for Misha: you need only look at her to see that she is whole and well.\u0027 He stood like a rock - glowering, towering over Lardis - with his huge hands knotted at his sides.\\n\\n Varna was massive. But while he dwarfed most other men of the Szgany Lidesci, his size had its disadvantages: it left him slow-moving, lumbering. Black-browed, bearded, and barrel-chested: by virtue of his aspect and dimensions alone he might appear brutal. And he could be, if he or his were threatened. A very determined man, Varna (some might say pig-headed, but not to his face), whose remaining son was scarcely less massive, and no less resolute.\\n\\n And Nicolae, casually fitting a bolt to the groove in the tiller of his crossbow, said: \u0027Andrei Romani, you\u0027re my elder and I respect you. But if you\u0027re hunting for vampires, best go do it somewhere else. The girl is my sister.\u0027\\n\\n Before the others could so much as speak, Misha placed herself in the middle of the four men. And: \u0027Lardis, Andrei,\u0027 she said, \u0027you\u0027ve nothing to fear from me. And if I\u0027m to be examined, then do it here, now, in my own home, and be sure I\u0027ll understand. For just this morning both Nana Kiklu -\u0027 she paused briefly, looked at Lardis and smiled, \u0027- and your own wife, Lissa, have told me the way of it. And so I\u0027m ready.\u0027\\n\\n Suddenly Lardis felt weak at the knees; his mouth fell open and his dark eyes opened huge as saucers; ignoring Varna and Nicolae, he stumbled forward a pace and took the girl by the arms - as much to steady himself as to confine her. And scarcely breathing the words, he said, \u0027You ... you had this from Lissa? This morning?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, oh yes!\u0027 she answered. \u0027Where we waited for sunup near the place of the lepers!\u0027\\n\\n Lardis staggered again, clapped a hand to his forehead and cried: \u0027Ah! The leper colony! Of course - I remember - yes!\u0027\\n\\n For upon a time, some ten years ago, Lissa had accompanied him when he was out beating the bounds of his territory. They\u0027d camped a mile from the colony, and it had been then that he\u0027d told Lissa: \u0027In the old days, if we were in this vicinity when the night came down, we would always camp as close as possible to the place of the lepers. For there was one thing you could be sure of: that no Starside Lord would ever come a-hunting here! No, for leprosy strikes terror in their black hearts, and it\u0027s as much a plague to them as they are to us!\u0027\\n\\n And Lissa, by the mercy of her star, had remembered his words...\\n\\n \u0027Lardis,\u0027 Misha said, while still he sputtered and gaped, and before he could explode with all of his many questions, \u0027first look at this.\u0027 She split off a small piece of garlic, the Szgany kneblasch, from one of several cloves on a shelf over the fireplace. And popping it into her mouth, she began to chew. Then she pulled a wry face -but one which was normally wry - and swallowed. \u0027There,\u0027 she said, still grimacing. \u0027Now I won\u0027t be able to breathe on anyone for the rest of the day! But it\u0027s worth it. Now then, give me one of your silver bells.\u0027 He fumbled one out of his pocket and handed it over. Misha rubbed it between her palms, hung it for a moment from the golden ring in her left ear, pressed it to her cheek and finally kissed it.\\n\\n And giving him back his bell, she went to the door and threw it open. Daylight flooded in, turning her hair a shiny raven black as she stepped out into glaring morning sunlight. And whirling the skirts which Nana Kiklu had repaired for her during the long night, she said: \u0027Under all of this grime my colour is my own, Lardis, not the lifeless grey of a vampire. When I\u0027ve bathed myself - and how I need to! - then you\u0027ll see. But tell me: what do you think of this blouse I\u0027m wearing?\u0027\\n\\n He looked, and saw that it was one of Lissa\u0027s blouses; his own wife\u0027s design and stitching couldn\u0027t be mistaken. And finally he was convinced, which in any case he\u0027d wanted to be. \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 he drew her back inside the house. \u0027You had that from Lissa too, I know. But now ... now tell me about Jason!\u0027\\n\\n Misha looked at him. Lardis\u0027s face was alight with high expectations, but a shadow had moved across hers. Her father and brother knew that look; they made sure Lardis was seated, with Andrei close at hand, then went to stand quietly in a cool, shadowy corner. And:\\n\\n \u0027Lissa was hoping -\u0027 Misha began, stumblingly, \u0027- she was hoping that you - that you could tell her something.\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Lardis groaned and hung his head, but in another moment he lifted it and said: \u0027An hour ago I had no hope for either one of them, and now you tell me my wife is alive and well.\u0027 He glanced at her sharply. \u0027She ... she is well, isn\u0027t she?\u0027\\n\\n Misha nodded and answered, \u0027A few bumps and bruises, but that\u0027s all. She had a narrow squeak - so did we all - which I\u0027ll tell you about in a moment.\u0027\\n\\n Lardis sighed, and continued: \u0027And so there must be hope for my son, too. Yes, I\u0027m sure there is. But now tell the rest of it your way and in your own time, so that I may take it in. But tell all of it, and so make an end of my foolish, fumbling questions.\u0027\\n\\n She nodded, and began:\\n\\n \u0027Your place on the knoll was hit first. But Lissa had seen a mist on the hillsides. Dousing the lamps, she\u0027d gone out into the garden. It was a flyer which wrecked your cabin, Lardis. It came from the east, following the contours of the foothills, and settled on your house which collapsed under its weight. And riding the creature\u0027s back - a man!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wamphyri, aye,\u0027 Lardis growled. \u0027Or one of their lieutenants. I had thought that perhaps it was a warrior; but now, thinking back on it, the stench was not so great.\u0027 He nodded his head, indicating that Misha should go on.\\n\\n \u0027This man - this vampire - was tall and slender, with eyes tiny as jewels, deep-sunken in his face,\u0027 the girl continued. \u0027He was dressed all in black, with a black cape and boots. His skull was shaven, except for a topknot. He looked like a corpse, and yet was lively, sinuous as a snake. But for all that he was Wamphyri and powerful, he also seemed nervous, cautious, furtive. At least, this is how Lissa describes him.\u0027\\n\\n Lardis said nothing but thought: Gorvi the Guile? Possibly.\\n\\n \u0027Lissa had hidden herself in the trees behind the house,\u0027 Misha went on, \u0027from where she could watch what happened. That was a mistake, for the vampire sensed her there! And satisfied that there was no danger, he stood in the garden with his hands on his hips and sniffed Lissa out! She felt his hypnotic power in her mind, and knew that she\u0027d been discovered.\\n\\n \u0027She tried to make a run for it, past the vampire Lord to the steps cut in the steep side of the knoll. But he got in her way and showed her the killing gauntlet on his hand. And closing with her, he said: \"Where is your man? Where are your sons? Show me your daughters!\" He caught her up by the hair -\u0027 (Lardis almost started to his feet)\u0027- and then Jason was there!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jason!\u0027 the word burst from Lardis\u0027s lips.\\n\\n \u0027He had come up from Settlement,\u0027 Misha was breathless, \u0027to discover this creature threatening his mother. Crying out his rage, without pause he hurled himself at the vampire. Distracted, the monster released Lissa, turned on Jason and struck at him with his gauntlet. Ducking the blow, Jason stabbed the other with his knife, whose silver blade glanced off the vampire\u0027s ribs, tore along his forearm and caught in his gauntlet, which Jason wrenched from his hand. And Jason\u0027s knife was red with the vampire\u0027s blood!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What then?\u0027 Lardis couldn\u0027t contain himself.\\n\\n \u0027Lissa saw your hatchet in a tree stump ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My axe?\u0027 Lardis cut in again. \u0027No other axe like it in the world - and I left it in the garden? To the rain and the rust? Just see how lax I had become! Jazz Simmons gave me that axe; he brought it with him from the hell-lands, and for nine hundred sunups it kept its edge! But go on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She worked the hatchet out of the stump,\u0027 Misha continued, \u0027and went to leap on the vampire Lord where he clutched his side and arm. He saw how keen was the weapon\u0027s edge, and knew that even in a woman\u0027s hands it could take his head. And both Lissa and Jason together, they were intent upon killing him! Well, perhaps he\u0027s a coward, this one -\u0027\\n\\n They all are!\u0027 Lardis cried.\\n\\n \u0027- But he fled before them, snatching up his bloodied gauntlet as he went. And as he got behind his flyer where it wallowed in the ruins of your cabin, Lissa heard him cry out: \"Roll on them! Crush them!\"\\n\\n \u0027The creature made to thrust itself upon them; they ran in different directions; Lissa was struck by the flyer\u0027s wing and knocked over the knoll\u0027s steepest rim! And... and that was the last she saw of Jason. Then: she fell through the brambles, bracken, saplings of the hillside, tumbling most of the way to the bottom. Her clothes were torn - you see how this blouse is stitched, here and here? - and so were her hands and arms, but not seriously. And when she came to rest, then she would climb to the top again!\u0027\\n\\n Lardis groaned and clutched his head. \u0027What a fool of a women I married,\u0027 he said. And then, with pride: \u0027But what a woman!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hear me out,\u0027 Misha told him. \u0027She would have climbed back to the top - to be with her son and help him fight the vampire Lord - but missed her footing and went plunging the rest of the way to the bottom! Then, shocked out of her wits, half-stunned, she made for Settlement where she hoped to find you and tell you what had happened. But at the North Gate ... she saw the town was burning, saw what was loose and ravaging in its streets.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n \u0027Weak now and terrified, hoping to find a place to hide, Lissa went into the forest and skirted Settlement to the west. And that was where she bumped into Nana Kiklu. Nana had hidden in the woods after her house was wrecked, but when things had seemed to quiet down a little she\u0027d gone back in through a gap in the stockade to look for her sons. Instead of finding them, she found me. And so I have Nana to thank for my life.\\n\\n \u0027She dragged me out of there and brought me round, and as I regained consciousness . .. that was when Lissa came stumbling and crying through the night. Nana calmed her, and then would have returned again into Settlement. But by then there were monsters everywhere. Their roaring, and all the screaming ... it was terrible. And Lissa and I, we couldn\u0027t be left alone. We ... we were no longer capable. I feel so ashamed - of my own weakness!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve nothing to be ashamed of, daughter,\u0027 Varna Zanesti rumbled, but with a catch in his voice. He came forward to put his arms round her and glower at Lardis. And: These women,\u0027 he growled. \u0027Why, they put the rest of us to shame!\u0027\\n\\n Lardis nodded, but neither he nor Varna knew how true it was; especially in Misha\u0027s case. For she had avoided explaining a single detail of why she\u0027d been so close to Nana Kiklu\u0027s house in the first place. And so like Nathan before her, she\u0027d covered up for Nestor\u0027s shameful lapse. But now:\\n\\n \u0027I have to know,\u0027 she said, eagerly. \u0027Where is Nathan?\\n\\n I would have expected him here by now ... oh!\u0027 And to cover her immediate embarrassment: \u0027Oh, and Nestor, too, of course! Nana is eager for news of both of them, naturally.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aye, \"naturally\",\u0027 her father repeated knowingly -and in the next moment fell deathly silent. For he remembered now about Nathan\u0027s brother. And poor Nana Kiklu, after all she had done and been through: still at the leper colony, knowing nothing about her son taken by the Wamphyri.\\n\\n Then, low-voiced, Lardis told Misha about Nestor, and went on to explain Nathan\u0027s absence: how Nathan believed that the flyer which took Nestor might have crashed to earth somewhere in the east, and had gone to see if he could find him there. Misha was sad to have missed him, but at the same time felt glad that he had forgiven Nestor. For after all, nothing had come of that one\u0027s bad behaviour in the end. And if Nestor still lived, perhaps all this would serve to reunite them.\\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 she said, when Lardis was done, \u0027Nathan will be back, won\u0027t he? I mean, whether he finds Nestor or not... Nathan will return?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of his own free will?\u0027 Lardis shrugged. \u0027Immediately? I can\u0027t promise it. Oh, I want him to come back - and so do you, I know - but Misha, he thinks that you, too, have been stolen away! So what is there here for Nathan now?\u0027 And there followed more explanations: how the last time Nathan had seen her, Misha had been in the grip of a slavering, hunch-shouldered Wamphyri hybrid.\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 her hand flew to her mouth. And: \u0027But Nana saw that creature too!\u0027 she gasped. \u0027She had just returned to the gap in the stockade fence, and saw the dog-thing drop me to go loping off after some poor screaming woman. But that means ... Nathan was right there, just a few paces away!\u0027\\n\\n Lardis nodded. \u0027Crumpled in the grass at the foot of the fence, aye. If Nana Kiklu had known where to look, she might even have seen him there. But with the vampire mist and what all - everything that was happening - and you and Lissa to care for ...\u0027\\n\\n Misha\u0027s eyes were wide; she made an instinctive, almost involuntary move for the door. Her intention was all too obvious, but her father stood in the way. \u0027No!\u0027 he said. \u0027I forbid it! The old Szgany trails where they skirt the foothills are no safe place for a girl even at the best of times. But now? Why, there\u0027ll be changeling people hiding in the thickets and caves, trapped by the sun as they headed for Starside. And there are bound to be vengeful men out hunting them! I\u0027ll not lose you a second time, Misha.\u0027 He turned to his son. \u0027But Nicolae ...?\u0027\\n\\n It was Lardis\u0027s turn to object. \u0027What, and am I still the leader of my people, or has Varna Zanesti taken my place, to do my work and my thinking for me? Well, and you\u0027re a fine strong man and all, Varna - likewise your son - but no one would call Nicolae fleet of foot! Anyway, you\u0027ve both of you mourned enough and now have reason to rejoice. And while I am still the leader, I won\u0027t have you split up again. Finally, I need both of you, indeed all three of you, right here in Settlement. What? But there\u0027s work to be done! On the other hand, I do have a number of runners to choose from, who\u0027ll be after Nathan in a flash.\u0027 Turning to Andrei Romani, he nodded. \u0027See to it.\u0027\\n\\n As Andrei went off in great haste, Lardis spoke again to Misha. \u0027I love Nathan Kiklu like a son, and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more to him than he\u0027s been given credit for. Will you and he get together now?\u0027\\n\\n She looked at her father and Varna shrugged. \u0027The choice is yours, daughter. But it\u0027s true the lad came looking for you, and I have to admit, he seemed a likely son-in-law to me.\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Nicolae nodded, and added: Til have him for a brother, certainly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good!\u0027 Lardis clasped Varna\u0027s broad forearm.\\n\\n Then: It was as if the old Lidesci had woken up from a nightmare. He straightened up and squared his shoulders, as if to throw off some great invisible weight, and to Varna and Nicolae said: They could use your help repairing the stockade, for it\u0027s heavy work. And then the great catapults and crossbows need bringing up to scratch. Also, Dimi Petrescu is convinced he can duplicate the black, explosive powder from The Dweller\u0027s shells and grenades. Old Dimi\u0027s been working at it for eighteen years, on and off, but he\u0027s very weary now and needs the strength of others to make purest charcoal, break rocks, and grind sulphur and iron into dust.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \u0027So ... it\u0027s a long day ahead, lads, but you can\u0027t say it hasn\u0027t started well enough. All we have to do is keep it rolling, right?\u0027 And to Misha:\\n\\n \u0027Girl, the way I see it you\u0027ve done more than your fair share already. Yet now I\u0027ll ask you to do one more thing. If I get a couple or three likely lads together and arm them, can you lead them back to the leper colony, and so bring Lissa and Nana Kiklu safely home? I ask this of you, Misha, in order to save time. You know the whole story, you\u0027re sympathetic, and so the women will have word of their sons from another woman. What do you say?\u0027\\n\\n And as he\u0027d known she would, Misha nodded and said, \u0027Just bring me my escort, and I\u0027m ready ...\u0027\\n\\n Within the half-hour she was on her way back through the woods with Lardis\u0027s \u0027likely lads\u0027: three tried and trusted friends. The way was fairly easy going; as the crow flies it was maybe seven miles, nine if you counted the winding trail. Misha knew all the shortcuts, however, and also the shallow fording places across the many streams. Last night in the darkness, with only star- and occasional moonlight to see by, Nana Kiklu had provided the strength and will, but Misha had been their guide.\\n\\n Then it had taken five hours; now, as she\u0027d already discovered, it would take less than two and a half to retrace her steps. By then, too, Lardis\u0027s runner should be catching up with Nathan on the approaches to Twin Fords. Such was the span of Sunside\u0027s day - more than one hundred and twenty hours - that with luck the two should be together again a third of the way through the morning. By then she would be very tired, but for now thoughts of Nathan sped Misha on her way.\\n\\n While at the leper colony: Nana and Lissa were camped less than a hundred yards from the colony proper, at the edge of the forest where it gave way to rolling savannah, then scrub, and finally the mainly uninhabitable desert wastes known collectively as the Furnace Lands. Out there, only ten to fifteen miles south of the leper colony, there was nothing much worth mentioning: sand, scorched earth, rockpiles; snakes, scorpions, and other poisonous creatures; a scattered handful of aborigine tribes. Of the latter: In the old days when the Szgany had been true Travellers, these primitive desert nomads - who seemed no further advanced along the evolutionary trail than Star-side\u0027s trogs - had sometimes bartered with men. They would meet at high sunup, in the dry savannah margins between desert and forest, to trade fancy lizard leathers and healing salts for Szgany knives and knick-knacks, wines, gourds and garlic. And now, here at the rim of Lidesci territory, the nomads traded just as in the old days; except now they traded with the lepers. Nana Kiklu knew this for a fact; for, far out on the savannah, she\u0027d noticed a tall springy pole with a fluttering rag pennant, like a fly on the face of the sun.\\n\\n As a girl, travelling with a small tribe, she\u0027d seen just such markers before and knew that the listlessly flapping pennant indicated a nomad trading place. She supposed it was just as well that the lepers had some sort of trade, even with the mysterious, little known or understood nomads; for certainly the bulk of the Szgany weren\u0027t likely to come too close. No, for leprosy was as contagious among them as it was among the Wamphyri.\\n\\n Not that the colony had been entirely abandoned by the Szgany Lidesci. On the contrary: it had been Lardis\u0027s father who conceived of it and built the first nucleus of airy lodges under the trees at the forest\u0027s edge. As to how that had come about: Twenty-four years ago a good friend of the elder Lidesci had contracted the disease. Before the affliction made itself obvious, it had been passed on to every member of his family. In those days - in that earlier period of Wamphyri domination - the old ways had been simple and hard: such sufferers were usually banished out of camp to wander alone until they died, on penalty of an even swifter death if they should ever try to come back. Some tribes had even been known to put lepers down out of hand. But Lardis\u0027s father wasn\u0027t able to do that, and so instead he built the leper colony here at the rim of Szgany territory to house the family of his friend.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Later, hearing about the place, other lepers had made their way here from the wilderness and from various tribes, and so the colony was established. And seven years later as Settlement had grown up and prospered, it had been a younger Lidesci, Lardis himself, who had continued to send supplies to the colony on a regular basis, so helping those who were mainly incapable of helping themselves. And even though in those early years the Szgany Lidesci rarely had a surplus of anything, still there was always enough to give a little to the lepers.\\n\\n Now it was the turn of the lepers to give in return...\\n\\n These were Nana Kiklu\u0027s thoughts where she stood in the shade of a tree at the forest\u0027s very edge, and thought back on the events of last night. Not on the painful scenes - such as the destruction of her house, and the fact that she\u0027d not been able to return and search for Nathan and Nestor, which had left such an ache in her heart that it would not be driven out until she and her boys were reunited - but on her exhausted arrival here at the colony. Exhausted, yes, for she and Misha Zanesti between them had been mainly responsible for getting Lissa Lidesci here safe and sound. Poor Lissa, cut by thorn and thicket, and very nearly insane from what she\u0027d seen and been through.\\n\\n And yet while Nana had the strength both physical and mental, it had been Lissa who was wise enough to advise their coming here, and Misha who was artful enough to lead the way. Misha Zanesti, to whom as a child the forest had been a vast and glorious playground. So all three had played their parts, until at last the woods were behind them and they came upon the savannah by moonlight.\\n\\n Then, too, Misha had known or divined the way; studying the stars and stating her belief that they had strayed too far west, she had led her companions in the other direction, along the edge of the rolling grassland. Until finally, in the lee of great trees which stood like sentinels looking out towards the inhospitable deserts, they\u0027d seen the soft glow of lamplight and knew that this must be the colony.\\n\\n Then there had been a low wooden fence, a robed and hooded watcher at the gate, holding up his lamp, and the hoarsely whispered, mumbled query: \u0027Who comes? Are you lepers?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not lepers,\u0027 Nana had answered, turning her eyes from the lamp\u0027s bright glare, \u0027but friends of those that live here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not lepers?\u0027 the other shrank back. Then go away -and go quickly! For we lepers have no friends. And it\u0027s not so much that we live here, as that this is where we come to die ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No friends?\u0027 Now Lissa had found voice to speak up. \u0027Not even Lardis Lidesci whose land this is, whose father built this place, and whose wife I am?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 the other hissed, and they caught a brief glimpse of his face where he held his lantern higher yet: the grey bone showing through his cheek, and the fretted gape of his nostrils. The Lidesci? His wife? But in the dead of night? And you -\u0027 he swung his light towards Misha, \u0027- only a girl, yet dishevelled, full of bruises, and your clothes all in tatters? And ... and ... the Lidesci\u0027s wife, you say?\u0027 He turned back to Lissa. \u0027But likewise wild and torn? Now say, what is this thing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Old man,\u0027 it was Misha\u0027s turn to speak, \u0027hard times have come, and we must spend the night here and wait for sunup.\u0027 And innocent, she reached out a hand to touch his sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 he said again, a gasp this time, and swiftly drew back out of reach. And: \u0027I am not... not old,\u0027 he shook his head, however slowly .. .\\n\\n But in the next moment, \u0027What hard times?\u0027\\n\\n The Wamphyri are back in Starside,\u0027 Nana told him then, breathlessly. \u0027And tonight they raided on Settlement!\u0027\\n\\n Finally they had made an impression. The Wamphyri!\u0027 the leper croaked, bobbing about in sudden agitation. \u0027What? They are back, did you say?\u0027 Abruptly he turned, hobbling off down a path towards the wooden buildings under the trees.\\n\\n \u0027Wait!\u0027 Misha called after him. \u0027We can\u0027t spend the night in the open!\u0027\\n\\n He glanced back. \u0027I only keep watch,\u0027 he husked. \u0027But we have a leader, too. Now wait here, and I\u0027ll bring him.\u0027\\n\\n In a little while he returned; several more lepers, all dressed alike, came with him. One of them was tall, shuffling, obviously in great pain. The sleeves of his robe seemed empty from the elbows down ... but his cowl was thrown back so that his face at least was visible and clean. He was pale, hollow-cheeked, with dark expressive eyes.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Uruk Piatra,\u0027 he told the women, looking at them. The others call me Uruk Long-life. And you ...\" He looked long and hard at Lissa - her oval face with its gentle almond eyes; her slim, long-limbed figure - and said, \u0027Yes, you are Lardis Lidesci\u0027s wife. You\u0027ve been here before, am I right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027With my husband,\u0027 she nodded. \u0027When he was beating the bounds. Twice, I think, but long ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aye, long ago,\u0027 the other agreed, \u0027when I had hands.\u0027 He looked at all of them again, blinking in the yellow light of the lanterns. \u0027But I\u0027ve been told a terrible thing: that the Wamphyri have returned to raid in Sunside!\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n By then Lissa had taken a firm grip on her nerves. \u0027It\u0027s true,\u0027 she told him, \u0027all horribly true! We\u0027ve come here from Settlement, which was burning when last we saw it. There were vampires in the streets, killing, raping, making thralls. But I remember that long ago, my husband told me that this was a place safe from all vampires. That\u0027s why we\u0027ve come here: to hide through the night from the Wamphyri, and to shelter from the forest and its beasts - till sunup at least, when we\u0027ll think what to do.\u0027\\n\\n The leper leader shook his head and his expression grew more haunted yet. \u0027A monstrous thing!\u0027 he said. \u0027But there are terrible things and terrible things. For a woman to fall into the hands of the Wamphyri would be a nightmare, I know, and to live with them even worse than dying. But to live here ... is a slow, lingering death in itself - which you risk just by being here.\u0027\\n\\n Nana Kiklu had had enough of this. \u0027So, we are turned away by lepers!\u0027 Her words were bitter. Then we\u0027ll sleep here, outside your gate. Only bring us clean blankets and a lantern, and we\u0027ll look after ourselves.\u0027\\n\\n Uruk Piatra looked at her and nodded slowly. \u0027Being what I am,\u0027 he said, \u0027does not make me any less the man. Upon a time I was Szgany, like you. Not a Lidesci, no, but I was a man. And even now I know my duty. I meant simply this: that I could not invite you in, for your own sakes. But certainly we can do better than blankets and a lamp! When lepers come here, we build them homes. Until they are built, however, a tent of skins must suffice. I suggest you pitch it under the trees, over there.\u0027\\n\\n Nana went to speak again, then hung her head.\\n\\n And again he nodded. \u0027It\u0027s all right. I understand. Only looking at you I can see how much you\u0027ve suffered.\u0027\\n\\n He gave orders and the other lepers went back to their sprawl of dwellings, returning in a while with a tent, blankets, vegetables, an iron pot and tripod. And: \u0027Stay here,\u0027 their leader told Nana, Lissa, and Misha,\\n\\n \u0027while they build your tent under the trees and light a small fire. Then you must make your own soup, with water from the stream there.\u0027\\n\\n And while their refuge from the night was put in order for them, so the three had told Uruk their entire story ...\\n\\n That was how it had been for them at the leper colony, in the early hours of the previous night. But as they had settled in to wait out the long hours of darkness, their worries were not so much for themselves as for their loved ones.\\n\\n Not unnaturally, Nana\u0027s thoughts had been for Nathan and Nestor: How had they fared through Settlement\u0027s devastation, she wondered? - wondered it in her sleep, and through all of her waking hours - till at last, still wondering, she\u0027d shivered awake with the dawn. Had it been just as bad for them? Surely it must have been even worse! And how were they faring now?\\n\\n Now in the light of early morning, in the foothills over Twin Fords, Nestor finished his rabbit and stretched out his limbs in the long grass to digest it. While behind him and somewhat higher, at the sheer, rearing rim of an outcrop, vile evaporation continued to spill out of the trees and tumble down the cliff like a frothing waterfall - but less vigorously now - from the three-quarters liquefied flyer destroyed by sunlight.\\n\\n As for Nathan ...\\n\\n Following old Traveller trails between the forest and the foothills, striding east towards Twin Fords, Nathan was tempted to seek out his brother in a way neither of them had used since childhood. It would mean breaking his easy, long-legged, mile-eating lope for a few minutes, which he was scarcely willing to do, but if it proved successful at least his mind would be at rest.\\n\\n For there had never been a time in Nathan\u0027s life when he was more aware that he was only one half of twins; when, as if to accentuate his and Nestor\u0027s physical differences, he could feel this new rift between them like a great canyon, yawning ever wider the closer he came to its rim. And he knew that Misha Zanesti had been only a part of it, that it had been coming anyway and she had been merely the catalyst.\\n\\n But it had all culminated so swiftly. First Misha: Because of her love for Nathan (rather, because of Nestor\u0027s jealousy), the brothers had drifted apart; that rivalry which had seeded itself in childhood had finally bloated into life, separating them. But they weren\u0027t the first brothers to come up against such a problem; it was something which might well have righted itself, eventually. Especially now that... now that Misha...\\n\\n But no, Nathan couldn\u0027t bring himself to dwell upon that - Misha with the dog-thing, Canker Canison - not in the way Vratza Wransthrall had so gleefully described it. And yet he must, for back in Settlement he\u0027d vowed against the Wamphyri, especially Canker. And though he felt choked inside, still a low growl escaped his throat as he pictured that one! Aye, and his vow was a double, even a triple vow, surely; for the Wamphyri were also responsible for whatever fate had befallen his mother, and for tearing him physically apart from his brother. As for the latter ... he could only hope that it wasn\u0027t permanent.\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n A terrible, terrible thing to have lost all of them: his mother, Misha, and Nestor. He neither knew nor wanted to know what effect the death of his brother would have on him, but he supposed it would be like losing an even bigger part of himself - perhaps the last part.\\n\\n For he and Nestor: they\u0027d shared their mother\u0027s womb, her milk, the love of the same Gypsy girl - though she\u0027d loved one as a brother and the other for himself. But their blood was one blood, and even their minds had seemed fashioned of like stuff; at least, they were similar enough that sometimes they touched upon each other.\\n\\n Which was what Nathan intended now: to touch Nestor\u0027s mind, and in so doing prove that he still lived. And if there was nothing there, a vacuum? That was the chance he must take: to be part of something which once was whole, at least, or to be even emptier than the husk he inhabited now.\\n\\n With all of these thoughts and others swirling in his head and clouding the psychic ether, it was hardly the best moment for such an experiment, but Nathan drew off from the trail anyway, sat down with his back to a boulder and closed out the day, his furious loathing of last night\u0027s raiders, all other emotions, everything, and let his mind drift...\\n\\n The dead drew back from him!\\n\\n He felt that at once; their shock, even their horror. But this time Nathan\u0027s interest Jay with the Jiving ... he hoped. And up in the high hiJJs, in deep caves, grey-furred ears sprang erect, grey heads were lifted, and triangle eyes blinked in gJoomy lairs. There were three of them, three together, who knew his mind as if it were one of theirs: Blaze, whose brow was marked with his mother\u0027s white; Grinner, whose damp bJack lips forever twitched, as if on the verge of smiling; Dock, whose tail had been shortened when he was a cub and wanted to play with some brave vixen\u0027s brood.\\n\\n They divined Nathan\u0027s purpose at once but couldn\u0027t help him, not this time. For none of theirs was abroad in the daylight, and no further reports of Nestor had reached them. If it were night, that might be different. But not now.\\n\\n Nathan acknowledged them anyway, where they whined a little, curJed up and resumed their contemplations. And moving on, he let his thoughts drift, drift. ..\\n\\n .. .Until they struck upon a mind he knew, yet at one and the same time did not know! For it seemed different, changed, wiped clean. Or perhaps wiped unclean, with a dirty, bloodstained rag? For this was Nestor, and yet it was not him.\\n\\n Nathan couldn\u0027t understand. It was as if Nestor\u0027s mind itself was undecided about his identity! And a great rage of pain and frustration, of need and ambition, and of loss and discovery seethed in the core of him!\\n\\n Such was Nathan\u0027s shock that he snatched himself back from the stranger which was his brother - and jerked erect where he sat with his back against the rock!\\n\\n And all of his thoughts fled back to him like whipped dogs, and his quandary was deeper than before where he took up the trail again and headed east...\\n\\n Nestor was asleep, digesting his meal, converting the strong food into energy. He was asleep and wandering in the most fragile of dreams - which were scattered on the instant that the alien Thing entered his mind!\\n\\n Alien, yes, and a hated enemy! He knew it from the whirlpool of numbers, symbols, meaningless equations and other mathematical devices behind which the Thing concealed its identity and purpose. That same enemy which had plagued him all the days of his life! Shivering despite that the sun blazed down on him, Nestor opened his eyes .,.\\n\\n .. .and looked up at two men, one about his own age and the other much older, who had come across him where he lay!\\n\\n The enemy of his dreams was at once forgotten; he saw the men - saw that just for the moment they were looking at each other, not at him - and closed his eyes again, feigning sleep. But what he\u0027d seen stayed etched on his mind\u0027s eye: One of them, the young one, was kneeling beside him with his fist knotted round the handle of a knife whose sharp blade gleamed like liquid silver in the sunlight. Slender, wide-eyed, nervous, he looked more than a little frightened. The other, a weathered, surly-looking man in his middle years, stood erect with a loaded crossbow held in his strong brown hands. He had been scowling and was now quietly muttering to himself:\\n\\n \u0027Steal a rabbit right out of my trap, would you, boy? And what are you doing up here anyway, eh? Especially this morning, after last night...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No vampire,\u0027 the one on his knees whispered, still glancing over his shoulder at the first speaker, \u0027else he wouldn\u0027t be out in the sun. And look at the state of him, all bruised and banged about! Was he a lone hunter, perhaps, scared down out of the mountains? What do you think, father?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do I think?\u0027 the first one\u0027s answer was a low rumble of unreasoning hatred and suspicion. \u0027Oh, I\u0027ll tell you what I think: that the bloodsucking bastards have thought up some new tricks, and that this one\u0027s some weird Wamphyri changeling! So he\u0027s not changed far enough yet that the sun will hurt him ... so what? You saw his flyer up there, all melting away, and its black bones poking through the rot. Too much of a coincidence to find a thing like that up there, and then to find this one down here. That\u0027s what I think!\u0027\\n\\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\\n\\n Nestor\u0027s flyer? He remembered it. Indeed, it was one of the very few things which he did remember. But what was that the older man had called him, a changeling? Hah! Little he knew. For Nestor was no mere thrall but a Lord! He was the Lord Nestor - of the Wamphyri!\\n\\n The word was like a fire in his blood - Wamphyri.\u0027\\n\\n And now he tensed himself - but carefully, guardedly - for action. His arms were folded comfortably on his chest, and one knee was bent a little. All to the good.\\n\\n \u0027So what do we do about him?\u0027 the one who kneeled wanted to know.\\n\\n \u0027First we wake him,\u0027 the other growled. And reluctantly: Then ... I suppose we\u0027d better drag him down into Twin Fords, and find out about him there. For I\u0027d hate to make a mistake.\u0027\\n\\n Too late! thought Nestor. You\u0027ve made too many already.\\n\\n He felt the younger one\u0027s hand grip his arm above the elbow, shaking him, and heard him bark: \u0027You, wake up!\u0027 Following which, all was a blur of motion.\\n\\n Nestor\u0027s eyes blazed open! Stiffening his hands and shooting them wide in a slicing motion, he knocked aside the young one\u0027s knife arm, simultaneously wrenching his hand from its hold on his right arm. Suddenly unbalanced, with his hands sliced out from under him, the youth could only topple forward. Grasping his advantage, Nestor slammed his bent knee into the other\u0027s groin, and jerked his head up off the ground to butt him full in the face.\\n\\n Lips which were already snarling their shock and terror split open bloodily; teeth and bone crunched sick-eningly; the youth\u0027s yelp of astonishment turned to a red gurgle as Nestor grabbed for the knife. He found it in the other\u0027s slackening fingers and gashed himself wrenching it free. But the slicing pain served only to galvanize him further.\\n\\n The older man was hopping left and right, trying to line up his weapon, shouting, \u0027Stab him! Kill the bastard!\u0027 He would get off a shot but his son was in the way, and what he couldn\u0027t see was that Nestor had the knife. And suddenly it seemed that the sprawling, jerking body of his son lifted itself up a foot from the one he was pinning down, and in mid-air shuddered convulsively. Then the youth was thrust aside, turned by Nestor\u0027s arm and knee, and his awful face was a bloody mask with a gasping hole for a mouth. Also bloody was the slit in his jacket, from which Nestor drew out the knife.\\n\\n \u0027Son!\u0027 With a cry of anguish, eyes popping, the father watched his son\u0027s brief death struggles, saw him flop motionless on the bloodstained grass. Then: \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-17.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \\n The vampires have been vanquished!
