{"id":80280,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"But in Twin Fords their arrival had not gone unnoticed: the rumble of warrior propulsors was unmistakable to certain of the older inhabitants, also the amorphous, squid-like silhouettes which blotted out the stars as they passed overhead, and the stench of exhaust gases which fell on the town like the smoke of a hundred corpse-fires. And a concerted sigh of horror went up and was passed on, swelling to a choking cry in the suddenly reeking twilight: Wamphyri! Wamphyri.\u0027 Issuing a clinging vampire mist as they advanced into the village, the raiders heard that massed cry -indeed, they felt the terror which their presence engendered - and laughed. They fed upon it, and with Wamphyri passions inflamed met the fleeing inhabitants head-on. The result was carnage. Wratha and her five were in the streets, blocking every exit as best they could. Human yet inhuman, they were simply figures in the stinking, slimy mist ... until the people who fled into their arms saw their eyes, their melting, changing faces, and the metamorphic poisons which dripped from their fangs! Wran raged, of course, but he also remembered Wratha\u0027s words and his fury was controlled. Having left his gauntlet tied to his saddle, instead he drove fingers like talons into the chests of his victims, nipping their hearts a little until they fell twitching to the ground. And kneeling, he would fasten his teeth in their necks to taste their blood, which served to transfuse his own blood\u0027s monstrous fever into them. So he dealt death and undeath to a score of victims in as many moments. And \u0027dying\u0027, they all sensed the instructions of Wran\u0027s hideous vampire mind, which spoke to them as one body although they were many: When you rise up and come to me in my manse in Starside, bring me your goods and chattels, which are now mine. Only remember: come before the sun is risen! For your Szgany flesh is as a soft metal beside the fire of the sun, and what has been forged may be melted. Aye, and what I have made can be unmade forever. Within the hour he killed sixty like this, men, women and youths, of which less than one third would make it to Starside. For before they could escape from the sun, first they must escape from the raid\u0027s survivors; and of course, there would be some who woke up too late, or not at all, but slept on with stakes in their hearts until they were burned. In its way, it was not unlike a process of natural - or unnatural - selection. Spiro\u0027s way was simpler than his brother\u0027s: he snatched up people where they fled through his mist and bit their faces, then struck them down with hands like hammers. Pain and shock did the rest. They would not die but wake up with sore heads and strange cravings, and hear the message which he\u0027d left in their changeling minds. As for Canker: to the terrified people streaming out of the stricken town, he must seem like a tame wolf who fled with them. But he was not a wolf and he was not tame. Loping among them on all fours, he chose only the fleetest, and for every male he chose a female. He was tempted . .. there were plump young beauties here... but like Wran the Rage, Canker, too, remembered Wratha\u0027s words. Why waste his energies now in the cold comfort of the streets, when he\u0027d be using all these women later in whichever way he chose and to his heart\u0027s content? -those of them who made it, anyway. His brand would be unmistakable when he saw it: they would be limping where he\u0027d savaged their legs to bring them down, and chewed a little in the junction of neck and shoulder. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Gorvi the Guile crouched in the arch of a mist-wreathed doorway, from where he called out softly, urgently to people rushing by: \u0027Quickly, there\u0027s safety within!\u0027 Upon entering, they stumbled over the sprawled heap formed of previous victims, saw the smoking blobs of sulphur which were his sunken eyes, and at the last felt the needles of his gleaming teeth. Vasagi the Suck waited around a corner, grabbed up any who passed too close, and stabbed them deep in their ears - even to their brains - with his darting, spurting proboscis. For Vasagi, all was accomplished in this one, simple, flowing action; if he desired it, his toll might be huge. But he did not. And his message to the undead was likewise simple: It was Vasagi the Suck who tasted your brains and bent them to his will. Report to me on Starside. You will know me by my face, which is unique. So the six and their shadowing lieutenants advanced into the town, leaving death and undeath in their wake. And each of them was like a plague in his own right, except Wratha. She wore her gauntlet, but only for protection. And killing no one, her method was the simplest of all. Stepping close on the heels of the others where they went, flitting from one to the next as they advanced, she would go to certain of their male victims and touch them, saying: I am Wratha. He who killed you is to me what you were to him: nothing! Where lore you are mine. When you come into Starside, be sure you come unto me. So she recruited her thralls, all of them men or youths. But still she did not see herself as a thief. No, for as the leader of the pack, in order to ensure that all went well for the rest of them, she needed her wits about her. Personally, she could not afford the additional distraction of the kill. Thus Wratha excused herself. And indeed all went very well, for a while ... ... Until the six and their lieutenants came together in an open space where the fires burned in the town\u0027s centre. And face to face, with the warrior stench fading and only their own mist draping them, victory shone from their redly luminous eyes. It had been almost too easy. It had been too easy! For suddenly, a voice from behind snarled: \u0027Murdering - bastard - things!\u0027 And human, Szgany, the voice itself was a threat. Whirling as one, falling to defensive half-crouches, the twelve turned outwards. Behind them in a ring, a dozen or more men of the village hemmed them in. But these were mature, experienced men: men of the old days. Their faces were filled with horror, hatred, and resolution; they carried crossbows, loaded and aimed. Wratha had half-expected it. Szgany herself upon a time, she knew there were always some who retaliated, who could not be crushed utterly: these people, for instance. In the old days this band - these wanderers, always on the move from place to place in their avoidance of Wamphyri raids - had not been supplicant; they\u0027d not surrendered easily to Wamphyri oppression but fought back. And these men ... they remembered how! Their bolts would be silver-tipped, steeped in kneblasch, deadly. There were long knives in their belts, and wooden stakes! And: Come! Wratha called to her warrior. But in that same moment, the men began firing. Wratha\u0027s lieutenant, a young man and very bloody, with a gauntlet which was clogged with red flesh (her restrictions had not applied to thrall watchdogs such as him), hurled himself in front of her - and took a bolt in his throat! He gagged, threw up his arms, was hurled back against her - to be grasped and held there by Wratha, as a shield. The other lieutenants had acted in a like fashion, three covering their masters, the others leaping head-on to confront the threat. Bolts took one of them in mid-flight, skewered him and stretched him out, but the other got in among the would-be avengers. He struck left and right, his gauntlet spraying red, until silver-edged swords hissed to cut him down. Vasagi the Suck\u0027s mental screech sawed at his colleagues\u0027 nerve-endings; he had been struck in the side, where his vampire flesh was now poisoned. A master of metamorphism, he would quickly shed the infected flesh and cure himself; but his cry served to galvanize his five Wamphyri colleagues to action. Until then they had been stunned and immobilized by the attack, even Wratha, for in Turgosheim\u0027s Sunside it would have been impossible. But now: \u0027Wran,\u0027 Wratha cried, \u0027now you may rage all you will!\u0027 Gorvi cursed where he issued a screening mist for all he was worth; Vasagi reeled and tore out the bolt from his side, hurling it down; the rest sprang to join their lieutenants in the fray. The men of the village were reloading. One of them got off a frantic, lucky shot which took Canker\u0027s lieutenant in the heart. In the next moment Canker was on the crossbowman, tearing out his throat... Wratha came face to face with a man just finished reloading who elevated his weapon point-blank against her breast. Even as he squeezed the trigger, her hand closed on the projecting head of the bolt. Ignoring the \u0027pain\u0027 of kneblasch and silver (she was partly immune, anyway), her fist clenched the bolt more tightly yet and her awesome vampire strength held it back. But the crossbow itself answered the laws of physics. Flying backwards, its thrumming wire sliced the man\u0027s windpipe like a razor, even as Wratha\u0027s gauntlet disembowelled him. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Gorvi\u0027s mist settled over everything, and Gorvi himself was central in it. His gauntlet turned one man\u0027s face to ruin, sheared through the rib-cage of another as if the bones were twigs. And the screams of the dead and dying were like music in the ears of the Wamphyri. Through all of this Wran raged, and likewise his brother Spiro. So that they were still raging as Gorvi\u0027s mist cleared and it became apparent that nothing more threatened. Distantly, briefly, there sounded the patter of flying feet, but that was all. The dead lay where they had fallen. As Wran and Spiro grew calm, so there sounded the stuttering throb of propulsors and Wratha\u0027s warrior, followed in short order by the others, began circling overhead. Gorvi the Guile looked from the warriors to the smoking red ruins of men where he stood among them, and said, wonderingly: \u0027So they did fight, after all...\u0027 And with a nod, Wratha answered, \u0027A handful of them, who remembered the Old Wamphyri. But we must never tolerate resistance.\u0027 They should pay for it!\u0027 Canker declared. \u0027Let\u0027s follow them, hunt them down!\u0027 Wratha looked at Vasagi and her face framed a question. His eyes were wide with fury where he stood holding his side, but he shook his head and glanced at his warrior spurting over the rooftops. He sent a message, and the beast at once crashed down on a huddle of dwellings, shattering them outwards! And: The Suck is right,\u0027 Wratha declared. \u0027Let the fools run and hide and think it over, and when they return discover the retribution of the Wamphyri!\u0027 Her creature likewise crashed down, with more sod and timber buildings disappearing into rubble, and Wran and Spiro\u0027s warrior followed suit. And leaving all of the monsters wallowing together in the town\u0027s debris, Wratha, her renegades, and their two remaining lieutenants returned to their flyers. Now the warriors would fuel themselves on the victims of the brief battle, human defenders and vampire lieutenants both. It should not occupy them for too long ... Later, airborne, Wratha said: All accomplished, except we\u0027ve lost four lieutenants and failed to recruit more. So, we have a choice. We can wait and make new lieutenants from our thralls when they come over into Starside, or... The others waited, and in a moment: Do you remember, she continued, I said that if all went well there might be a treat for you? They did, and she went on: Vasagi, are you up to it? With telepathic perceptions sharper than the others, the Suck knew her mind. And: Yes, he answered, as brief as ever. They rose up level with the peaks and Wratha pointed west. The night\u0027s still young, she said, and we have lieutenants to recruit. So let\u0027s see what else this marvellous Sunside has to offer, eh? No one disagreed. At about which time, and twenty miles away: The three more youthful members of Lardis Lidesci\u0027s party, returning home from their Starside trek, had gone on ahead into Settlement. But Lardis and Andrei Romani still had the better part of an hour to go before they in turn would enter through the town\u0027s East Gate ... Ill Something less than an hour later, in Settlement: Attracted by a sudden commotion and surge in the crowd, Nestor Kiklu made his way through the milling people to discover what was going on. And he saw that he\u0027d been right: it was Lardis Lidesci\u0027s voice making all the fuss. As for what it was all about: that remained to be discovered. At the forward edge of the crowd, where the people who had come out to welcome Lardis home now held themselves back, shocked by their leader\u0027s outburst, Nestor felt himself swaying with an unaccustomed dizziness. Complementing the natural excitement of the night - that and his passion of a minute or two earlier, when he\u0027d talked to Jason about Nathan and Misha - the Szgany wine was quickly going to his head. Reeling, he paused to lean against a cart, and became just one more slack-jawed witness in a sea of astonished faces. For there at one of the old decoys Lardis stomped about in the tired, broken-down framework of torn, weathered skins and rotting wooden ribs - and raved! Ever faithful, Andrei Romani followed on behind his leader, trying to calm him down and imploring the crowd to hold back and not concern themselves; the old Lidesci was just worn out from the trek. But to Nestor and the rest, Lardis looked far less tired than ... \u0027... Crazy!\u0027 some woman muttered, close by. \u0027He must have been drinking on the way in, and had a skinful. Why, listen to the man! Playing at being the Big Leader again, after so many years of doing nothing! What? But if his Lissa knew the state he was in, she\u0027d be down here boxing his ears by now! But no, they have their fine cabin up on the knoll, well away from us common folk.\u0027 Old bag! Nestor thought. He didn\u0027t think much of Lardis, but old sows like that were worse far. All the same, what on earth was Lardis up to? \u0027Lardis!\u0027 someone shouted from the crowd. \u0027Now what\u0027s all this about? Why, you sound like you\u0027ve lost fifteen years out of your life, and gone back to the bad old days! As for these lures and all such rubbish: we abandoned their upkeep a lifetime ago. They should be stripped down for firewood. So what\u0027s all the fuss?\u0027 \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Now Nestor began to understand, and to believe that maybe Lardis really was crazy; certainly he\u0027d been acting strangely since they came back through the pass. In order to get a better idea of what was going on, he pushed himself upright and moved closer still. Fuming and sputtering, with Andrei Romani still in tow, now Lardis stalked around the perimeter of the decoy. \u0027What?\u0027 he snarled. \u0027But look at the state of these lures! The skins are tattered and the timbers rotten. What could you impale on stakes as wormy as these? Nothing! They\u0027d crumble at a touch. As for a warrior impaling himself, ridiculous! What creature would ever feel challenged by ... by this mess?\u0027 \u0027Lardis,\u0027 Andrei tried to keep pace with him, catching at his arm to slow him down. He kept his voice low but still Nestor heard what he was saying. \u0027Lardis, you\u0027ll only excite the people, worry them, frighten them silly. Can\u0027t this keep, at least until you\u0027ve rested? You have no proof, after all. I mean, you\u0027re not sure, now are you?\u0027 Nestor\u0027s head felt light, even giddy. He wondered: proof of what? Not sure about what? Perhaps Lardis was tired after all - or sick, maybe? Even now he was looking at Andrei with burning eyes, turning his gaze on the muttering crowd, finally holding up a trembling hand to his sweating brow. But no, he wasn\u0027t sick, for in the next moment he was raving again. \u0027The stockade fence!\u0027 he shouted, heading in that direction. \u0027You\u0027ve cut doors in it, gates on all four sides. Except they\u0027ve stood open for so long that they\u0027re warped and won\u0027t close any more. And just look at the great crossbows and the catapults!\u0027 He went at a stumbling run, up the rickety wooden steps where they climbed the fence, to tug at the lashings of a catapult whose huge spoon of a head stood taller than his own. In a moment, rotten leather had fallen to mould in his powerful hands. Disgusted, Lardis let the dust trickle through his fingers and looked around. And his fevered eyes went at once to frayed hauling ropes where they dangled from the pivoting hurling-arm. Then, risking life and limb, he used these self-same ropes to slide back to earth. \u0027Oh, they take my weight, all right,\u0027 he panted, landing. \u0027But how do you think they\u0027d stand the strain of hauling that bucket down against its counterweight, eh? Well, I can tell you that for nothing: they wouldn\u0027t!\u0027 \u0027Lardis!\u0027 Now Andrei had stopped trying to reason with him, and his voice was suddenly harsher, angrier - sorrier? \u0027Man, I don\u0027t think you ... I mean, it seems to me that you\u0027re not ... that you\u0027re no longer responsible!\u0027 Lardis had meanwhile turned away to head for the South Gate. Still following him, Andrei cried out: \u0027Lardis, do you insist on being right? But man, you can\u0027t be! You mustn\u0027t be!\u0027 Sensing a drama, the crowd moved as one man to shadow the pair. But finally it seemed that something of Andrei\u0027s words had got through to Lardis. What? What was that he\u0027d said? That Lardis Lidesci was no longer responsible? Or did he simply mean sane? His footsteps faltered, stopped, and he turned. And as Andrei caught up and went to him, pleadingly now, so Lardis hit him once and stretched him out. Then he turned and went more quickly yet - but crookedly, brokenly - towards the South Gate and the forest beyond. And this time the crowd let him go. Nestor shook his head, partly in amazement and partly to clear it. The wine lay like a blanket in his brain and on his tongue. Alcohol: even as it deadened the senses and killed off common sense utterly, still it generated passion and excitement. Drunk, Nestor was excited about what had happened, which must surely signal the beginning of the end for Lardis Lidesci, his decline and fall - and the rise of his weakling son, Jason? And he was passionate about... ... \u0027Misha!\u0027 He spoke her name out loud, and turning bumped into someone. The other, a youth he knew, whose face was now a frowning blur, steadied him and said: \u0027Misha? I saw her earlier, heading for your mother\u0027s house, I think. But what do you reckon about -\u0027 But Nestor had no more time to waste here. Not waiting to hear the youth out, he thrust him aside and went stumbling in the direction of the houses huddled in the western quarter of the stockade, in the lee of the fence and the watchtower. One of those houses had been \u0027home\u0027 to him for as long as he could remember, but perhaps no more. And the strong wine churning in his stomach, and likewise the thoughts in his fuddled head: Misha at his mother\u0027s house ... And who else would be there? ... Why, none other than Nathan!... The two of them together, like lovers reunited after a long absence. Well, Nestor knew what he must do about that! With the murmur of the crowd fading behind him, he walked unsteadily through the empty streets of low cabins, store and barter-houses, stables, beehive granaries; and with every thudding beat of his heart his resolve grew stronger and his course seemed more clearly defined. If what he planned was a crime, at least it would be justified. To Nestor, at least. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" The west wall loomed, and there was Nana Kiklu\u0027s house, one of several built close to the fence: a long sloping roof of wooden shingles at the front, and a short one at the back, covering the stable and barn. Hanging open, the louvre-covers at the windows let out lamplight and the low murmur of voices. His mother\u0027s voice, Misha\u0027s tinkling laugh, and Nathan\u0027s stumbling stutter. Inside, all would be light and warmth. Perhaps wistfully, Nestor thought about that: all light and warmth ... but the narrow alley leading to the back of the house and the hay barn was as dark as his intentions. And suddenly he knew how dark they were; so that he might have gone straight to the door and entered, been one with the others, and woke up in the morning with a thick head, a sigh of relief and a clear conscience. But it was not to be, for at that precise moment he heard laughter and the door opened a crack, and he stepped back a pace into the shadows of the alley. Then Nestor heard his mother bidding Misha goodnight, the door closing, and the lingering footsteps of two people coming towards him as they made for Misha\u0027s house. And when they stepped into view, and paused silhouetted, her arm hugged Nathan\u0027s, and the starlight gleamed on her smile. And Nestor was cold as stone again, but the fire inside him raged up hot as hell. He felt his feet carrying him forward, had no control over them, or over the hand that made a fist and drove for Nathan\u0027s chin, striking him and rocking his head back against the wall. Misha had time for a single gasp as Nathan crumpled - time to stumble backwards, wide-eyed, away from his attacker, and gulp air to make a shout - which came out as a shocked exclamation as finally she recognized ... \u0027Nestor.\u0027?\u0027 And as her eyes went wider yet he grabbed her up, muffled her mouth with his hand, and dragged her kicking and biting - but all in silence - along the passage to the barn door, where he lifted the bar with his elbow. Inside, the piled hay made a musty-sweet smell, and the inky darkness was striped with starlight filtering faintly in through a loosely boarded side wall. Nestor was aroused now; with his free hand, he tore Misha\u0027s dress open down the front and fondled her firm breasts, and she felt him hard where he pressed himself to her. And the incredible became possible, even likely, as he half-pushed, half-fell with her on to the hay. Misha had always known Nestor was strong, but the strength she felt now was that of the rapist: mindless, brutal, fevered and phenomenal! His breath was hot and sweet with wine, his kisses rough and lusty, and his hands even more so where they alternated between squeezing her breasts and dragging her legs apart, positioning her on the hay. And to accompany every move, each panting breath, he tore at her clothing, and at his own. Now she fought him in earnest - raking his face, trying to butt him, bite him, bring her knee into his groin - all to no avail; in just a few seconds she was exhausted. Pinned down, breathless and gasping, her fate seemed certain. She drew air massively to scream, and Nestor brought his face down on hers, crushing her mouth. How she tossed and wriggled then, desperate to be rid of him as he threw her dress up over the lower part of her face ....nd a bar of starlight fell across her forehead and eyes. Seeing the fear in Misha\u0027s eyes, Nestor flinched inside, in his guts. Perhaps for her part she felt the change in him, which came and passed in a moment. And: \u0027Why?\u0027 she panted, as he completed the work on her underclothes. \u0027Nestor, why?\u0027 He began to come down on her, his hand behind and under her, opening her up. \u0027When your father and brothers know,\u0027 he husked, \u0027they\u0027ll either kill me or see to it that we\u0027re married. Whichever, it will be decisive.\u0027 His mouth closed on hers; she felt his manhood throbbing, thrusting, searching her out, and wondered: Married? Then why didn\u0027t you just ask me? For after all, she had always known it would be one of them, Nestor or Nathan. She hadn\u0027t known which one, that was all. Now she did, and it wasn\u0027t Nestor. But maybe she knew too late ... Nana Kiklu kneeled by her stone fireplace and chopped a few last vegetable ingredients into the stew bubbling in a copper pan. Her boys would be in soon, Nestor from the welcoming party and Nathan back from walking Misha home. They might have eaten already, but with their appetites it would make little difference. And home cooking was always best. Nana smiled as she thought of Misha: that girl was really smitten with her boys. But then, she always had been. Sooner or later she would make her choice, and Nana hoped ... but no, she must be impartial, and certainly she loved them both and had no favourite. But Nathan, Nathan ... The smile fell from her comely face, became a frown, and she sighed. If not Misha Zanesti, then who would take Nathan? And if it was him, then what of Nestor? For they had grown up together, all three, so that whichever way it went the choosing would be painful and the parting of the ways hard. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" And again Nana thought: Nathan, ah, Nathan! Misha understood him and his ways; something of them, anyway. And as for Nana: she, of course, understood them only too well! She need only look at him to see his father, Harry Keogh, called Dwellersire, looking back at her. Fortunate that no one had ever noticed or remarked upon it; but times had been hard in those days, when people had enough to do minding their own business without minding the business of others. And Nathan\u0027s differences hadn\u0027t become really marked until he was five, in the year after the last great battle, which had destroyed his alien father along with the first and last of the Wamphyri. On occasion, infrequently, Nana had seen Lardis Lid-esci look strangely, wonderingly at Nathan. But even if he suspected, Lardis would never say anything. He had always been the strong one, Lardis: the protector. And anyway, he got along well with Nathan and liked him; that is to say, he got on as well as could be expected with someone who kept so far apart. Nathan had always kept himself apart, yes, except from Misha, of course ... And now Nana was back to that. Finished with her vegetables, she sighed again, stood up, crossed to the window and looked out. Twilight was quickly fading into night now; the stars were very bright over the barrier range, and a mist was rolling down off the mountains and across the lower slopes. In the old days a mist like that would have sent shivers down Nana\u0027s spine, but no more. And her mind went back all of eighteen years and more to just such times -and one night in particular - in The Dweller\u0027s garden on Starside. What she had done then ... maybe it had been a mistake, maybe not, but her boys were the result and she wouldn\u0027t change that. Nestor and Nathan: they\u0027d never known their true father; which, considering what came later, was probably just as well. But for all that Harry had been (and must now forever remain) a stranger to them, the one unknown factor in their young lives, still he\u0027d left his mark on them, and especially on Nathan. Oh, Harry Dwellersire had marked both of her sons, Nana knew, but in Nathan it burned like a brand. Burned! She sniffed the air and went back to the fire. For that would never do, to let her good stew burn. But in the pot, the water was deep, simmering, not boiling over at all. And so the smell must be something else entirely. A smell at first, and now ... a sound, which Nana remembered. Impossible! She flew to the window. Out there, the mist was leprous white in moon- and starlight, undulating, thickly concentrated where it lay on the foothills and sent tendrils creeping over the north wall and through gaps in the stockade\u0027s inner planking. Nana had never seen a mist like it. No, she had, she had! But there are certain things you daren\u0027t recall, and this mist was one of them. The sound came again - a sputtering roar - and a shadow blotting out the stars where it passed overhead. And drifting down from the darkness and the night, that nameless reek, that stench from memory, that impossible smell. Utterly impossible! But if that were so ... ... Then what was the meaning of the sudden, near - distant tumult which Nana now heard rising out of the town? What was all that shouting? What were those hoarse, terrified, Szgany voices screaming? No need to ask, for she knew the answer well enough. \u0027Wamphyri! Wamphyri!\u0027 And as the throbbing sputter of propulsors sounded again, closer, shaking the house, the one thought in Nana\u0027s mind was for her boys and the girl they loved: Nathan! Nestor! Misha! She ran to the door and threw it open. Nathan! Nestor! Misha! The bellowing of warriors seemed to sound from every quarter, and the sickening stench of their exhaust vapours touched and tainted everything. Nathan! Nestor! Misha! Something unbelievable, monstrous, armoured, fell out of the sky, directly on to Nana\u0027s house. Along with the adjacent houses, her place collapsed into dust, debris, ruins, like a ripe puffball when you step on it. Shattered, the door flew from its leather hinges and knocked Nana down in the billowing dust of the street. But even as she dragged herself away from the hissing and the bellowing - and now the screaming, which rose up out of the smoking rubble of the nearby buildings -still she repeated, over and over: \u0027Nathan! Nestor! Misha!\u0027 And wondered, would she ever see them again? Five minutes earlier, in the barn: Misha felt Nestor beginning to enter her, and in desperation gasped, \u0027Let me ... let me help you.\u0027 He lifted his face from her breasts and stared at her disbelievingly. But then, as she reached down a hand between their bodies, he could only grunt an astonished, \u0027What?\u0027 Certainly Nestor could use help; not only was his drunkenness a handicap in its own right, he was also inexperienced. For all his swaggering and boasting among Settlement\u0027s youths, and his apparent familiarity with certain of the village girls, he was a virgin no less than Misha herself. Indeed, more so, for she at least seemed to know something. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" She caught him up where he jerked and strained, and tightened her slender hand to a yoke around the neck of his pulsing member. As she began to work at him he murmured, \u0027Ah!\u0027 and rose up from her a little, to allow her more freedom. Never releasing him for a moment but continuing to gratify his flesh, she at once took the opportunity to roll him on to his back. He was young and full of lust; her hand was a warm engine of pleasure, squeezing and pumping at him; it couldn\u0027t last. Aching to touch her, tug at her, feel the warm resilience of her perspiring breasts, he reached out a trembling hand - but too late. And as his fluids geysered and splashed down in long, hot pulses on to his belly, so Nestor groaned and flopped back in the hay. But even lying there in a mixture of mindless ecstasy and empty frustration, still he sensed her straightening her clothing and drawing away from him. And as his tottering senses found their own level, suddenly he wondered: How? How had she known what to do? And trapping her wrist before she could stand up and run from him, his question was written there on his face plain for her to see. As was the answer on hers. \u0027Nathan!\u0027 he snarled then, as she snatched her hand away, got to her feet and backed off. He made to get after her, came to his knees. If she\u0027d learned that much from his not-so-dumb brother, then obviously she knew all of it. And now more than ever, Nestor desired to be into her. If only for the hell of it. Misha saw it in his face, shuddered her terror and flew for the door; he hurled himself ahead of her, slammed it shut. And moving menacingly after her where she stumbled in the dark, he huskily asked: \u0027But why? Why with him? Why Nathan?\u0027 \u0027Because he ... he needed someone,\u0027 Misha\u0027s voice was a frightened whisper. \u0027Because he needed something. But mainly because ... because there was no one else who cared.\u0027 \u0027Well, now there is someone else,\u0027 Nestor growled, his head clearing. \u0027Me! Except I don\u0027t care, not any longer. No, but there is something I need.\u0027 He caught her and lifted her skirts, and when his hand went to her throat she knew that this time she mustn\u0027t fight. But she could still protest. And: \u0027Nestor, please don\u0027t!\u0027 she begged him. \u0027What you\u0027ve done for him, you can do for me,\u0027 his voice was choked with lust and fury. \u0027But we didn\u0027t ...\u0027 she gulped as he pinned her to the wall and positioned himself between her legs. \u0027We\u0027ve never \u0027Liar!\u0027 he snarled. For in his mind\u0027s eye he\u0027d seen them: Nathan and Misha, panting out their lust as their flesh heaved and shuddered. And hoarsely he ordered her: \u0027Now do it, put me in. And after that ... just pretend that I\u0027m Nathan!\u0027 It was like an invocation. \u0027B-b-but you\u0027re not!\u0027 said a stuttering voice from where the barn door now stood open. And it was Nathan, silhouetted against the night, one hand to his face, and the other a fist which was wrapped round the door\u0027s inch-by-three ironwood bar. Nestor half-sobbed, half-moaned as he thrust Misha aside and went for Nathan\u0027s throat - and ran head-on into the flat side of the other\u0027s ironwood club! It smacked him in the face, shook his teeth and flattened his nose, struck him down like a swatted fly. He lay there groaning, clutching his face, while Misha stumbled towards Nathan where he stood with legs spread wide and feet firmly planted, and the bar held high for a second blow. Maybe he would do it, and maybe not, but Misha knew she couldn\u0027t let it happen. And neither could Nathan. Even before she could reach him, he\u0027d turned away and let the bar fall. At which point both of them heard the uproar swelling out from the town\u0027s crowded meeting place, and the throb of powerful propulsors overhead. If they had heard that ominous sound before, then they\u0027d been too young for it to make any lasting impression. But still it was strange, frightening, evocative; as was the wafting stench which suddenly accompanied it. They looked at each other, clung in each other\u0027s arms for the very briefest moment - - Only to be wrenched apart as the roof caved in and the barn flew apart! Then, as their entire world collapsed in chaos all around them, the nightmare they had just lived through commenced its long spiral down from one dark level to depths more lightless yet... Nestor was a child of ten again, playing in the woods with his lieutenant, Nathan, and the Szgany thrall Misha. He, of course, was the vampire Lord Nestor. That was what he had wanted to be all of his young life - what he would always want to be, and the only role he would ever accept - Wamphyri! But this time, and for all that the plot was simple, the game wasn\u0027t working out. Nathan and Misha had joined forces to escape from the aerie (a ramshackle treehouse) into the woods, and Nestor was intent upon finding and punishing them. Indeed, and after a decent interval, they were supposed to let him find them, except today they didn\u0027t seem to be playing according to the rules. And though Nestor had searched for all he was worth for at least half an hour, still they continued to elude him. So that his mounting anger where he slipped through the green maze of the forest, pausing every now and then to sniff at the air in approved vampire fashion, might well be equal (in young boy measure) to that of the legendary Wamphyri themselves. And how he would punish this wayward lieutenant, and this ingrate Szgany slut, when he discovered them! \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" Normally it was easy to find them. He might lean against the bole of a great tree - stand there absolutely motionless, holding his breath in the forest\u0027s often preternatural silence - and wait for a telltale sound to give them away: a furtive rustle of undergrowth, the snap of a dry twig, their whispering, conspiratorial voices. Or if not \u0027voices\u0027 in the plural, one voice at least: Misha\u0027s. For of course Nathan could not, or would not speak, not without sputtering and stuttering like a fool. And so it would be Misha leading the way, doing all the whispering, the planning, the ... cheating? That\u0027s what it was: cheating! Spoiling the game! For by now Nestor should have found them, chastised them, sent them to pick nuts and berries for him as punishment, and stood over them scowling while they filled his mother\u0027s basket. Which was the real reason they were out here in the first place: to fill Nana Kiklu\u0027s basket with wild fruit and nuts. Except, and as always, it had seemed a good idea to turn work into a game. And now he shouted into the green haze all around, \u0027Nathaaan!. ... Mish-aaa!\u0027 ... and waited for their answer. Hah! Try waiting for a birthday, or a wish to come true! So now there was only one thing for it, the one infallible method. Nestor didn\u0027t like to use it, for it seemed to him an intrusion: like that time he stumbled over lovers in the long grass of the foothills, and watched them at their play. He had never forgotten it: all naked backsides and thrusting, jerking flesh. And hurting, too, from the sound of it. If that was love you could keep it! But at the same time he\u0027d known it was wrong of him to watch them ... as had the young man when it was over and finally he\u0027d sensed a peeping-tom there! What a chase that had been, and Nestor lucky to get out of it unscathed. This wasn\u0027t the same, he knew, but it was similar, and he and his brother had this unwritten rule never to use it. Even the very young have things they would rather keep secret, entirely to themselves. Especially their thoughts ... But on the other hand, didn\u0027t Nathan intrude upon him, too, in his dreams? Of course, Nathan would know what he\u0027d done; he would feel him there in his mind, and slam it like a door in his face. Ah, but if he and Misha had played the game as had been intended, Nestor wouldn\u0027t have to do it, now would he? He sat down with his back to a mossy bole, closed his eyes and let his mind drift. Somewhere out there, Misha and Nathan were hiding from him. Somewhere in the deep woods, which they all three knew so well, his brother (no, his \u0027lieutenant\u0027) and the Szgany thrall Misha trembled in terror where they huddled in the forest\u0027s green expanse. But being Wamphyri, Nestor could smell them out! He could extend his senses, or issue a vampire mist, and know when its lapping tendrils touched their shivering flesh! He could scry on them from afar and see them where they cowered! And only let him catch a glimpse of their surroundings, he would know their secret location on the instant! And so his thoughts drifted out until they touched upon Nathan\u0027s. It was difficult and would have been even harder if his brother weren\u0027t distracted, if he\u0027d been looking inwards, as was his wont. But this time his thoughts weren\u0027t clouded; his mind was clear for once, and concentrated upon something entirely different from Nestor and the game. Concentrated in fact upon Misha... ... Misha, swimming naked in sun-dappled shallows, sleek and agile as a fish, and just as innocent. Misha, all silver and gold from the sunlight shimmering on her brown pixy body, laughing as she taunted Nathan, daring him to join her in the water. And seeing Misha through Nathan\u0027s eyes - seeing her exactly as Nathan saw her - it was as if Nestor saw her for the first time, from a different viewpoint or through a different soul ....hich of course was precisely the case. Then Nathan knew he was there and Nestor felt his shock, which caused him to start and bang his head against the tree. In that same moment, the scene on his mind\u0027s eye blurred and blinked out. But not before he recognized their location: the sandy shallows at the river\u0027s bend, where the speckled trout played in the pebbles and eels wriggled in the long grasses. Nestor knew all the shortcuts; he could be there in four or five minutes, before Nathan accepted Misha\u0027s dare and got into the water, and certainly before they were out again, dry and into their clothes. He could be there as quickly as that... but he wouldn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t so much what Nestor had seen through Nathan\u0027s eyes that stopped him, for if anything that would have goaded him on; it was what he\u0027d felt in the other\u0027s inner being. The tumult of emotions there in his unguarded, for once unsuspecting mind. The young man trapped in a little boy\u0027s skin, stretching to break free of it, but held back by the knowledge that he\u0027d be a stranger here alone in a strange land. A fear, then, of growing up, when at last he\u0027d be obliged to accept that he was a part of this world and forced to live in it. The lonely depths of his feelings; the awareness of his own outsideness; the sure knowledge that he was without purpose here and could never belong, except to Nana, and to Nestor ... and to Misha, of course. \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\" All of this concentrated in Nathan\u0027s rapt mind, given focus there and highlighted by this crystal clear vision of innocence: a little girl, naked, swimming, laughing and real - undeniably real! - as if she were a mainstay, a prop, one of the precious few reliable factors in Nathan\u0027s entire world of unreality; which made him fear to reach out and touch her, in case she too was just a mirage. At the time - the real time, the waking moment of the actuality eight years ago, before the dream - Nestor hadn\u0027t understood what he felt. It was hard enough to fathom \u0027love\u0027, without trying to understand something so far beyond it. And much too hard to understand the jealousy which held him back, to walk slowly home on his own; that cold void opening between him and his brother, which made him wish that Nathan really did belong in some other world, and that he would go there, soon. One thing he had known, however, and that was the pain and the anger inside, which Nathan had caused. Yes, and Misha, too. So that if Nestor really were Wamphyri - - Then - then.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-13.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) The vampires have been vanquished!
