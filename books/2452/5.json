{"id":80272,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The matter seemed to be settled: Shaitan was obviously the victim of thieves. He was lucky they\u0027d spared his life.\n \u0027Well, and Dezmir\u0027s right about one thing,\u0027 Klaus Luncani offered Shaitan a chunk of cheese and a bit of coarse bread. \u0027You certainly look big and strong enough! You\u0027ll live, I\u0027m sure.\u0027\n Alas, but you won\u0027t, Shaitan thought, looking at the food in Luncani\u0027s outstretched hand. It was execrable stuff and he shook his head. \u0027I ... I killed a creature,\u0027 he lied, \u0027for its flesh. It wasn\u0027t long ago. I\u0027m not hungry.\u0027\n \u0027A creature?\u0027 This was young Vidra Gogosita.\n \u0027With horns, curving back. Like this.\u0027 And Shaitan used his long slender hands to demonstrate. \u0027A small one, but sweet...\u0027 Though you will be far sweeter.\n \u0027A goat,\u0027 said Dezmir Babeni. \u0027A kid, anyway. Huh! Why, it seems he\u0027s had better luck than all of us together!\u0027\n \u0027A ... goat, yes,\u0027 Shaitan slowly repeated him, with a hand to his forehead, to indicate gradually returning memory.\n \u0027It\u0027ll all come back in time,\u0027 said Klaus Luncani, making a bed for himself in a triangle of boulders a short distance from the fire. \u0027But listen, we\u0027ve been hard at it for most of the day - though there\u0027s only a couple of piglets in our bag to prove it! So now we\u0027ll catch a little sleep. A sight safer than climbing in the dark, for sure! A few hours, that\u0027s all, until the moon\u0027s up again; then it\u0027s back down to the levels and the camp of our leader, Heinar Hagi.\u0027\n Dezmir Babeni took it up. \u0027You\u0027d do well to come with us, Shaitan, as you\u0027ve nothing better in mind. Oh, you\u0027re a strange one, to be sure: tall and pale, with your brains all shaken up in that handsome head of yours. No memory to mention, nor even a tribe to claim you. But the Szgany Hagi have taken in a few strays in their time. So ... what do you say?\u0027\n Shaitan looked up at him, and in that same moment Babeni was struck by the way the fire lit in his eyes. But Shaitan was quick to turn away again, gazing into the glowing embers as before. And: \u0027Get your sleep, all of you,\u0027 he told them. \u0027I shall likewise sleep. And later ... we\u0027ll see what we\u0027ll see.\u0027\n Babeni shrugged, walked off a little way and trampled a bed of bracken for himself; he lay down, pulled a blanket over his lower half, snorted once or twice and fell silent. In his nest of boulders, Klaus Luncani was already snoring. But the youngest of the three, Vidra Gogosita, simply seated himself by the fire, close to Shaitan.\n \u0027I\u0027ll not sleep,\u0027 he said, \u0027but keep watch. It\u0027s my turn. You, however, would do well to get your head down. There\u0027s a blanket I can throw over you.\u0027\n Shaitan nodded, and in a low voice answered, \u0027In a little while.\u0027\n Aye, in a very little while ...\n Of the rest: Vidra remembered very little, and all of it ill-defined, unclear in a mind which had rapidly succumbed to the hypnotic allure of Shaitan. He remembered talking to the - man? - and the feeling of drowsiness, lethargy that had crept over his limbs, his mind, his will.\n There was something about a face (but not Shaitan\u0027s handsome face, surely?) which had changed hideously to a bestial, nightmare mask with the forked tongue and dripping fangs of a snake. The face\u0027s approach ... a blowhole stench, of sulphur? ... and a pain, like the hot sting of a wasp where the artery pulsed in Vidra\u0027s neck ... no, two wasps, stinging him there, inches apart. And Shaitan\u0027s crooning, and his kisses where he sought to suck the stings from - Vidra came awake with a small cry, seemingly in answer to some other\u0027s cry. He was cold and cramped in all his limbs, his neck stiff and caked with a great scab ... of blood? His dream!\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n ... Not a dream?\n He lurched to his feet, stumbling in the ashes at the edge of the fire. But where was his strength? He was dizzy, staggering, weak as water! And tangibly present in his mind - indeed visibly present, burning behind the night scenes which his eyes showed to him - were other eyes, like malignant crimson scars on his soul. Which was precisely what they were. And something was looking at him through those windows on his mind, smiling at him sardonically, leering at him.\n The moon was up, arcing over the mountains; the fire was out except in its heart; a ground mist lay all about, writhing where it lapped the scrubby hillside, filled the small hollows, twined in the roots of bracken and heather. No owls hooted, nor wolves sang, nor any earthly or human sounds at all. But in the shadows over there ... something slobbered!\n That was where Dezmir had made a bed in the bracken, and Vidra lurched in that direction. But here on his right, the triangle of boulders which sheltered Klaus and gave him protection; his legs were sticking out even now, where the mist lapped about them. Vidra stooped, went to grab Klaus\u0027s ankle and shake him awake. Before he could do so, the extended foot gave a massive start, trembled violently, flopped loosely and was still.\n Vidra\u0027s flesh crept. He jerked upright, took two staggering paces down the length of Klaus\u0027s prone body to the cluster of boulders, leaned on them to look down on his sleeping friend - and saw that he wasn\u0027t merely sleeping. Not any longer.\n For someone or something had taken a huge and impossibly heavy rock, levered it up over the top of the three embedded stones, and let it fall squarely on Klaus\u0027s face! Its roughly circular rim entirely obscured the area where his head would be, and in the flooding moonlight it seemed that a tarry substance seeped or was squeezed out from beneath. But Vidra Gogosita knew that the moonlight lied: it wasn\u0027t black but red.\n Scarcely in control of his limbs - choking, unable to cry out by reason of his gulping, the dryness of his throat - the youth went flailing through the sentient mist to where Dezmir Babeni lay in the bracken. \u0027Dezmir!\u0027 he finally forced a warning croak. \u0027Dez ...\n \u0027. .. mir?\u0027\n For Dezmir\u0027s blanket had been thrown aside, and over him now Vidra\u0027s own long jacket, which his mother had begged him to bring with him. Except the jacket seemed alive, humped and mobile, fluttering like some huge black bat fallen to earth!\n Vidra reeled, cried out! And the jacket, and what it contained, flowed upright, stood up and faced him. Shaitan - but no longer handsome, indeed barely human - his monstrous metamorphic face scarlet from gorged blood! And the slimy, alien mist pouring off him like sweat, and billowing out from under his borrowed leather jacket!\n Then ... Shaitan\u0027s talon of a hand reaching out to grip the youth\u0027s arm and steady him, and Vidra knowing for certain the source of those eyes in his mind; knowing, too, the terrible truth of his dream. After that: what else could he do but crumple to his knees before his new master? In any case, his legs no longer had the strength to hold him up. No, for the strength would come later.\n And Shaitan\u0027s burning eyes gazing down upon him, and the monster\u0027s voice a clotted gurgle as he said, \u0027My ways may seem very strange at first, though in the end you\u0027ll gladly embrace them. Only tell me, did I hear you calling for Dezmir Babeni? Well, his blood is still hot, vital, if you are ... ready for that?\u0027\n And then, with perhaps a trace of disappointment, \u0027Ah, a pity. For I see that you are not...\u0027\n The climb down to Sunside\u0027s levels on the fringe of the forest took four hours. By then most of the Szgany Hagi\u0027s lesser campfires were out, and many of the folk asleep in their makeshift tents of animal hide. But the night watch kept a central fire blazing, and when they were not patrolling the perimeter they gathered beside it to talk. There was, too, a little lamplight issuing from the flap doors of several of the larger tents.\n Typically, the tents of the single men formed an evenly spaced outer perimeter: a barrier against intruders or marauders, though in these settled times that was unlikely. A few animals were tethered inside this loose outer circle, or left to graze in corrals roped off between the trees. The larger, family tents stood towards the middle of the camp, with the fire marking the very centre.\n There were several carts, a few of which were covered over with stretched skins, the largest being Heinar Hagi\u0027s caravan. Though the trails around the borders of the tribe\u0027s foothills and forest territories were scarcely better than rutted tracks, still it seemed only decent and right to Heinar - as leader or \u0027king\u0027 of his three-hundred-strong band - to jolt along behind snorting beasts rather than haul a small cart or travois like the rest.\n As for \u0027beating the bounds\u0027 of his enclave: it was either that or have some other Szgany group move in and settle on it. Only by constantly measuring his acreage, patrolling its borders, and every mile or so posting his sigil (a highly stylized face, with a turned down mouth and one eye painted over with a black patch), could Heinar ever hope to hold on to it for his and the tribe\u0027s descendants. The perimeter of these territories was perhaps thirty-six miles, all of which Heinar guarded jealously. It was the same for most bands and tribes, so that in this respect they had been travellers -indeed, Szgany - right from the new beginning.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n But not all of the tribe of Heinar Hagi was on the move. Eastward, in honeycombed cliffs in the roots of the mountains, were caves which housed almost a third of his people. They had sheltered there ever since the holocaust, and there would stay. Likewise in the south, at the edge of the forest where it gave way to grasslands and finally the desert: fifty pioneers of the Szgany Hagi, tending their crops where they\u0027d built permanent homes among the trees. Since both of these locations were on Heinar\u0027s roughly triangular route, he looked forward eagerly to sojourning first in the woodlands camp, then at the caves.\n As his people grew and expanded, so they would build more towns around the perimeter of Heinar\u0027s lands, safely enclosing them. Finally he might be able to settle and live out the rest of his days untroubled by thoughts of land-thieves - except by then Heinar himself would likely be no more, but his sons and their sons would reap the benefits.\n These were his thoughts; and at a hundred campfires large and small, east and west all along the Sunside flank of the barrier range, a hundred leaders just like him thought them alike. And he sat at the central fire, chatting with members of the night watch, with a brew of herb tea simmering on its tripod.\n Then, close by, on the perimeter ...\n ... The familiar half-growl, half-cough of a wolf! -one of the camp\u0027s wolves, it must be. None of the wild grey ones would ever stray so close to such a large body of men. Heinar looked up, his brow furrowing, his good eye glinting in firelight. His men picked up their crossbows; the fire crackled; they all listened to the night.\n There came fresh sounds: of a voice raised in challenge, and of another answering with a gasp, a sob! Heinar believed he knew that second voice. He started to his feet and snapped, \u0027Who\u0027s still out?\u0027\n \u0027The lads you sent into the forest and down to the river, all are safely back,\u0027 one of his men answered. \u0027If these are ours at all, they can only be Klaus, Dezmir and Vidra.\u0027\n \u0027Aye,\u0027 Heinar gave a curt nod of agreement. \u0027That was Vidra\u0027s voice just then, for sure. But what ails the lad?\u0027 No one ventured to answer; they would find out soon enough.\n A party of three entered the clearing: a watchman with his wolf, ushering two others ahead of him. The two came stumbling, dishevelled, apparently exhausted. Heinar recognized only one of them - Vidra Gogosita.\n \u0027Heinar!\u0027 the youth cried. \u0027Heinar!\u0027\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 Heinar demanded, as Vidra all but collapsed in his arms. \u0027What\u0027s happened? Where\u0027s Klaus and Dezmir? And who\u0027s this?\u0027\n \u0027Klaus ... Dezmir ...\u0027 Vidra babbled unashamedly. \u0027Both ....oth of them ... dead! In the hills.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 Heinar gasped. \u0027Dead, you say? How?\u0027\n \u0027We were ... were set upon, ambushed!\u0027 Vidra appeared to make an effort, pulled himself together. \u0027Outlaws! They came out of the twilight. And I\u0027d be dead too, if not ... if not for ... for this one. He ... fought them off, saved my life. His name is ... is ... is ...\" But he could say no more; his eyes rolled up; he sagged in Heinar\u0027s arms.\n The stranger swayed, began to topple. Eager hands caught him, lowered him to a prone position. The fire lit strangely in his eyes as they slowly closed. And his voice was a sigh, trailing into silence as he told them:\n \u0027My name ... is Shaitan.\u0027\n II\n At first, all had been chaos in the camp of Heinar Hagi.\n For almost an hour Heinar and his men, and various women, had chased about, doing their best to care for and see to the immediate needs of young Vidra Gogosita and the stranger he\u0027d brought into the camp, the man called Shaitan.\n Vidra\u0027s mother, the slender but voluble widow Gogosita, had been first on the scene; she had been awake, waiting in her small tent for her only son\u0027s return from the mountains. Hearing something of the excitement, and sensing the sudden tension, the horror creeping in the night, she\u0027d gone to the campfire of her own accord. And when first she\u0027d seen her boy stretched out like that - such a weeping and wailing! But ... Vidra was alive, merely exhausted and sleeping! And how she\u0027d cradled the youth in her arms then, while the men told her what little they knew of the tale. And the endless blessings she\u0027d heaped on the tall pale stranger who had saved her son\u0027s life: Shaitan, who lay there close at hand, as in a coma, absorbing all he could of these people and their ways.\n Then they had sent for the grown-up daughter of Dezmir Babeni, lovely Maria; at first she could not accept the fact of her father\u0027s death, so that she looked in vain for his face among the men. And finally her grief, strong but silent, when at last she went to sit alone, rock herself and weep. And the wife and sons of Klaus Luncani, all dazed and staggering from the impact of this unexpected, unacceptable news. So that the traditional peace and quiet of the campfire had been quickly transformed into a scene of tragedy, grief, trauma.\n No one felt the Szgany Hagi\u0027s loss more than Heinar himself. He couldn\u0027t face the weeping women; giving instructions for the welfare of the survivors of this atrocity, he retired to his bed. He would be up and about at intervals through the long, forty-hours night, of course, but long before sunup he would lead a search party into the foothills, to recover the bodies of the dead. And if by any chance they should stumble on a party of loners or outcasts up there ... But Heinar knew that the odds were all against it.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n Meanwhile, the widow Gogosita had had her son carried to their tent where she watched over him. The badly bruised flesh of his neck was puffy, lacerated, probably infected. His fever was high and he tossed and turned, moaning in his sleep. As for what he moaned: they were things of blackest nightmare, resulting no doubt from what he\u0027d experienced in the hills.\n At the campfire Shaitan had been made comfortable, a blanket thrown over him, his head propped up on a bundled skin. And Maria Babeni had come to sit beside him, staring at his drawn, handsome face in the flaring of the fire. It seemed to her he should be taken in, given proper shelter, cared for and protected until he was fully recovered. Hadn\u0027t he risked his life for the men of the Szgany Hagi? All in vain where her father and Klaus Luncani were concerned ... but at least he had saved young Vidra Gogosita! When the night watch returned she\u0027d have them bring him to her small caravan (hers now, aye, and lonely at that), where she could give him the care he deserved.\n Which was exactly what she did.\n But most of the camp slept on, with the majority knowing nothing of the night\u0027s events; nor would they know until they got up to eat, tend their animals, take turn at watch. Unless something should happen before then, to break the routine.\n And the stars turning in their endless wheel, dappling the clearing at the edge of the woods; and high in the mountains a lone wolf howling for his mistress moon, to rise up again and lend him her light for the hunting ...\n As Maria Babeni prepared for bed behind a curtain, she heard Shaitan stirring, then his moan. Making fast her night clothes, she went to him where he had her father\u0027s narrow bed at the other end of the caravan. By the light of a wick burning in oil, she saw that his face was pale as ever, with long, dark hair swept back, the colour of a raven\u0027s wing, and lips very nearly as red as a girl\u0027s. He would be perhaps forty years old (his looks, at least); his proportions perfect, his brow high, intelligent, lordly. For a man, Shaitan was quite beautiful.\n And she thought: Wherever he comes from, he is not Szgany.\n Then Shaitan opened his eyes.\n And now there could be no mistaking it: his eyes were red!\n Maria gasped where she leaned over him. And quick as her thoughts - just exactly as quick - he grasped her arm, rose up half-way on an elbow ... then closed his eyes, released her and fell back. And knowing what she had seen, he said, \u0027My eyes ... my eyes! They hurt. There\u0027s blood in them. Someone struck me there ...\u0027\n \u0027Bloodshot?\u0027 The word fell from her lips as if conjured, which it had been, half-way. His eyes were bloodshot? So very evenly?\n For a moment, only for a moment, Maria had seen something other than a handsome man. Something hideous lurking behind the beauty. But... it could only be the strangeness of the situation: this man in her father\u0027s bed, and Maria alone with him in the night. Maria, who for all that she was nineteen years old, had known only her father\u0027s close company since the day of her mother\u0027s death. And the fact of a new bereavement slowly sinking in. The aftershock; the enormous hole inside of her; the loneliness. Of course she saw shadows where there were none, and phantoms to inhabit them.\n He moaned again, tried to sit up, again opened his eyes - but kept them half-shuttered. She helped him, propped him up, said, \u0027How did ... how did he die? My father, Dezmir Babeni. He was the short one, bearded, laughing.\u0027\n Shaitan avoided the question. \u0027I didn\u0027t see it all,\u0027 he answered. \u0027I only heard their cries, and went to help. But ... your father?\u0027 And glancing around the caravan, as if noticing his whereabouts for the first time: \u0027Where am I?\u0027 His question was so innocent, childlike.\n She sat on the edge of his bed and told him everything he desired to know. About the Szgany Hagi, the Szgany in general, herself, her situation - everything. And as his eyes opened more fully (but oh so slowly, so gradually), so Maria\u0027s small feelings of anxiety retreated, her ill-formed suspicions fell away, her will was subverted.\n His voice was so low - like the rumble of a great cat, deceptively gentle but full of a fierce energy - and fluent despite its as yet alien use of her tongue. And behind every word a hint, a suggestion, an enticement. Shaitan beguiled, entranced, seduced; of course, for he was the great seducer. He seduced with his eyes, his tongue, the lure of his magnet personality, so unlike anything Maria had ever known before. And despite his strangeness, and the strangeness of her own innermost feelings, awakened now for the first time, she was drawn like a moth to the blood-red fire of his eyes.\n She knew his fingers were at the fastenings of her night clothes, turning them back, laying her flesh bare; but as if to salve each burning brush of those fingers against her sensitized skin, Shaitan poured forth his balm of words. And his furnace heat enveloped her, spreading into every region of her body. So that she grew hot, so very hot.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n Maria felt the perspiration swelling in her pores, forming droplets, trickling from neck and shoulders, breasts and belly. And she heard Shaitan\u0027s honeyed voice confirming the sultry oppression of the night, telling her how hot it was, how good to be free of such clammy restrictions as clothes and bed covers.\n He had turned back his blankets; he sat up and helped her disrobe entirely; their sweat mingled as he rubbed his body against hers. Maria\u0027s breasts were firm and proud, with dark brown buds ... erect, now, where Shaitan stroked her. Before, she\u0027d known only Szgany lads, clumsy buffoons whose hands and faces she\u0027d slapped. But now, when Shaitan stood up, drew off his shirt, stepped from his breeches ... she clung to him and kissed his nipples, and stroked his horn where it steamed and jerked.\n \u0027See?\u0027 he said. \u0027My body would know all of you! For while my eyes have observed this softest of soft fruits,\u0027 and while my hands have touched its perfect skin, still the lips of my probe would test its flesh for succulence. Aye, for I fear it may be bitter, that a worm may have crept into your juicy core, to itch there in the heart of your heat and spoil your flavour. But don\u0027t you feel him itching?\u0027\n He touched her belly, the cleft in her bush, and her thighs lolled open. And: \u0027Ah, you see? You see?\u0027 Shaitan\u0027s face showed his amaze, and a very little of his lust. This dark and secret hole, all unsuspected! That\u0027s where he entered, be sure. So let me in, of your own free will, to drown your worm with my cock\u0027s wet kiss.\u0027\n He entered her in one, long, slow pulse, breaking her without pause and feeling her sweet virgin\u0027s blood hot on his bony shaft. And Maria\u0027s hunger was such that she might cry aloud for more, but could only gasp and gurgle as he rode to and fro, in and out between her salivating lips.\n And for a long, long time Shaitan took Maria in every way he knew and others which he invented, until his lust was sated, however temporarily. And sprawling there lewdly, with the girl all bruised and insensible between his thighs, and his sperm like foam on all her openings, he thought: These people are clever, yet in many ways they are innocent as trogs. And like the trogs, the Szgany Hagi shall be mine!\n It was Shaitan\u0027s first major error. His stay with the trogs had lasted for two long years, and little occurring in all that time to tax or stimulate his superior mind and talents; so that in certain respects he had grown lax, and perhaps as naive as the trogs themselves. But as he would soon discover, the men of Sunside were in no way trogs.\n For now, however ... his excesses with the girl had wearied him. He would join Maria in sleep a while.\n Which was his second big mistake ...\n One third of the way into the night, Turgo Zolte was called to his duty watch. Zolte was a big, taciturn man; tough, iron-grey in the eyes, with shoulder-length hair to match. He wore silver earrings, a silver buckle on his belt, silver buttons to fasten his black clothes; like all Sunsider men he jingled when he walked, only more so. Zolte was a loner, not quite an outsider. The Szgany Hagi had accepted him now.\n He\u0027d come to them only a year ago, chased out of his own far western band by a chief whose son he\u0027d killed. According to him, it was a fair fight; the other had called him out over a woman, and Turgo had broken his neck. Well, he had the brawn for it, certainly; and since there was no lack of space among the Hagis for big, strong fighting men - so long as they were working men, too - Heinar had let him stay. Since when no one had bothered with Turgo Zolte very much, and he\u0027d kept mainly to himself. But if a man could catch him in the right frame of mind, with a jug of good plum brandy inside him, he might occasionally tell a few wild tales of his latter days along the western reaches. Campfire tales, of bogeymen and beasts. His audience might snort a bit, but none called him a liar.\n This night, when Turgo reported to the fire, the tables were turned; the man he relieved was the one with the tale to tell. Turgo heard it out, scowled and narrowed his glinty eyes, finally said, \u0027You saw all of this? Young Vidra with his neck torn and scabbed? And this stranger - he was pale, you say? Not much of a description!\u0027\n The other shrugged. \u0027What\u0027s to describe? A man: tall, pale, with a girl\u0027s long soft hands. Somehow, he didn\u0027t look Szgany - he was all smooth and unweathered, like he\u0027d lived in a cave all his days. And his eyes were ... they seemed full of blood!\u0027\n \u0027Blood? In his eyes?\u0027\n \u0027Exactly! Like he\u0027d been poked in them, or had sand thrown in \u0027em - which no doubt he had, in the fighting.\u0027\n Turgo\u0027s own eyes narrowed more yet and he nodded, mainly to himself. And sitting down by the fire, he said, \u0027Tell me more, everything, but in finer detail. Leave nothing out.\u0027\n The telling didn\u0027t take very long.\n And shortly -\n - Heinar Hagi came awake instantly, looked at the earnest face of the man who had given him a shake, grunted and glanced up through an opening in the roof of his caravan at the night sky. He knew the hour at once, from the position of the stars, grunted again and growled, \u0027Anyway, I was due to be up about now.\u0027\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n Turgo Zolte wasn\u0027t much of a diplomat. He shrugged and said, \u0027Due or undue, you\u0027re up.\u0027 And: \u0027It looks like there\u0027s business to attend to, Heinar. Bad business, I fear.\u0027\n Heinar threw on his clothes, put on his eye-patch to cover the hole which an eagle had torn in his face when he was just a lad. Teach him to hunt eggs in the heights! \u0027Business?\u0027 He repeated the other. \u0027You\u0027ll be talking about murderers in the hills, right? Aye, we\u0027ll be doing what we can - but at sunup. You want to come along, you\u0027re welcome. Couldn\u0027t it wait?\u0027\n Turgo shook his head, stepped down from the caravan into the night, waited for Heinar to join him. \u0027Not what I\u0027ve got to say,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Not unless you want to see plague in the camp, spreading through all your people!\u0027\n And now Heinar was very much awake. \u0027What?\u0027 he grasped the other\u0027s arm. \u0027Plague?\u0027\n Turgo nodded. \u0027But quiet! Let\u0027s not wake the entire camp. Not yet. Now listen, and I\u0027ll tell you what I heard from the watch. Except I know it may have been exaggerated. But you were there, so if all tallies ...\u0027 He repeated the story of the watchman. And when he was done:\n \u0027Aye, that\u0027s the story,\u0027 Heinar grunted. \u0027Blow for blow.\u0027\n \u0027Huh!\u0027 Turgo returned his grunt. \u0027Well, and now I\u0027ve a different story for you ...\"\n And after a moment, as they made for the campfire: \u0027I came from west of here, as you know,\u0027 Turgo began, \u0027out of the tribe and territories of Ygor Ferenc. That\u0027s way up at the end of the barrier range, where the hills slump into misted valleys, fens and mire. The swamps are dire: quicksands, mosquitoes, leeches, but the Ferenc\u0027s borders fall short of them by a good seventy miles - which to my mind is still too close by far!\u0027\n They had reached the fire; the watchmen were out, patrolling the camp\u0027s perimeter; Turgo seated himself on a stool and Heinar chose the well-worn branch of a fallen tree. They each took tea, strong and bitter, and eventually Turgo continued.\n \u0027Well, about eighteen months ago, some funny things began to happen there on the edge of nowhere. As you\u0027d imagine, they have their share of mountain men up there, much as you do down here: loners who take to the hills, look after themselves, live on their own in the wild. And now and then such a one will come into camp with a beast he\u0027s killed, too much meat for one man, and they\u0027ll usually make him welcome. There\u0027ll be a feast, and brandy to wash it down; the women will dance till sundown; the likely lads will end up fighting ... and so on. That\u0027s how it goes.\n \u0027But there in the western reaches, that wasn\u0027t always the way it went, not in the last six-month. Some of the mountain men up there in the misty hills where they descend to the valleys and swamps, and even the occasional lone wolf ... they were suddenly changed, different. Something weird had got into them.\n There were rumours: about men with red eyes, madmen with the lusts of beasts, and wolves that snatched people right off the fringes of their camps and territories! Always by night, or in the light of the moon. It was like an infection, a sickness spreading out of the swamps, and people grew wary of any stranger who might come into their camps at twilight or sundown. But in the Ferenc\u0027s camps, or on the march, beating his bounds ... well, as I\u0027ve said, all of this was rumour. The other camps may have been hit, if the stories were true, but old Ygor was the lucky one. For a while, anyway.\n Then, just before I landed in trouble - Ygor\u0027s hotheaded fool of a son, Ymir, forcing me to kill him over a woman\u0027s favours and what all - that\u0027s when the luck of the Szgany Ferenc ran out. It happened like this:\n \u0027I was out with Ygor and maybe a dozen others, beating the bounds just like now. One twilight, we reached this old clearing where we\u0027d make camp. Ygor knew the place well enough: it was about as far west as folks have ever journeyed, except for the loners, of course, who often step where no one else would. Nothing superstitious about that, it\u0027s just that west of there the ground\u0027s no good for growing things; the water\u0027s scummy and the mists are far too frequent. It\u0027s like the end of the world! But old Ygor, he likes to beat the ground there anyway, to make sure no one will come down out of the hills and settle on it.\n \u0027And there in the clearing, that\u0027s where we found Oulio lonescu - something that looked like Oulio, anyway ...\u0027\n As Turgo paused, so Heinar cast him a sharp glance. \u0027Eh? Something that looked like him?\u0027\n \u0027Give me a chance and I\u0027ll explain,\u0027 the other held up a restraining hand. And after a moment\u0027s thought:\n \u0027Oulio was one of these types who\u0027d come into camp for an evening\u0027s entertainment. Oh, he liked his own company best, but from time to time got a little too much of it. His parents had been mountain people, too - until an avalanche killed them - and Oulio had a cave up there somewhere. Also, he was known to wander west and trap big lizards in the swamps. See this belt of mine? A bit of Oulio\u0027s good leather.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n \u0027So, we knew him well. Or thought we did. But this time he was in trouble.\n \u0027At first we didn\u0027t know what we\u0027d stumbled over. The Oulio we knew was big and wild as they come: clothes all in patches, eyes black as night, hair like a waterfall. And garrulous? He was full to the brim of words that didn\u0027t mean much, all spilling out of him because he\u0027d kept them so long bottled up. He played his fiddle like no one I ever heard, drank brandy like water, would dance till he fell. But he danced alone, because he was wary of the women.\n \u0027But now? Well, he wouldn\u0027t be doing any dancing for a while, for sure.\n \u0027How long he\u0027d wandered like that, who knows? But it had slimmed him down a lot. All of his fat was gone, and quite a bit of his skin, too. Why, he was ... black! Burned black, by the sun, as it turned out. But he was red, too. Red where the skin had peeled from his face and limbs, and red in his eyes. Aye, red as blood. And there he lay, sprawled like a dead man in the clearing, with only the occasional twitch or moan to hint of any life left in him at all.\n \u0027We looked after him. We didn\u0027t know what had befallen him, but despite all rumours and old wives\u0027 tales we cared for him. Even as we\u0027re now caring for this stranger ...\u0027\n \u0027Eh?\u0027 Heinar gave a start. \u0027The stranger? But he was here, by the fire!\u0027\n \u0027Until Maria Babeni took him in,\u0027 Turgo nodded grimly. \u0027She had him carried to her cart.\u0027\n And now Heinar thought that maybe he understood something of what was going on here; for he knew that Turgo had paid one or two small, polite attentions to Maria, even though the girl hadn\u0027t seemed to notice or acknowledge them. But Turgo saw the Hagi\u0027s thoughts written plain in his one good eye, and:\n \u0027Better let me finish,\u0027 he said, \u0027before you go jumping to any conclusions.\u0027\n \u0027Get on with it, then,\u0027 Heinar told him.\n \u0027Oulio was taken to the tent of one of the younger men, a man who had his young wife with him. There were four couples like that, who\u0027d come along to form the germ of a settlement in the woods to the south, much as you\u0027ve started a permanent camp south of this place. He and his slip of a wife knew Oulio from other times; they took him in, bathed him, laid him on a clean blanket and rubbed good butter and salt into all of his sore places. By which time it was night.\n \u0027As darkness came down in full and the moon came up, so this same young man was called to keep watch. And he left his girl wife tending the much-ravaged Oulio. Ah, but when he came back all those hours later...\n \u0027... Only picture it, only imagine the lad\u0027s horror, to discover his much-ravaged wife! And Oulio still grinding away at her like a pig; her breasts all bruised and bloodied from his long nails, and the beast they\u0027d cared for using her as worst he could. He\u0027d gagged her, tied her hair to the tent\u0027s pole at the floor. But he\u0027d hit her once or twice, too, and broken her nose and jaw, before having her whichever way he fancied. And he\u0027d fancied them all!\n \u0027And there stood this young man, at the flap of his tent, and his wife broken like a doll and still being used by this flame-eyed fiend! Worse, Oulio\u0027s teeth were like fangs, which he\u0027d stuck in her neck to suck her blood! And as he heard the lad\u0027s horrified gasp behind him, so he bit down on the artery and sliced it through!\n \u0027He turned his head and glared at the intruder, snarling at him like a wolf! And his face wasn\u0027t dissimilar to that of a wolf, except his eyes weren\u0027t feral but crimson! Red as the blood which spurted with each faltering heartbeat from this poor girl\u0027s torn neck!\u0027\n Heinar\u0027s eye bulged and he gripped Turgo\u0027s arm. \u0027Man, what a story!\u0027 His voice was hoarse. \u0027But finish it.\u0027\n The other nodded, and continued: The lad had been on watch and carried his crossbow with him, loaded. For a moment he\u0027d been paralysed, unmanned; but now he screamed his outrage, let fly, put a bolt through the sod close to his black heart. It would have finished any other man, to be stuck through and through like that with a hardwood bolt, only a hairbreadth from his heart. But not Oulio, not the thing which Oulio had become. With the strength of a maniac, he knocked the husband aside, kicked him in the face, and rushed out of the tent into the sleeping camp. His hissing and howling woke all of us up ...\n \u0027Well, everything I\u0027ve told so far is the way I heard it and how I remember it. But from here on in it\u0027s the way I saw it. And I\u0027ve no sinister motive for telling this tale, Heinar; no, for I\u0027ve learned my lesson where women are concerned, and I\u0027m not much of a one for subterfuge. But the Szgany Hagi took me in and for that I owe you a favour. So here\u0027s how the rest of it goes:\n \u0027Before the camp was fully awake, before anyone could say, ask, or do anything, this young lad - who was now mad as Oulio himself - put another bolt in him, in his spine. Oulio toppled into the campfire, and the lad had him! He grabbed a leg, dragged him screaming out of the cinders, noosed him round the neck and strung him up from a tree there and then! And then he took us to his wife, so that we\u0027d understand.\n \"Vampire World 1 - Blood Brothers\"\n \u0027We\u0027d understand some of it, anyway ...\n \u0027And no one cut Oulio down, so that he might well be swinging there yet, except ... that wasn\u0027t the end of it. No, not by a long shot.\n \u0027For at sunup, Oulio\u0027s coughing and grunting brought us awake again! He was still alive, yes! With a rope round his neck, his face all purple, dangling there in mid-air; one bolt skewering him through the chest, and another deep in his spine. And none of these things had killed him! But something was in the offing which would for sure. It was the sun, coming up over the trees and blazing down into the clearing. And when it lit on Oulio - how he smoked and steamed!\n \u0027And then ... this awful, impossible commotion: he choked and kicked and danced up there! Until the knot came loose, letting him down. And so he crumpled to the ground and lay there, staring at us with those scarlet eyes of his. And we called for the lad, who\u0027d just finished burying his poor wife, to come and finish it. It seemed only right...\n \u0027He brought a machete and went to Oulio where he lay. But before he could take his head ... the monster spoke to him! Oh, he didn\u0027t cry out, beg for mercy, plead for his life; none of that. His throat, all puffy and grooved, wouldn\u0027t have allowed for it, and anyway he had no wind. And in a voice no more than a hoarse whisper, he said: \"I\u0027m sorry! It wasn\u0027t me!\"\n The liar! For of course the lad, and everyone else, knew it had been none other! Half crazy, the poor bereaved husband snarled and his machete went up, but before it could fall ... Oulio began to choke and flop about, so that we knew it was the end of him. And perhaps the lad thought, \"Why should I make it easier for him?\" At any rate, he stayed his hand.\n \u0027And so Oulio flopped about in his death agonies; his mouth yawned open and his neck grew fat, and his purple face swelled up as if to burst. Until at last... at last something came out of him!\u0027\n Heinar half started to his feet. \u0027Something? What sort of something? Was he sick? Did he throw up his guts?\u0027\n Turgo shook his head. \u0027His guts, no. He threw up nothing. I saw it and I remember. I remember what I thought: that this thing wanted to be out of him! Because while he was finished, there might be another chance for it. Don\u0027t ask me where the idea came from, but that\u0027s what I thought.\u0027\n \u0027But what was it?\u0027\n Turgo shrugged, then shuddered, which was something Heinar had never seen him do before. \u0027A huge slug, a leech, a great fat blindworm - don\u0027t ask me, for I don\u0027t know. It was partly black, grey, leprous, ridged, writhing. Big as a boy\u0027s arm, I thought it would split his face! And it dragged itself out of him and wriggled for cover - because just like Oulio it felt the sunlight. Its head was flattened, like a snake\u0027s, but it was blind, eyeless. Yet somehow, it sensed the lad\u0027s machete still raised on high and reared back from it. But too late ... he was quick ... he struck off its head!\n \u0027A moment more and men unfroze, sprang forward, kicked the wriggling pieces into the fire. Then ... we all looked at each other - all of us, with faces white as chalk - and we looked at the lad, who used his great knife again. This time he took Oulio\u0027s head: two, three strokes ... it was done. And again we tossed both parts into the fire, then stood there till they\u0027d burned to ashes ...\u0027\n Heinar stared hard at Turgo, who gazed back unblinkingly. And Heinar knew that every word of it had been the truth. For who could embellish a thing like that? Finally he said, This Shaitan\u0027s eyes were red. I thought it was only the firelight, reflected in them. Well, maybe it was - and maybe it wasn\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027We\u0027ll know for sure at sunup,\u0027 the other answered. \u0027But do you really want to wait that long? Right now, who or whatever that man is, he\u0027s with Maria Babeni, in her caravan. And maybe he\u0027s with her just like Oulio was with that girl. Also, Heinar, my story still isn\u0027t finished.\u0027\n There\u0027s more? But what else can there be?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-5.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \n The vampires have been vanquished!
