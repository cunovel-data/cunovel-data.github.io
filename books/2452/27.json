{"id":80294,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"\u0027Nathaaan! Nathan!\u0027 The transition from one evil voice in his metaphysical mind to another in his entirely physical ears was confusing ... until a claw-like hand grasped his shoulder and shook him, rocking him in his bed.\n \u0027Who? What...?\u0027 He came gasping awake.\n \u0027Who indeed?\u0027 Maglore\u0027s face was hideous - and accusing? - in the yellow-flaring light of the gas jets, where he leaned over him. \u0027Who is it comes to visit you in your sleep, Nathan? Who do you talk to, secretly, in your dreams?\u0027\n \u0027My dreams?\u0027 Nathan\u0027s guard was firmly in place. Quickly awake, he tried to sit up and Maglore withdrew a little to let him. \u0027Was I dreaming?\u0027 His brow was feverish and he was trembling. \u0027Yes, yes I was! But not a dream, a nightmare, which now has gone.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, a nightmare!\u0027 Maglore nodded curtly, his red eyes swivelling this way and that, as if seeking out some vestige of the unknown visitant. \u0027That which comes in the darkness to terrify the sleeping mind. The memory of some fearful event out of the past, perhaps, or the prescience of that which is yet to befall.\u0027 He cocked his head in a listening attitude, sniffing at the air like a hound before seating himself on the edge of Nathan\u0027s bed. The result of gluttonous overeating, or merely a case of conscience. But ... guilty conscience, perhaps?\u0027\n Nathan kept his mind shielded and played the inno- cent. It wasn\u0027t difficult, for after all he was innocent. \u0027Did I eat too much, Master?\u0027 He ignored the implied accusation.\n Maglore narrowed his eyes, but still Nathan saw right into them. The master of Runemanse was thinking, Does he continue to play word games with me? One thing for sure: he\u0027s no fool, this Nathan.\n But as Maglore stood up, so he made inquiry; \u0027And are you hungry?\u0027\n Nathan threw back his blankets, thrust his feet over the edge of the bed and joined the Seer Lord on his feet. \u0027I think I am,\u0027 he said. He glanced out of the high window and noted the orientation of the stars. And so he should be hungry, for he\u0027d slept half-way through sundown!\n Then you did not eat too much,\u0027 Maglore told him. \u0027And so we\u0027re left with a case of conscience; or perhaps some real however intangible thing, which came to you in your sleep. Do you believe in ghosts?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Nathan at once, relieved that he could speak the truth. Of course he believed in ghosts, for he of all men knew that they were real, even though they were not always the dark phantoms of myth which men supposed. But Maglore, for all that he was a mage, didn\u0027t know that.\n The Seer Lord nodded. \u0027And so you should believe in them, and especially here. Let me advise you, Nathan, that Turgosheim has known a variety of terrible men and creatures. Though they themselves are gone, their auras dwell here still. And in Runemanse, you are not the only one who dreams dark dreams.\u0027\n He looked Nathan up and down. \u0027But tell me, why are you dressed? You did not simply fall asleep on top of the bed, for I saw you under the covers. Is there something here which you fear? Has someone ... bothered you?\u0027 His frown brought his eyebrows crushing inwards under a warp of wrinkled forehead. And once again he glanced this way and that, and sniffed the air. Until, in a moment: \u0027A woman!\u0027 he said.\n \u0027She did me no harm,\u0027 Nathan shook his head. \u0027She showed me the way here, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n Maglore glared at him furiously. \u0027What? She showed you the way? Oh, she would do that, all right! Any one of them would do that!\u0027 He grasped Nathan\u0027s arm. \u0027Who was she? Did she touch you, kiss you, offer you her body? Speak, fool! Did you take her?\u0027 But even as Nathan began to shake his head: \u0027What? Do you lie to me? Why, there\u0027s not a horny red-blooded man born of woman who could deny those whores of mine, except maybe a whelp who doesn\u0027t know what a woman is!\u0027\n Nathan felt his ears burning red ...\n Astonished, the Seer Lord gazed deep into his eyes, and saw the truth written there. \u0027What?\u0027 he said. \u0027A strapping man, Szgany, almost twenty years old and never bedded a woman? Hah!\u0027 He slapped his thigh. \u0027Little wonder they\u0027re prettied up and on the prowl! I\u0027ve never seen them so agitated! But ... can it be true? You\u0027re a virgin?\u0027\n \u0027I... I had a ... g-g-girl, Szgany,\u0027 Nathan answered. It was the first time he\u0027d stumbled and stuttered in a long time. And now he resolved never to do it again. \u0027She was stolen away by Canker Canison, into Starside,\u0027 his voice hardened. \u0027Perhaps she would have been mine, if things had been different. Anyway, we kept apart from taking lovers, and waited for each other.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, true love!\u0027 Maglore fluttered long, almost furry eyelashes and sighed sarcastically. \u0027The dog Canker got her, yes?\u0027 He shook his head, made sympathetic clucking noises. \u0027I trust you have forgotten her? If not, you may safely do so.\u0027\n Nathan was not required to reply.\n \u0027Now, try to understand my concern, my anger,\u0027 Mag-lore\u0027s tone was conciliatory. \u0027If you are seduced by some creature of mine, you will no longer be your own creature, and therefore of no earthly use to me. It is my desire to keep your blood, body, and very mind clean and free of other influences - except my own. For I have enough of vampires, and at times the fawning of thralls becomes an annoyance. This is no unique situation, however; you will not be the first entirely human being who ever stayed in Runemanse ...\" He paused, and in a little while continued:\n \u0027Well, and no doubt you are wondering why I\u0027m here. Since I was passing this way I thought to look in on you, and if you were awake bring you to table. You shall take all of your meals with me, for sometimes I crave the company of common men. Also, it seems I must keep you safe - for the time being, anyway - until I can make other arrangements.\u0027 He spoke musingly, almost to himself. But then:\n \u0027Come,\u0027 he made for the door. \u0027You can wash in my apartments, and while we eat we shall continue our conversation. I desire to know you better, my son. For after all, your welfare is in my hands ...\u0027 Maglore glanced at Nathan sideways where he hurried to keep up, but the Seer Lord\u0027s thoughts were now as inscrutable as his expression ...\n Entering the great hall from the corridor, Nathan came face to face with the vampire girl who had attempted his seduction. She turned her face away immediately but Maglore had seen. He paused in his striding, nodded grimly, and called her back. She came smiling, eager, but ghosting in the awful flowing fashion of a vampire.\n \u0027So,\u0027 said Maglore. \u0027It is Magda. You were the one.\u0027\n She glared at Nathan and faced up to Maglore, determined to brazen it out. \u0027But he\u0027s one of yours, master, which you have brought into Runemanse. I thought to have him before the others, that\u0027s all, and he gave me the opportunity by asking me the way to his room. But as it happens, he\u0027s one of three things: a eunuch, or queer, or a child who still thinks it\u0027s for pissing! Me: I like a man with backbone. And so no harm done. Besides which, I had no instructions to the contrary.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps not, at the time,\u0027 said Maglore nodding, chucking her under the chin almost affectionately.\n She rubbed against him and brushed his shoulder with her cheek. Then I have not offended?\u0027\n Maglore had been half-smiling. Now the mask slipped from his face and he called for one of his men. At the sound of his voice, a silence fell on the great hall. Then a lieutenant came striding, and Magda tried to back away. But Maglore held her.\n Nathan glanced around the great hall. Nearby, a squad of pallid thralls gouged with heavy flint chisels at a wall of pumice; but work stopped as gaunt, hollow faces turned inwards on the drama. Feral eyes lit with morbid fascination, and perhaps with something of grim anticipation, too. A small group of women, pounding washing at a trickling water sluice, looked up and nudged each other, and grinned. They were drudges, most of them, older than Magda and perhaps jealous of her.\n Maglore saw that, too. \u0027Did you wager for him?\u0027 he asked her as his lieutenant approached.\n \u0027We drew straws,\u0027 she snarled, still struggling. \u0027And I won.\u0027\n \u0027Fool!\u0027 Maglore told her. \u0027You lost! Where orders exist you obey them, and where there are none you do nothing. That is the rule, in Runemanse. The others know that, and so they let you win. They were baiting you, trying Nathan, and testing ... me!\u0027\n He tossed her into his man\u0027s arms, grew taller and glowered all about the cavern. \u0027Testing me?\u0027 he shouted, his face livid with a fire which seemed to burn through the very bone. \u0027Well, and let this be a lesson to all of you. I need not say more than this ...\u0027 He glanced at his lieutenant, and twitched his head in a negligent gesture: \u0027... Magda is for the provisioning!\u0027\n The girl screamed once and clawed for the lieutenant\u0027s eyes; he jerked back his head, struck her with a massive fist that broke her jaw and knocked her senseless. And the last Nathan saw of her, she was being carried away.\n For a moment the silence seemed to ring ... then Maglore headed for the spiral staircase with Nathan following on. But this time he knew better than to plead for the girl, for the Seer Lord\u0027s mind was seething like a cauldron full of poison. And as they climbed the central stairs, slowly the great hall came back to life behind them ...\n At Maglore\u0027s table, Nathan had no appetite. He picked at his food when the Wamphyri Lord insisted, but his spirit felt so weighted, depressed, that the morsels would not go down. And he wondered about Magda. Perhaps he\u0027d left his mind unguarded; in any case he was jolted and learned a lesson from it, when Maglore said:\n \u0027Forget about her. You won\u0027t see her again. And anyway, why concern yourself about someone who would have drained you in a trice?\u0027\n \u0027Because I feel it was my fault, master.\u0027\n \u0027It was no one\u0027s fault. It was Nature\u0027s fault: the nature of the vampire. But I am glad you refused her. So should you be glad, for your continued existence.\u0027\n \u0027Everything in Runemanse appears a threat,\u0027 Nathan answered before he could control his thoughts or words. \u0027There\u0027s no innocence here.\u0027\n \u0027Well, there is now,\u0027 Maglore contradicted him. \u0027Aye, and there was before. Perhaps not entirely innocent, but certainly human. Didn\u0027t I tell you that you weren\u0027t the first human being to stay in Runemanse? If I let my ... ladies see you and she together, then perhaps they\u0027ll leave you alone. I have sent for her and she will join us in a little while.\u0027\n \u0027She, master?\u0027\n Maglore waved a dismissive hand. \u0027Ask no more. Now I have questions for you. For instance: you say you don\u0027t know women, yet wore a locket with a curl of pubic hair. And Thyre hair at that! Explain it, if you will.\u0027\n Nathan shrugged. \u0027It\u0027s a custom of the Thyre when brother and sister part. Atwei was like a sister to me.\u0027\n \u0027And how did you know her so well?\u0027\n \u0027I got to know her, in my long wanderings in the desert.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, yes, I remember,\u0027 Maglore nodded. \u0027You told me about that on our way here. After Wratha and her renegades fell upon your tribe and destroyed it, you walked out into the desert to die. But the Thyre found you and you joined them, and wandered east with them from oasis to oasis. You skirted the Great Red Waste and lived like the desert trogs themselves, on the flesh of lizards and the juice of cactus plants.\u0027 Maglore blinked and shook his head. \u0027So much sunlight and so little colour. Why did you not burn?\u0027\n \u0027I wore a cowled Thyre robe,\u0027 Nathan lied, \u0027and kept to the shade wherever possible. Then, when I came to Turgosheim\u0027s Sunside, I lived on the fringe of the forest a while before I heard of lozel and sought him out. In the forest\u0027s shade, my skin grew pale ... which in any case had never been dark.\u0027\n \u0027Why did you seek lozel out?\u0027 Maglore\u0027s questions were coming closer to the mark. Nathan must think fast, and guard his thoughts at the same time.\n \u0027I heard he was a mystic who understood strange things. Perhaps he could explain the numbers which plague my dreams, and the reason I feel like a stranger in the presence of my own kind.\u0027 He tugged at the twisted strap on his wrist. \u0027He might also know why I wear this, which has become a part of me.\u0027\n \u0027Ah!\u0027 Maglore was distracted, fascinated at once, just as Nathan had hoped he would be. \u0027Take it off. Let me see it again.\u0027 Nathan did so, and Maglore picked it up and said: \u0027So, the sigil puzzles you even as it puzzles me. Why did you not say so?\u0027\n \u0027I have lived with it,\u0027 Nathan answered. \u0027I wear it like my hair. Yet while it seems nothing special, I know that it is special, for it is also your sigil. It seemed presumptuous of me to claim it for my own.\u0027\n And at last Maglore chuckled. \u0027Not to say dangerous, eh?\u0027\n \u0027That, too,\u0027 Nathan answered.\n \u0027Well, and we learn more about you all the time,\u0027 the Seer Lord nodded, tossing the strap onto the table. \u0027You\u0027re not so naive after all. And did lozel know the sigil? Could he tell you anything about it?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, he knew it, master,\u0027 said Nathan. \u0027But did he know about it? - no, nothing. He was a fraud! I myself know more.\u0027\n \u0027You do? Explain.\u0027\n Nathan took up the strap. \u0027I have ... noticed things. In quieter moments, I have studied this device.\u0027\n \u0027A device?\u0027 said Maglore, raising a feathery eyebrow. \u0027Oh, really? Do you think so? Ahhh!\u0027\n \u0027How many sides has it?\u0027\n \u0027Eh? A question?\u0027 Maglore leaned over the table and tested the leather between thumb and forefinger. \u0027Sides? Why, two, of course.\u0027\n \u0027One,\u0027 Nathan shook his head. \u0027For it defies the eye, do you see?\u0027 He brought a sliver of charcoal from the fireplace and drew a line on the brown leather, down the centre of its width. As the line lengthened he turned the strap on the table, until the head of the line met up with its tail.\n \u0027Ahhh.\u0027\u0027 Maglore\u0027s great jaw fell open.\n And Nathan asked him: \u0027How many edges has it?\u0027\n \u0027Eh? Edges?\u0027 Maglore\u0027s eyes darted from the strap to Nathan\u0027s face and back again. \u0027Why, two, plainly. What is it but a strip of leather, after all? There must be two edges, if only to separate the space between them!\u0027\n \u0027One,\u0027 Nathan said again.\n \u0027No!\u0027 said Maglore, astonished. \u0027Let me try it!\u0027 He blackened the strap\u0027s rim with charcoal, until \u0027each\u0027 edge (in fact there was only one, as Nathan had pointed out) was smudged with soot. Then ... the Seer Mage\u0027s eyes were very wide as he carefully put the strap down. And:\n \u0027For all of sixteen years I have known this thing,\u0027 he said, \u0027even taking it for my sigil. Yet I have never \"known\" it! But now, through you ...\" He gazed at Nathan in something approaching wonder. \u0027Well, in alerting me to your presence, lozel Kotys has paid his dues at last. For indeed there is this bond between us.\u0027\n He might have gone on to say more, except that was when \u0027she\u0027 arrived ...\n II She was beautiful in a wan, subdued sort of way, but it was obvious that she was not a vampire. Her eyes were as black as any Szgany eyes Nathan had ever seen, and despite the lack of sunlight - or perhaps because of it - her flesh had taken on a unique creamy texture. No longer the tanned, natural, light golden brown of a Gypsy, still her colour appeared healthier than Nathan\u0027s, and it could never be mistaken for the pallor of a thrall or the sickly grey of an undead vampire thing.\n Long-legged and dressed in a black sheath split up the sides to mid-thigh, and in a gauzy blouse which scarcely concealed the elastic globes of her breasts, she approached the table and bowed from the waist. Her hair, straight, black as jet, and cut in a fringe over her eyes, was long at the sides and fell forward to frame her oval face. But as she straightened her back and stood tall, waiting for her master\u0027s command, her eyes were only for Maglore. So that Nathan supposed she dared not look at him, not in the presence of her Wamphyri Lord.\n \u0027Orlea,\u0027 Maglore acknowledged her presence with a smile, indicating that she should take a seat at the table. \u0027Eat with us.\u0027 And, as she sat down: This is Nathan, and you shall know him well. He is new here and Runemanse is very strange to him. I shall require you to show him all of its levels, rooms, and functions. Nowhere shall be forbidden. He shall be as you are, a free person - within those limits which I impose.\u0027\n While Maglore placed some choice tidbits on a plate and passed it to her, Orlea glanced at Nathan, perhaps curiously. Then, lowering her eyes, she picked at her food.\n Nathan thought it might be as well to make conversation. \u0027Despite my colouring,\u0027 he spoke to Orlea, \u0027I am Szgany. But I came here out of the west, from beyond the Great Red Waste.\u0027 Perhaps she, and Maglore too, would take it that there were other anomalies of pigmentation in those distant regions. In any case, it was an opening.\n She looked at Maglore for his approval, and he nodded. And turning a little more towards Nathan, she asked: \u0027How is it now, on Sunside?\u0027 Her voice was soft, pleasant, but completely lacking in animation; and never a smile to betray her emotions. In fact she seemed drained of all emotion. Nathan could well understand that.\n \u0027My Sunside, in the west, or yours?\u0027\n \u0027My own,\u0027 she answered.\n \u0027Do you miss it?\u0027 Maybe he was taking a chance. Perhaps she would also take a chance, and answer him truthfully. But she didn\u0027t, or so he believed at that time.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027My life was hard there.\u0027\n Then why do you ask after it?\u0027\n Maglore interrupted. \u0027Good! And so you\u0027ll converse and find things in common. But I suspect my presence inhibits you, and anyway I have things to do. Orlea, first I would speak to you ...\" He stood up and moved apart; she went to him and they talked a while in lowered tones; finally Maglore left the two on their own and went about his business.\n As they made an end of their meal, Nathan looked at the spread table. \u0027What about these things?\u0027\n \u0027Just as you and I have our duties here, so others have theirs,\u0027 Orlea answered him. She indicated the table. \u0027All of this will be attended to; but for now Mag-lore has tasked me to show you Runemanse, and tasked you to observe closely and remember the things you see. No great difficulty in that; I know you will remember, just as I remembered in my time. Indeed, I cannot forget.\u0027\n He followed her to a room with a staircase, which they climbed to Runemanse\u0027s highest level. \u0027The topmost fang of the aerie,\u0027 she told him without looking back. \u0027We\u0027ll start there, and work our way down.\u0027\n \u0027Why did you ask after Sunside?\u0027 Nathan was curious.\n \u0027Because you were making conversation,\u0027 she answered. \u0027If I had not answered, Maglore would have made me. He admires that such as you and I are civil towards each other. It pleases him that within the limits he imposes we govern our own bodies and minds, and that we temper ourselves and are matched on an emotional level - unlike vampires, who are commanded by powerful, alien urges to argue and fight at every opportunity, often for the sake of it!\u0027\n \u0027Is that the only reason?\u0027 They had arrived at the topmost landing.\n \u0027No, for it was also my thought to ask ... after the children.\u0027 She waited for him to step up beside her.\n The children?\u0027\n \u0027My life on Sunside was hard,\u0027 she said, \u0027but I remember the little ones. They were sweet, pure, innocent.\u0027\n Nathan shrugged. \u0027All young things are.\u0027\n \u0027Ah, no!\u0027 she answered with a small shudder. The young of the Wamphyri are not...\u0027\n \u0027And are there young ones here?\u0027\n \u0027In Runemanse? No. Maglore cannot abide them. But when I asked him once for a child, he showed me the nurseries of the Wamphyri. The children of Sunside take milk from their mothers or wet-nurses, but in Tur-gosheim . .. they take other than milk. If Maglore could be sure he would father other than a vampire, then he might give me my child, but until then he won\u0027t spoil me for the sake of \"some usurper brat!\u0027\"\n \u0027You asked Maglore for a child?\u0027 Nathan couldn\u0027t believe it. \u0027Do you mean ... you wanted to bear his child?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she answered, leading the way through a labyrinth of empty rooms to one with a window and, set back in an alcove, a curtained area. There, for the first time, she looked Nathan full in the face. But her chin was raised and her eyes defiant. \u0027You have not seen Maglore when he\u0027s young. You\u0027re not a woman. You do not know what it is to be with a vampire Lord. You have no understanding of the word \"fulfilment\".\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Nathan replied, drawing back from her. \u0027But I have seen what remains after women have been ... fulfilled! And if they\u0027re not dead, they\u0027re doomed!\u0027\n She nodded, looked away. \u0027Yes, you are right. But with me ... Maglore has been careful, and gentle. I am not changed. Or if I am, it is that I hated him and now love him. A woman can be in thrall to a man in more ways than one.\u0027\n \u0027You actually love him?\u0027 It seemed impossible.\n \u0027I love Maglore!\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Not his works or the thing inside him, but him!\u0027\n It was beyond understanding. For a moment, lost for words, Nathan shook his head. Then he said: \u0027But surely, it\u0027s his vampire that makes him what he is?\u0027\n \u0027And that is the paradox,\u0027 she answered, \u0027which tears me like rotten cloth. I hate that thing inside Maglore as much as I love its host! For where he is my master, it is his master! And I am jealous of it and hate it because it shares him with me. Also, it shares me with him! But when he is with me in the guise of a young man, then I cannot help but love him.\u0027\n Nathan had backed up to the curtained alcove; Orlea had followed and was standing close to him, with her hand on the curtain rope, when he said, \u0027I think ... that I pity you!\u0027 He spoke before considering his words, perhaps without even meaning them; for he had no way of knowing what her life had been like before Rune-manse. It was simply an expression of his horror. But whatever else she\u0027d lost, Orlea still had her pride. Her dark eyes blazed as she told him:\n \u0027Save your pity for yourself, Nathan, for you\u0027ve not yet seen Runemanse.\u0027 With which she pulled the rope. The curtains swished open, and Nathan saw ... Mag-lore\u0027s siphoneer. At first he did not recognize what he was looking at, but then he did, and staggered away grimacing and gasping.\n \u0027So you see,\u0027 she let the curtains fall and followed him, taking his arm to steady him, \u0027there are times when it\u0027s useful to have someone to love and cling to in a place like this. Aye, even a thing like Maglore.\u0027 Looking into her eyes, Nathan saw nothing of the feral yellow of a thrall\u0027s evil intelligence, or the scarlet of tumultuous Wamphyri passions. But perhaps he did see something of the vacancy of madness ...\n Next on her list, Orlea showed Nathan Maglore\u0027s study or \u0027room of meditation\u0027, to which only a few trusted thralls had access. His eyes were drawn at once to a heavy golden model of the Seer Lord\u0027s sigil upon a slender onyx base, and he wondered at its use; or perhaps it was merely ornamental. And seated for long hours before a marvellous model of Turgosheim, he absorbed what Orlea told him of the vampire gorge. This was a great deal more than he\u0027d learned from Nicolae Seersthrall, and went a long way towards completing his knowledge of the geography of the place and the history of its inhabitants. More than two-thirds of Sundown had passed by the time they were finished there.\n \u0027Are you tired?\u0027 she asked him. \u0027Or do you wish to continue?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know if I am tired,\u0027 Nathan answered truthfully. There\u0027s so much to see, learn. And what I\u0027ve seen already will keep me awake, I\u0027m sure. Anyway, I need to be fatigued in body as well as mind, to sleep soundly.\u0027 But inside he knew that he really should sleep, and do as much of it as possible, at every opportunity. For if he should allow himself to become overtired, sooner or later he would let his guard down. His secret talents must remain secret; his knowledge of the Thyre and their desert places was a trust he could never break; he must see about the fabrication of a false geography and lifestyle for that olden Sunside in the west, which he\u0027d left so far behind. For eventually Maglore would want to know about it, he was sure.\n \u0027Now would be a good time for sleeping,\u0027 Orlea told him as if reading his thoughts, though in fact she had not, for he kept them guarded and could sense nothing of telepathy in her. \u0027For the deep sleep which you require, if you\u0027d stay strong in Runemanse. Fear saps your strength here - everyone\u0027s strength, except Mag-lore\u0027s. One\u0027s nerves are stretched to breaking point; breathing and heartbeat fluctuate; will withers to a husk, even as Maglore\u0027s grows stronger. For it\u0027s not only blood that vampires suck, Nathan. They suck everything.\u0027\n He followed her back down to the great hall, where there was little of activity now. Several female thralls were still out and about, however, and a group of them stood in secretive conversation. Seeing Nathan and Orlea together they fell silent, frowning, and apparently frustrated. Then, when he would have made for his room, Orlea took his elbow and guided him in a different direction, down a passageway carved in pumice.\n \u0027Where are we going?\u0027 Nathan inquired.\n \u0027To a place where those women won\u0027t bother you,\u0027 she told him. \u0027For they fear me almost as much as they fear Maglore.\u0027\n \u0027And where is the Seer Lord now?\u0027 He felt uneasy, but was not quite sure why he wanted to know.\n \u0027Asleep,\u0027 she answered. \u0027He has his routines. This is one of the times when he sleeps. Sunup will rouse him from his bed, when he\u0027ll retreat to his workshops in the lower levels. Unlike the other Lords, most of which work only at night and cower in the dark when the sun stands on high over Sunside, Maglore has regulated his sleeping evenly between day and night.\u0027\n They reached the outer wall where a narrow window looked towards the north-east, and stone steps spiralled down around a mortared stone core. At the bottom was a lesser hall like a warren, with passages leading off. She led the way down one of these to a room with a door like Nathan\u0027s. It was Orlea\u0027s room, but inside ... the door was fitted with a bolt. This wasn\u0027t the only difference, for her apartment was very well appointed. She had a bath, furniture, furs on the floor, and tasselled drapes at a tiny window punched through the massive wall; and her bed was curtained with gauzy drapes, which hung to the floor from rails between the posters.\n There were several gas jets with low yellow flames. She went about the room plugging them with bone dowels, until the light was reduced to a smoky dusk. And as Nathan\u0027s imagination began to run rampant, she said: \u0027No one will bother you here. Here you may sleep safely.\u0027\n \u0027Orlea,\u0027 he headed for the door, \u0027I appreciate your concern for me, but I fear that if Maglore knew I was here...\u0027\n \u0027He does,\u0027 she cut him short, stopped him in his tracks. \u0027Do you think I would dare if he did not? He ordered it.\u0027\n Mind whirling and senses numb, Nathan faced the door, his hand reaching for the bolt. But hearing the rustle of curtains, he turned and looked back. Her clothes lay where she\u0027d tossed them on a stool beside the bed, and the drapes were still mobile, shivering into stillness.\n Tingling with an electric awareness, scarcely daring to breathe, Nathan asked, \u0027What... did he order?\u0027\n \u0027Everything,\u0027 her voice came back to him, very small and somehow sad. \u0027I\u0027m to take your innocence, until there\u0027s nothing left for them.\u0027\n \u0027His vampire women?\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\n He went back to the bed. \u0027Orlea, I know better now. I know that I\u0027m to avoid them, which in turn makes this unnecessary.\u0027\n \u0027Do you spurn me and defy Maglore?\u0027\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t spurn you,\u0027 he said, trying hard to make her understand, without belittling himself. But in the end he knew there was only one way, which was to tell the truth. \u0027It\u0027s just that I have no experience of women,\u0027 he finally blurted it out. \u0027I don\u0027t know ... anything!\u0027\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she answered, \u0027and weren\u0027t we all innocent, upon a time?\u0027\n Even as she spoke, Nathan\u0027s ringers were trembling as if they were some other\u0027s where they removed his clothes. \u0027I mean it,\u0027 he said. \u0027I really don\u0027t know anything at all.\u0027 Even now it wasn\u0027t the whole truth, but close enough.\n \u0027But you will,\u0027 she whispered, \u0027you will. Even as I know, so shall you.\u0027\n He was naked. \u0027Orlea, I...\"\n \u0027Come to bed and warm me,\u0027 she told him. \u0027At least I\u0027ll know that there\u0027s only one of you, that your actions are your own and not directed by some other. At least it will be you, and not some slimy-black thing inside that drives you on.\u0027\n He passed through the curtains to where her slender hand greeted him. She turned back the covers and he slid in beside her. She covered him with the blankets, then with her strange cold love ...\n Later, in the dusk of the curtained bed and the musk of their bodies, Nathan asked: \u0027How did you come here?\u0027\n \u0027I was a child on Sunside,\u0027 Orlea told him, \u0027just fourteen years old, when the headman of my village, Gobor Tulcini, noticed me. He was a brutal man, Gobor, with a frail and much abused wife. But then, he abused everything: his position, his people - phah! - the very air he breathed. Why, wild dogs are better behaved! One tithe time, he engineered a deficiency, and at the last moment chose my father to make up the number. After my father was taken, my poor mother died of grief. Then Gobor took me into his house, so that he might \"bring me up as his own\". So he said ...\n \u0027My duties were to look after the village children, which I loved. For after all, I was only a child myself. But while I looked after them, Gobor ... looked after me. His wife knew but feared him terribly, and so made no complaint. Twice in a year, by his order, she helped me lose the child he had made in me.\n \u0027I bided my time, until I could stand it no longer. Then, one night when the tithesmen came out of Tur-gosheim, I crept to the square and offered myself for the taking. Gobor would have snatched me back and beaten me, but a lieutenant, seeing that I was more comely than some of the girls on offer, questioned me. I told him my mother was dead and my father had been taken by the Wamphyri, and Gobor had kept me for himself, out of sight of the tithesmen. Well, the truth was that I was too young for the tithe, but most of what I said was true.\n \u0027Also, I said that I vastly preferred Turgosheim to the great brute Gobor, which was the whole truth. Even death was preferable, though that was not the entire reason. But being a child and still nai\u0027ve - in my thinking, at least - I also thought I might find my father here. And despite that I was young, I was brought into Turgosheim.\n \u0027Luckily, a man of Maglore\u0027s drew me in the fatesay-ing, and so I came here. I had learned the ways of men from Gobor, and used a woman\u0027s wiles on Maglore. He was fascinated to know how I, a child, was such a woman. And when he knew ... then he arranged for men of his to be tithesmen for a spell, going into Sunside to collect the pitiful human tribute of the Szgany. And he instructed his men to choose a new leader for the people of my village, and to bring Gobor back with them. Thus the great brute met his end in the provisioning of the Lord Vormulac\u0027s melancholy Vormspire, which I believe was my father\u0027s fate before him ...\u0027\n As she finished her story Nathan slipped out of bed and began to dress himself. She watched him through the curtains a while, then said, \u0027You don\u0027t have to go.\u0027\n \u0027But I do have my own place here,\u0027 he told her, \u0027which I had better get used to.\u0027\n \u0027As you wish. And there will be another time, when you will be more at ease. Then I\u0027ll show you the things you still don\u0027t know.\u0027\n \u0027By Maglore\u0027s command?\u0027 Even as he said it, Nathan knew that it was churlish of him. Especially now that he knew what her life had been. But with the words already out, it was too late to make amends.\n And after a moment she answered quietly, \u0027Maybe ... and maybe not. We all must do as we\u0027re told, but the way in which we do it is our own concern ...\u0027\n He left and made his way to his room. There were several vampire thralls in the great hall, a handful of women and one or two males. The latter glanced at Nathan, perhaps enviously, but he was pleased to note that the females ignored him. They had learned Mag-lore\u0027s lesson. And anyway, he was no longer an innocent. Oh, he was, in many ways, but not in that way. That part of him was gone forever.\n In one way he felt more the man, but in another he felt dejected, made small. And he remembered what his mother Nana had used to tell him when he\u0027d been hunting, that good meat is always the tastiest when you\u0027ve caught it yourself ...\n From then on time passed quickly, and as Nathan got to know Runemanse, so its menace receded a little, but never entirely. And Orlea had been right: there were times when he would wake up in the night (even during the long days), with his nerves screaming and his heart pounding in his chest. It was simply the knowledge that terror and morbid works were all around, and that every other creature in Runemanse, and indeed Turgosheim, was a plague-bearing vampire. With the sole exception of Orlea herself.\n And as for Orlea: she was as good as her word and showed Nathan those things he still didn\u0027t know. She took him to her room a second time, and on a third and final occasion he made his own way there by prior arrangement. And again he saw how she had been right, for he was more at ease and pleased to take the initiative. Being young and potent, he enjoyed her slender body and might easily have fallen in love with her, except she warned him against it.\n \u0027I am Maglore\u0027s,\u0027 she told him, when on that third occasion he proved hard to drive from her room. \u0027And I have done my duty by him and obeyed his orders.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe,\u0027 he said, at her door. \u0027But you\u0027ve loved me anyway, and you found it pleasant.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-world-i-blood-brothers-necroscope-6/page-27.html","bookId":2452,"book":{"id":2452,"title":"Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire World I: Blood Brothers (Necroscope #6) \n The vampires have been vanquished!
