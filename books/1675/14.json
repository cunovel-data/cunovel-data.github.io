Aliens were so fascinated by them that they decided to gather them all up and take them to their own planet.”\\n\\n Henri shakes his head. “I didn’t know that,” he says. “Did you know that the Loch Ness monster was really an animal from the planet Trafalgra? They brought him here as an experiment, to see if he could survive, and he did. But when he was discovered the aliens had to take him back, which is why he was never spotted again.”\\n\\n I laugh, not at the theory, but at the name Trafalgra. There is no planet named Trafalgra and I wonder if Henri has made it up on the fly.\\n\\n “Did you know the Egyptian pyramids were built by aliens?”\\n\\n “I’ve heard that,” Henri says, smiling. This is funny to him because though the pyramids weren’t actually built by aliens, they were built using Lorien knowledge and with Lorien help. “Did you know the world is supposed to end on December 21, 2012?”\\n\\n Sam nods and grins. “Yeah, I’ve heard that. Earth’s supposed expiration date, the end of the Mayan calendar.”\\n\\n “Expiration date?” I chime in. “Like, a ‘best if used before’ date that’s printed on milk cartons? Is Earth going to curdle?”\\n\\n I laugh at my own joke, but Sam and Henri pay me no attention.\\n\\n Then Sam says, “Did you know crop circles were originally used as a navigational tool for the Agharian alien race? But that was thousands of years ago. Today they are only created by bored farmers.”\\n\\n I laugh again. I have the urge to ask what sorts of people create alien conspiracies if it is bored farmers who create crop circles, but I don’t.\\n\\n “How about the Centuri?” asks Henri. “Do you know of them?”\\n\\n Sam shakes his head.\\n\\n “They’re a race of aliens living at Earth’s core. They are a contentious race, in constant discord with one another, and when they have civil wars Earth’s surface is thrown off-kilter. That’s when things such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The tsunami of 2004? All because the Centuri king’s daughter went missing.”\\n\\n “Did they find her?” I ask.\\n\\n Henri shakes his head, looks at me, then back at Sam, who is still smiling at the game. “They never did. Theorists believe she is able to shift her shape, and that she is living somewhere in South America.”\\n\\n Henri’s theory is so good, I think there’s no way he made it up that quickly. I stand there and actually ponder it, even though I’ve never heard of aliens called the Centuri, even when I know for a fact that nothing lives at Earth’s core.\\n\\n “Did you know…” Sam pauses. I think Henri has stumped him, and as soon as that thought pops into my mind Sam says something so frightening that a wave of terror shoots through me.\\n\\n “Did you know that the Mogadorians are on a quest for universal domination, and that they have already wiped out one planet and are planning to wipe Earth out next? They’re here seeking human weakness so that they can exploit us when the war begins.”\\n\\n My mouth drops open and Henri stares at Sam, dumbfounded. He’s holding his breath. His hand tightens around his coffee cup until I’m afraid that if it tightens any further the cup will crumple. Sam glances at Henri, then at me.\\n\\n “You guys look like you’ve seen a ghost. Does this mean I win?”\\n\\n “Where did you hear that?” I ask. Henri looks at me so fiercely that I wish I had remained silent.\\n\\n “From They Walk Among Us.”\\n\\n Henri still can’t think of how to respond. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes. Then a petite woman standing behind Sam interrupts.\\n\\n “Sam,” she says. He turns and looks at her. “Where have you been?”\\n\\n Sam shrugs. “I was standing right here.”\\n\\n She sighs, then says to Henri, “Hi, I’m Sam’s mother.”\\n\\n “Henri,” he says, and shakes her hand. “Pleased to meet you.”\\n\\n She opens her eyes in surprise. Something in Henri’s accent has excited her.\\n\\n “Ah bon! Vous parlez français? C’est super! J’ai personne avec qui je peux parler français depuis long-temps.”\\n\\n Henri smiles. “I’m sorry. I don’t actually speak French. I know my accent sounds like it, though.”\\n\\n “No?” She is disappointed. “Well hell, here I thought some dignity had finally come to town.”\\n\\n Sam looks at me and rolls his eyes.\\n\\n “All right, Sam, let’s get going,” she says.\\n\\n He shrugs. “You guys gonna go to the park and the hayride?”\\n\\n I look at Henri, then at Sam. “Yeah, sure,” I say. “Are you?”\\n\\n He shrugs.\\n\\n “Well, try to come meet us if you can,” I say.\\n\\n He smiles and nods. “Okay, cool.”\\n\\n “Time to go, Sam. And you might not be able to go on the hayride. I need your help at home,” his mother says. He starts to say something but she walks away. Sam follows her.\\n\\n “Very nice woman,” Henri says sarcastically.\\n\\n “How did you make all that up?” I ask.\\n\\n The crowd begins migrating up Main Street, away from the circle. Henri and I follow it up to the park, where cider and food are being served.\\n\\n “You lie long enough and you start to get used to it.”\\n\\n I nod. “So what do you think?”\\n\\n He takes a deep breath and exhales. The temperature is cold enough so that I can see his breath. “I have no idea. I don’t know what to think at this point. He caught me off guard.”\\n\\n “He caught us both off guard.”\\n\\n “We’re going to have to look into the publication he’s getting his information from, find out who is writing it and where it’s being written.”\\n\\n He looks over at me expectantly.\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “You’re going to have to get a copy,” he says.\\n\\n “I will,” I say. “But still, it makes no sense. How could somebody know that?”\\n\\n “It’s being supplied from somewhere.”\\n\\n “Do you think it’s one of us?”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “Do you think it’s them?”\\n\\n “It could be. I’ve never thought to check the conspiracy-theory rags. Perhaps they think we read them and can root us out by leaking information like that. I mean…” He pauses, thinks about it for a minute. “Hell, John, I don’t know. We’ll have to look into it, though. It’s not a coincidence, that’s for sure.”\\n\\n We walk in silence, still a little stunned, turning possible explanations over in our minds. Bernie Kosar trots along between us, tongue dangling, his cape falling to one side and dragging on the sidewalk. He’s a big hit with the kids and many of them stop us to pet him.\\n\\n The park is situated on the southern edge of town. At the far border are two adjacent lakes separated by a narrow strip of land leading into the forest beyond them. The park itself is made up of three baseball fields, a playground, and a large pavilion where volunteers serve cider and slices of pumpkin pie. Three hay wagons are off to the side of the gravel drive, with a large sign reading:\\n\\n BE SCARED OUT OF YOUR WITS!\\n\\n HALLOWEEN HAUNTED HAYRIDES\\n\\n START @ SUNDOWN\\n\\n $5 PER PERSON\\n\\n The drive segues from gravel to dirt before it reaches the woods, the entrance to which is decorated with cutouts of ghost and goblin caricatures. It appears that the haunted hayride travels through the woods. I look around for Sarah but don’t see her anywhere. I wonder if she’ll be going on it.\\n\\n Henri and I enter the pavilion. The cheerleaders are off to the side, some of them doing Halloween-themed face paintings for the kids, the others selling raffle tickets for the drawing to be held at six p.m.\\n\\n “Hi, John,” I hear behind me. I turn around and there’s Sarah, holding her camera. “How did you like the parade?”\\n\\n I smile at her and slide my hands into my pockets. There’s a small white ghost painted on her cheek.\\n\\n “Hey, you,” I say. “I liked it. I’m think I’m getting used to this small-town Ohio charm.”\\n\\n “Charm? You mean boringness, right?”\\n\\n I shrug. “I don’t know, it isn’t bad.”\\n\\n “Hey, it’s the little guy from school. I remember you,” she says, bending down to pet Bernie Kosar. He wags his tail wildly, jumps up and tries to lick her face. Sarah laughs. I look over my shoulder. Henri is twenty feet away, talking to Sarah’s mom at one of the picnic tables. I’m curious to know what they’re talking about.\\n\\n “I think he likes you. His name is Bernie Kosar.”\\n\\n “Bernie Kosar? That’s no name for an adorable dog. Look at this cape. It’s, like, cute overload.”\\n\\n “You know if you keep that up I’m going to be jealous of my own dog,” I say.\\n\\n She smiles and stands.\\n\\n “So are you going to buy a raffle ticket from me or what? It’s to rebuild a not-for-profit animal shelter destroyed in a fire last month in Colorado.”\\n\\n “Really? How does a girl from Paradise, Ohio, learn of an animal shelter in Colorado?”\\n\\n “It’s my aunt’s. I’ve convinced all the girls on the cheerleading squad to participate. We’re going to take a trip and assist in the construction. We’ll be helping the animals and getting out of school and Ohio for a week. It’s a win-win situation.”\\n\\n I picture Sarah dressed in a hard hat, wielding a hammer. The thought brings a grin to my face. “So you’re saying I’m going to have to cover the kitchen alone for a whole week?” I fake an exasperated sigh and shake my head. “I don’t know if I can support such a trip now, even if it is for the animals.”\\n\\n She laughs and punches me in the arm. I take out my wallet and give her five dollars for six tickets.\\n\\n “These six are good luck,” she says.\\n\\n “They are?”\\n\\n “Of course. You bought them from me, silly.”\\n\\n Just then, over Sarah’s shoulder, I see Mark and the rest of the guys from the float walk into the pavilion.\\n\\n “Are you going on the haunted hayride tonight?” Sarah asks.\\n\\n “Yeah, I was thinking about it.”\\n\\n “You should, it’s fun. Everybody does it. And it actually gets pretty scary.”\\n\\n Mark sees Sarah and me talking and scrunches his face into a scowl. He comes walking our way. Same outfit as always—letterman jacket, blue jeans, hair full of gel.\\n\\n “So you’re going?” I ask Sarah.\\n\\n Before she can respond Mark interrupts. “How’d you like the parade, Johnny?” he asks. Sarah quickly turns around and glares at him.\\n\\n “I liked it a lot,” I reply.\\n\\n “You going on the haunted hayride tonight, or are you going to be too scared?”\\n\\n I smile at him. “As a matter of fact, I am going.”\\n\\n “You going to have a freak-out like in school and run out of the woods crying like a baby?”\\n\\n “Don’t be an ass, Mark,” Sarah says. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/i-am-number-four-lorien-legacies-1/page-14.html","bookId":1675,"book":{"id":1675,"title":"I Am Number Four (Lorien Legacies #1)","description":"Storyline: I Am Number Four (Lorien Legacies #1) \\n In the beginning they were a group of nine.
