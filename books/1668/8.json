Done by! Gum by! In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone, And meat was hard to come by. Up came Tom with his big boots on. Said he to Troll: \u0027Pray, what is yon? For it looks like the shin o\u0027 roy nuncle Tim, As should be a-lyin\u0027 in graveyard. Caveyard! Paveyard! This many a year has Tim been gone, And I thought he were lyin\u0027 in graveyard\u0027. \u0027My lad\u0027, said Troll, \u0027this bone I stole. But what be bones that lie in a hole? Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o\u0027 lead, Afore I found his shinbone. Tinbone! Thinbone! He can spare a share for a poor old troll; For he don\u0027t need his shinbone\u0027. Said Tom: \u0027I don\u0027t see why the likes o\u0027 thee Without axin\u0027 leave should go makin\u0027 free With the shank or the shin o\u0027 my father\u0027s kin; So hand the old bone over! Rover! Trover! Though dead he be, it belongs to he; So hand the old bone over!\u0027 \u0027For a couple o\u0027 pins\u0027, says Troll, and grins, \u0027I\u0027ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins. A bit o\u0027 fresh meat will go down sweet! I\u0027ll try my teeth on thee now. ���֧� now! See now! I\u0027m tired o\u0027 gnawing old bones and skins; I\u0027ve a mind to dine on thee now\u0027. But just as he thought his dinner was caught, He found his hands had hold of naught. Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind And gave him the boot to larn him. Warn him! Darn him! A bump o\u0027 the boot on the seat, Tom thought, Would be the way to larn him. But harder than stone is the flesh and bone Of a troll that sits in the hills alone. As well set your boot to the mountain\u0027s root, For the seat of a troll don\u0027t feel it. Peel it! Heal it! Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan, And he knew his toes could feel it. Tom\u0027s leg is game, since home he came, And his bootless foot is lasting lame; But Troll don\u0027t care, and he\u0027s still there With the bone he boned from its owner. Doner! Boner! Troll\u0027s old seat is still the same, And the bone he boned from its owner!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-8.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
