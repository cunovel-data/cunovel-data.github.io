You sink into the slime, who dare To knock upon their door, While down the grinning gargoyles stare And noisome waters pour. Beside the rotting river-strand The drooping willows weep, And gloomily the gorcrows stand Croaking in their sleep. Over the Merlock Mountains a long and weary way, In a mouldy valley where the trees are grey, By a dark pool\u0027s borders without wind or tide, Moonless and sunless, the Mewlips hide. The cellars where the Mewlips sit Are deep and dank and cold With single sickly candle lit; And there they count their gold. Their walls are wet, their ceilings drip; Their feet upon the floor Go softly with a squish-flap-flip, As they sidle to the door. They peep out slyly; through a crack Their feeling fingers creep, And when they\u0027ve finished, in a sack Your bones they lake to keep. Beyond the Merlock Mountains, a long and lonely road. Through the spider-shadows and the marsh of Tode, And through the wood of hanging trees and the gallows-weed, You go to find the Mewlips �C and the Mewlips feed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-10.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
