Of moth-web light All moonlit-white She wore a woven coat, And round her kirtle Was bound a girdle Sewn with diamond dew. She walked by day Under mantle grey And hood of clouded blue; But she went by night All glittering bright Under the starlit sky, And her slippers frail Of fishes\u0027 mail Flashed as she went by To her dancing-pool, And on mirror cool Of windless water played. As a mist of light In whirling flight A glint like glass she made Wherever her feet Of silver fleet Flicked the dancing-floor. She looked on high To the roofless sky, And she looked to the shadowy shore; Then round she went, And her eyes she bent And saw beneath her go A Princess Shee As fair as Mee: They were dancing toe to toe! Shee was as light As Mee, and as bright; But Shee was, strange to tell, Hanging down With starry crown Into a bottomless well! Her gleaming eyes In great surprise Looked up to the eyes of Mee: A marvellous thing, Head-down to swing Above a starry sea! Only their feet Could ever meet; For where the ways might lie To find a land Where they do not stand But hang down in the sky No one could tell Nor learn in spell In all the elven-lore. So still on her own An elf alone Dancing as before With pearls in hair And kirtle fair And slippers frail Of fishes\u0027 mail went Mee: Of fishes\u0027 mail And slippers frail And kirtle fair With pearls in hair went Shee!","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-5.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
