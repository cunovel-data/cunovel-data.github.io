He heard them not.\n A voice echoed in his deep grot:\n a young warrior with a bright sword\n called him forth to defend his hoard.\n His teeth were knives, and of horn his hide,\n but iron tore him, and his flame died.\n There was an old king on a high throne:\n his white beard lay on knees of bone;\n his mouth savoured neither meat nor drink,\n nor his ears song; he could only think\n of his huge chest with carven lid\n where pale gems and gold lay hid\n in secret treasury in the dark ground;\n its strong doors were iron-bound.\n The swords of his thanes were dull with rust,\n his glory fallen, his rule unjust,\n his halls hollow, and his bowers cold,\n but king he was of elvish gold.\n He heard not the horns in the mountain-pass,\n he smelt not the blood on the trodden grass,\n but his halls were burned, his kingdom lost;\n in a cold pit his bones were tossed.\n There is an old hoard in a dark rock,\n forgotten behind doors none can unlock;\n that grim gate no man can pass.\n On the mound grows the green grass;\n there sheep feed and the larks soar,\n and the wind blows from the sea-shore.\n The old hoard the Night shall keep,\n while earth waits and the Elves sleep. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-15.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: \n The Adventures of Tom Bombadil \n by J.R.R.
