My folk are gone beyond recall and take no thought of me; alone I\u0027m left, the last of all from Weathertop to the Sea\u0027. \u0027I steal no gold, I drink no beer, I eat no kind of meat; but People slam their doors in fear, whenever they hear my feet. O how I wish that they were neat, and my hands were not so rough! Yet my heart is soft, my smile is sweet, and my cooking good enough.\u0027 \u0027Come, come!\u0027 he thought, \u0027this will not do! I must go and find a friend; a-walking soft I\u0027ll wander through the Shire from end to end\u0027. Down he went, and he walked all night with his feet in boots of fur; to Delving he came in the morning light, when folk were just astir. He looked around, and who did he meet but old Mrs. Bunce and all with umbrella and basket walking the street; and he smiled and stopped to call: \u0027Good morning, ma\u0027am! Good day to you! I hope I find you well?\u0027 But she dropped umbrella and basket too, and yelled a frightful yell. Old Pott the Mayor was strolling near; when he heard that awful sound, he turned all purple and pink with fear, and dived down underground. The Lonely Troll was hurt and sad: \u0027Don\u0027t go!\u0027 he gently said, but old Mrs. Bunce ran home like mad and hid beneath her bed. The Troll went on to the market-place and peeped above the stalls; the sheep went wild when they saw his face, and the geese flew over the walls. Old Farmer Hogg he spilled his ale, Bill Butcher threw a knife, and Grip his dog, he turned his tail and ran to save his life. The old Troll sadly sat and wept outside the Lockholes gate, and Perry-the-Winkle up he crept and patted him on the pate. \u0027O why do you weep, you great big lump? You\u0027re better outside than in!\u0027 He gave the Troll a friendly thump, and laughed to see him grin. \u0027O Perry-the-Winkle boy\u0027, he cried, \u0027come, you\u0027re the lad for me! Now if you\u0027re willing to take a ride, I\u0027ll carry you home to tea\u0027. He jumped on his back and held on tight, and \u0027Off you go!\u0027 said he; and the Winkle had a feast that night, and sat on the old Troll\u0027s knee. There were pikelets, there was buttered toast, and jam, and cream, and cake, and the Winkle strove to eat the most, though his buttons all should break. The kettle sang, the fire was hot, the pot was large and brown, and the Winkle tried to drink the lot, in tea though he should drown. When full and tight were coat and skin, they rested without speech, till the old Troll said: \u0027I\u0027ll now begin the baker\u0027s art to teach, the making of beautiful cramsome bread, of bannocks light and brown; and then you can sleep on a heather-bed with pillows of owlets\u0027 down\u0027. \u0027Young Winkle, where\u0027ve you been?\u0027 they said. \u0027I\u0027ve been to a fulsome tea, and I feel so fat, for I have fed on cramsome bread\u0027, said he. \u0027But where, my lad, in the Shire was that? Or out in Bree?\u0027 said they. But Winkle he up and answered flat: \u0027I aint a-going to say\u0027. \u0027But I know where\u0027, said Peeping Jack, \u0027I watched him ride away: he went upon the old Troll\u0027s back to the hills of Faraway\u0027. Then all the People went with a will, by pony, cart, or moke, until they came to a house in a hill and saw a chimney smoke. They hammered upon the old Troll\u0027s door. \u0027A beautiful cramsome cake O bake for us, please, or two, or more; O bake!\u0027 they cried, \u0027O bake!\u0027 \u0027Go home, go home!\u0027 the old Troll said. \u0027I never invited you. Only on Thursdays I bake my bread, and only for a few\u0027. \u0027Go home! Go home! There\u0027s some mistake. My house is far too small; and I\u0027ve no pikelets, cream, or cake: the Winkle has eaten all! You Jack, and Hogg, old Bunce and Pott I wish no more to see. Be off! Be off now all the lot! The Winkle\u0027s the boy for me!\u0027 Now Perry-the-Winkle grew so fat through eating of cramsome bread, his weskit bust, and never a hat would sit upon his head; for Every Thursday he went to tea, and sat on the kitchen floor, and smaller the old Troll seemed to be, as he grew more and more. The Winkle a Baker great became, as still is said in song; from the Sea to Bree there went the fame of his bread both short and long. But it weren\u0027t so good as the cramsome bread; no butter so rich and free, as Every Thursday the old Troll spread for Perry-the-Winkle\u0027s tea.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-9.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
