I\u0027ll take it when me pleases.\\n\\n This day I\u0027ll mend my boat and journey as it chances\\n\\n west down the withy-stream, following my fancies!\u0027\\n\\n Little Bird sat on twig. \u0027Whillo, Tom! I heed you.\\n\\n I\u0027ve a guess, I\u0027ve a guess where your fancies lead you.\\n\\n Shall I go, shall I go, bring him word to meet you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No names, you tell-tale, or I\u0027ll skin and eat you,\\n\\n babbling in every ear things that don\u0027t concern you!\\n\\n If you tell Willow-man where I\u0027ve gone, I\u0027ll burn you,\\n\\n roast you on a willow-spit. That\u0027ll end your prying!\u0027\\n\\n Willow-wren cocked her tail, piped as she went flying:\\n\\n \u0027Catch me first, catch me first! No names are needed.\\n\\n I\u0027ll perch on his hither ear: the message will be heeded.\\n\\n \"Down by Mithe\", I\u0027ll say, \"just as sun is sinking\"\\n\\n Hurry up, hurry up! That\u0027s the time for drinking!\u0027\\n\\n Tom laughed to himself: \u0027Maybe then I\u0027ll go there.\\n\\n I might go by other ways, but today I\u0027ll row there.\u0027\\n\\n He shaved oars, patched his boat; from hidden creek he hauled her\\n\\n through reed and sallow-brake, under leaning alder,\\n\\n then down the river went, singing: \u0027Silly-sallow,\\n\\n Flow withy-willow-stream over deep and shallow!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whee! Tom Bombadil! Whither be you going,\\n\\n bobbing in a cockle-boat, down the river rowing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe to Brandywine along the Withywindle;\\n\\n maybe friends of mine fire for me will kindle\\n\\n down by the Hays-end. Little folk I know there,\\n\\n kind at the day\u0027s end. Now and then I go there\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Take word to my kin, bring me back their tidings!\\n\\n Tell me of diving pools and the fishes\u0027 hidings!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nay then,\u0027 said Bombadil, \u0027I am only rowing\\n\\n just to smell the water like, not on errands going\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Tee hee! Cocky Tom! Mind your tub don\u0027t founder!\\n\\n Look out for willow-snags! I\u0027d laugh to see you flounder\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Talk less, Fisher Blue! Keep your kindly wishes!\\n\\n Fly off and preen yourself with the bones of fishes!\\n\\n Gay lord on your bough, at home a dirty varlet\\n\\n living in a sloven house, though your breast be scarlet.\\n\\n I\u0027ve heard of fisher-birds beak in air a-dangling\\n\\n to show how the wind is set: that\u0027s an end of angling!\u0027\\n\\n The King\u0027s fisher shut his beak, winked his eye, as singing\\n\\n Tom passed under bough. Flash! then he went winging;\\n\\n dropped down jewel-blue a feather, and Tom caught it\\n\\n gleaming in a sun-ray: a pretty gift he thought it.\\n\\n He stuck it in his tall hat, the old feather casting:\\n\\n \u0027Blue now for Tom\u0027, he said, \"a merry hue and lasting!\u0027\\n\\n Rings swirled round his boat, he saw the bubbles quiver.\\n\\n Tom slapped his oar, smack! at a shadow in the river.\\n\\n \u0027Hoosh! Tom Bombadil! \u0027Tis long since last I met you.\\n\\n Turned water-boatman, eh? What if I upset you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? Why, Whisker-lad, I\u0027d ride you down the river.\\n\\n My fingers on your back would set your hide a-shiver.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Pish, Tom Bombadil! I\u0027ll go and tell my mother;\\n\\n \"Call all our kin to come, father, sister, brother!\\n\\n Tom\u0027s gone mad as a coot with wooden legs: he\u0027s paddling\\n\\n down Withywindle stream, an old tub a-straddling!\"\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll give your otter-fell to Barrow-wights. They\u0027ll taw you!\\n\\n Then smother you in gold-rings! Your mother if she saw you,\\n\\n she\u0027d never know her son, unless \u0027twas by a whisker.\\n\\n Nay, don\u0027t tease old Tom, until you be far brisker!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whoosh! said otter-lad, river-water spraying\\n\\n over Tom\u0027s hat and all; set the boat a-swaying,\\n\\n dived down under it, and by the bank lay peering,\\n\\n till Tom\u0027s merry song faded out of hearing.\\n\\n Old Swan of Elvet-isle sailed past him proudly,\\n\\n gave Tom a black look, snorted at him loudly.\\n\\n Tom laughed: \u0027You old cob, do you miss your feather?\\n\\n Give me a new one then! The old was worn by weather.\\n\\n Could you speak a fair word, I would love you dearer:\\n\\n long neck and dumb throat, but still a haughty sneerer!\\n\\n If one day the King returns, in upping he may take you,\\n\\n brand your yellow bill, and less lordly make you!\u0027\\n\\n Old Swan huffed his wings, hissed, and paddled faster;\\n\\n in his wake bobbing on Tom went rowing after.\\n\\n Tom came to Withy-weir. Down the river rushing\\n\\n foamed into Windle-reach, a-bubbling and a-splashing;\\n\\n bore Tom over stone spinning like a windfall,\\n\\n bobbing like a bottle-cork, to the hythe at Grindwall.\\n\\n Hoy! Here\u0027s Woodman Tom with his bill��-beard on!\u0027\\n\\n laughed all the little folk of Hays-end and Breredon.\\n\\n \u0027Ware, Tom\u0027 We\u0027ll shoot you dead with our bows and arrows\u0027\\n\\n We don\u0027t let Forest-folk nor bogies from the Barrows\\n\\n cross over Brandywine by cockle-boat nor ferry\u0027.\\n\\n \u0027Fie, little fatbellies! Don\u0027t ye make so merry!\\n\\n I\u0027ve seen hobbit-folk digging holes to hide \u0027em,\\n\\n frightened if a horny goat or a badger eyed \u0027em,\\n\\n afeared of the moony-beams, their own shadows shunning.\\n\\n I\u0027ll call the orks on you: that\u0027ll send you running!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You may call, Woodman Tom. And you can talk your beard off.\\n\\n Three arrows in your hat! You we\u0027re not afeared of!\\n\\n Where would you go to now? If for beer you\u0027re making,\\n\\n the barrels aint deep enough in Breredon for your slaking!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Away over Brandywine by Shirebourn I\u0027d be going,\\n\\n but too swift for cockle-boat (he river now is flowing.\\n\\n I\u0027d bless little folk that took me in their wherry,\\n\\n wish them evenings fair and many mornings merry\u0027.\\n\\n Red flowed the Brandywine: with flame the river kindled.\\n\\n as sun sank beyond the Shire, and then to grey it dwindled.\\n\\n Mithe Steps empty stood. None was there to greet him.\\n\\n Silent the Causeway lay. Said Tom: \u0027A merry meeting!\u0027\\n\\n Tom slumped along the road, as the light was failing.\\n\\n Rushey lamps gleamed ahead. He heard a voice him hailing.\\n\\n \u0027Whoa there!\u0027 Ponies stopped, wheels halted sliding.\\n\\n Tom went plodding past. never looked beside him.\\n\\n \u0027Ho there! beggarman tramping in the Marish!\\n\\n What\u0027s your business here? Hat all stuck with arrows!\\n\\n Someone\u0027s warned you off, caught you at your sneaking?\\n\\n Come here! Tell me now what it is you\u0027re seeking!\\n\\n Shire-ale. I\u0027ll be bound, though you\u0027ve not a penny.\\n\\n I\u0027ll bid them lock their doors, and then you won\u0027t get any\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, well. Muddy-feet! From one that\u0027s late for meeting\\n\\n away back by the Mithe that\u0027s a surly greeting!\\n\\n You old farmer fat that cannot walk for wheezing,\\n\\n cart-drawn like a sack, ought to be more pleasing.\\n\\n Penny-wise tub-on-legs! A beggar can\u0027t be chooser,\\n\\n or else I\u0027d bid you go, and you would be the loser.\\n\\n Come, Maggot! Help me up! A tankard now you owe me.\\n\\n Even in cockshut light an old friend should know me!\u0027\\n\\n Laughing they drove away, in Rushey never halting,\\n\\n though the inn open stood and they could smell the mailing.\\n\\n They turned down Maggot\u0027s Lane, rattling and bumping,\\n\\n Tom in the farmer\u0027s cart dancing round and jumping.\\n\\n Stars shone on Bamfurlong, and Maggot\u0027s house was lighted;\\n\\n fire in the kitchen burned to welcome the benighted.\\n\\n Maggot\u0027s sons bowed at door, his daughters did their curtsy,\\n\\n his wife brought tankards out for those that might be thirsty.\\n\\n Songs they had and merry tales the supping and the dancing;\\n\\n Goodman Maggot there for all his belt was prancing,\\n\\n Tom did a hornpipe when he was not quaffing,\\n\\n daughters did the Springle-ring, goodwife did the laughing.\\n\\n When others went to bed in hay, fern, or feather,\\n\\n close in the inglenook they laid their heads together,\\n\\n old Tom and Muddy-feet, swapping all the tidings\\n\\n from Barrow-downs to Tower Hills: of walkings and of ridings;\\n\\n of wheat-ear and barley-corn, of sowing and of reaping;\\n\\n queer tales from Bree, and talk at smithy, mill, and cheaping;\\n\\n rumours in whispering trees, south-wind in the larches,\\n\\n tall Watchers by the Ford, Shadows on the marches.\\n\\n Old Maggot slept at last in chair beside the embers.\\n\\n Ere dawn Tom was gone: as dreams one half remembers,\\n\\n some merry, some sad, and some of hidden warning.\\n\\n None heard the door unlocked; a shower of rain at morning\\n\\n his footprints washed away, at Mithe he left no traces,\\n\\n at Hays-end they heard no song nor sound of heavy paces.\\n\\n Three days his boat lay by the hythe at Grindwall,\\n\\n and then one mom was gone back up Withywindle.\\n\\n Otter-folk, hobbits said, came by night and loosed her,\\n\\n dragged her over weir, and up stream they pushed her.\\n\\n Out from Elvet-isle Old Swan came sailing,\\n\\n in beak took her painter up in the water trailing,\\n\\n drew her proudly on; otters swam beside her\\n\\n round old Willow-man\u0027s crooked roots to guide her;\\n\\n the King\u0027s fisher perched on bow, on thwart the wren was singing,\\n\\n merrily the cockle-boat homeward they were bringing.\\n\\n To Tom\u0027s creek they came at last. Otter-lad said: \u0027Whish now!\\n\\n What\u0027s a coot without his legs, or a unless fish now?\u0027\\n\\n O! silly-sallow-willow-stream! The oars they\u0027d left behind them!\\n\\n Long they lay at Grindwall hythe for Tom to come and find them. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-3.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil \\n by J.R.R.
