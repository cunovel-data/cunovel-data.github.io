Not a man did he meet,\n no voice was raised in song;\n There were snores instead, for all folk were abed\n and still would slumber long.\n He knocked as he passed on doors locked fast,\n and called and cried in vain,\n Till he came to an inn that had light within,\n and tapped at a window-pane.\n A drowsy cook gave a surly look,\n and \u0027What do you want?\u0027 said he.\n \u0027I want fire and gold and songs of old\n and red wine flowing free!\u0027\n \u0027You won\u0027t get them here\u0027, said the cook with a leer,\n \u0027but you may come inside.\n Silver I lack and silk to my back -\n maybe I\u0027ll let you bide\u0027.\n A silver gift the latch to lift,\n a pearl to pass the door;\n For a seat by the cook in the ingle-nook\n it cost him twenty more.\n For hunger or drouth naught passed his mouth\n till he gave both crown and cloak;\n And all that he got, in an earthen pot\n broken and black with smoke,\n Was porridge cold and two days old\n to eat with a wooden spoon.\n For puddings of Yule with plums, poor fool,\n he arrived so much too soon:\n An unwary guest on a lunatic quest\n from the Mountains of the Moon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-7.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: \n The Adventures of Tom Bombadil \n by J.R.R.
