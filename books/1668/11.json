With horns in my mouth I walk in the South, Flapping big ears. Beyond count of years I stump round and round, Never lie on the ground, Not even to die. Oliphaunt am I, Biggest of all, Huge, old, and tall. If ever you\u0027d met me, You wouldn\u0027t forget me. If you never do, You won\u0027t think I\u0027m true; But old Oliphaunt am I. And I never lie.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-11.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
