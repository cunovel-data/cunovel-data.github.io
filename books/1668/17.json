They turned aside:\n \u0027Do you hear the call, Earth-maiden?\n Firiel! Firiel!\u0027 they cried.\n \u0027Our ship is not full-laden.\n One more only we may bear.\n Come! For your days are speeding.\n Come! Earth-maiden elven-fair,\n our last call heeding.\u0027\n Firiel looked from the river-bank,\n one step daring;\n then deep in clay her feet sank,\n and she halted staring.\n Slowly the elven-ship went by\n whispering through the water:\n \u0027I cannot come\u0027 they heard her cry.\n \u0027I was born Earth\u0027s daughter!\u0027\n No jewels bright her gown bore,\n as she walked back from the meadow\n under roof and dark door,\n under the house-shadow.\n She donned her smock of russet brown,\n her long hair braided,\n and to her work came stepping down.\n Soon the sunlight faded.\n Year still after year flows\n down the Seven Rivers;\n cloud passes, sunlight glows,\n reed and willow quivers\n at morn and eve, but never more\n westward ships have waded\n in mortal waters as before,\n and their song has faded. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-17.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: \n The Adventures of Tom Bombadil \n by J.R.R.
