The trees were dark, and the dawn pale, waking birds were cheeping, a wind moved cool and frail through dim leaves creeping. She watched the gleam at window grow, till the long light was shimmering on land and leaf; on grass below grey dew was glimmering. Over the floor her white feet crept, down the stair they twinkled, through the grass they dancing stepped all with dew besprinkled. Her gown had jewels upon its hem, as she ran down to the river, and leaned upon a willow-stem, and watched the water quiver. A kingfisher plunged down like a stone in a blue flash falling, bending reeds were softly blown, lily-leaves were sprawling. A sudden music to her came, as she stood there gleaming with free hair in the morning\u0027s flame on her shoulders streaming. Flutes there were, and harps were wrung, and there was sound of singing, like wind-voices keen and young and far bells ringing. A ship with golden beak and oar and timbers white came gliding; swans went sailing on before, her tall prow guiding. Fair folk out of Elvenland in silver-grey were rowing, and three with crowns she saw there stand with bright hair flowing. With harp in hand they sang their song to the slow oars swinging: \u0027Green is the land, the leaves are long, and the birds are singing. Many a day with dawn of gold this earth will lighten, many a flower will yet unfold, ere the cornfields whiten. \u0027Then whither go ye, boatmen fair, down the river gliding? To twilight and to secret lair in the great forest hiding? To Northern isles and shores of stone on strong swans flying, by cold waves to dwell alone with the white gulls crying?\u0027 \u0027Nay!\u0027 they answered. \u0027Far away on the last road faring, leaving western havens grey, the seas of shadow daring, we go back to Elvenhome, where the White Tree is growing, and the Star shines upon the foam on the last shore flowing. \u0027To mortal fields say farewell, Middle-earth forsaking! In Elvenhome a clear bell in the high tower is shaking. Here grass fades and leaves fall, and sun and moon wither, and we have heard the far call that bids us journey thither\u0027, The oars were stayed. They turned aside: \u0027Do you hear the call, Earth-maiden? Firiel! Firiel!\u0027 they cried. \u0027Our ship is not full-laden. One more only we may bear. Come! For your days are speeding. Come! Earth-maiden elven-fair, our last call heeding.\u0027 Firiel looked from the river-bank, one step daring; then deep in clay her feet sank, and she halted staring. Slowly the elven-ship went by whispering through the water: \u0027I cannot come\u0027 they heard her cry. \u0027I was born Earth\u0027s daughter!\u0027 No jewels bright her gown bore, as she walked back from the meadow under roof and dark door, under the house-shadow. She donned her smock of russet brown, her long hair braided, and to her work came stepping down. Soon the sunlight faded. Year still after year flows down the Seven Rivers; cloud passes, sunlight glows, reed and willow quivers at morn and eve, but never more westward ships have waded in mortal waters as before, and their song has faded.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-adventures-of-tom-bombadil/page-17.html","bookId":1668,"book":{"id":1668,"title":"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil","description":"Storyline: The Adventures of Tom Bombadil by J.R.R.
