{"id":22185,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X DIPLOMACY","content":"It was a most awkward meeting. Dorothy, Train, and Brendon knew the truth, but Mrs. Ward and Vane were ignorant. As to Lord Derrington himself, George was not sure. After his conversation with Lola he had a vague idea that since Bawdsey was connected in some way with his grandfather, Lord Derrington must have somehow learned that Brendon was the name his grandson had taken. There was no other way of accounting for the mention of Derrington\u0027s name by the private inquiry agent. However this might be, Lord Derrington was too clever a man to betray himself. George felt that the old man knew who he was, but he could not be sure, for Derrington welcomed him with a well-bred air, as he would have done a stranger. Mrs. Ward watched the meeting curiously, and Brendon noticed her inquiring gaze. But he put this down to his knowledge that Derrington knew he was a suitor for Dorothy\u0027s hand and wished the girl to marry Vane. Leonard was the only person in the room who displayed any visible disturbance. He grew red and restless. Brendon was perfectly calm. \"How delightful of you to come, Mr. Brendon,\" said Mrs. Ward, rising and apparently forgetting that she had forbidden him the house. \"I must introduce you: Lord Derrington--Mr. Brendon; and you know Mr. Train.\" \"We are old friends,\" said George, calmly. \"Miss Ward\"--he bowed to Dorothy, who emulated his serenity although she felt anxious. But when she saw her lover\u0027s composure she knew that nothing disagreeable would occur, and her apprehensions were relieved. There ensued a general conversation relative to the weather, to the doings of a certain politician, and to sundry other subjects more or less vague. George talked excellently, and was conscious that Derrington was listening with approval. Again and again he wondered if the old man really knew who he was, and again and again he failed to arrive at any conclusion. After a time Leonard went with Dorothy to the piano, where she played for his delectation, and Mrs. Ward seized the opportunity to show Vane some new photographs of herself. Derrington and Brendon were practically alone, and the old lord appeared anxious to make himself agreeable. George was watchful for the cloven hoof, but it did not peep out. Truculent tyrant as Derrington was, yet he could play the part of a highly bred, polished gentleman of the old school to perfection. He did so on this occasion. \"I have heard of you from Mrs. Ward,\" he said in his harsh tones, which no amount of politeness could render agreeable, \"but I do not think we have met before.\" \"No. I cannot recall any meeting,\" replied George, wondering if the other was about to hint that he had seen some one resembling him. \"I have seen you in the distance, however.\" \"Distance lends enchantment to the view in my case.\" \"You are pleased to say so, Lord Derrington.\" \"I generally do say what I please,\" responded the old man, shooting a sharp glance at George. \"Are you related to the Brendons of Shropshire?\" \"No. I have not that privilege.\" Derrington chuckled at this reply. He thought George had a good deal of the man in him when he answered thus fearlessly. \"I have seen your name somewhere lately,\" he observed, \"but I can\u0027t recall where or in what connection.\" Brendon laughed, quite at his ease, although he did not know if this was an attempt to make him speak out. However, he did speak out, with the idea of seeing what would happen. \"I can supply the connection,\" said he, lightly, but keenly observant of the old man\u0027s face. \"My name appeared as a witness at an inquest a week or so back.\" \"Ah, now I remember, Mr. Brendon. Quite so. It was that Amelia Square murder.\" \"You have a good memory, Lord Derrington.\" \"In this case you flatter me, Mr. Brendon. There is no difficulty in my remembering the especial case, as Mrs. Jersey was a tenant of mine.\" George was not supposed to know this and displayed suitable surprise. \"Indeed,\" he said; \"then you have lost a good tenant.\" \"Possibly,\" replied Derrington, rather grimly. \"She always paid her rent regularly. You saw her?\" \"Yes. My friend, Mr. Train, was stopping in the house----\" \"That young man.\" Derrington cast a look in Leonard\u0027s direction. \"I did not know he was there on that night.\" \"He was a witness also,\" said Brendon, significantly. \"I can\u0027t remember all the names sir. Well?\" \"I stopped for the night with Al; Train, and during the night Mrs. Jersey was murdered.\" \"You heard nothing--you saw nothing?\" \"I was sound asleep the whole time,\" said Brendon, calmly. \"Humph!\" Derrington pulled at his gray mustache in the very same way as George did when he was reflective. \"What a pity. You might have discovered the assassin.\" \"I don\u0027t think the assassin will ever be discovered.\" \"That\u0027s luck for the assassin,\" rejoined the old lord, cynically. \"You appear to be very certain, Mr. Brendon.\" George shrugged his shoulders. \"No more certain than the police are,\" he replied. \"They examined every one in the house, and no one could be accused--there was absolutely no evidence. And the assassin could not have entered the house, as the door was locked, and the key was in the pocket of the murdered woman.\" Derrington, for some reason, appeared to be rather relieved. \"I read all that in the papers,\" he said roughly. \"You are telling me nothing new. But there, you didn\u0027t say you would. By the way, you stopped at that house. Do you know a Miss Bull?\" George nodded. \"She told my fortune,\" he said. \"She told Mrs. Jersey\u0027s fortune also, and a very true fortune did she tell,\" said Derrington, grimly. \"What did she prophesy about you?\" \"The usual thing,\" said Brendon, curtly. \"Trouble, I suppose. These card-people generally prophesy trouble, as it is certain to occur.\" \"There was trouble and enemies, and the promise that I should get my wish,\" said Brendon, with a quick look. Derrington laughed. \"What is your wish?\" \"If I tell it I won\u0027t get it,\" replied George, also laughing; \"but I don\u0027t believe in fortune-telling. It is rubbish.\" \"It wasn\u0027t in Mrs. Jersey\u0027s case,\" said the other, who appeared to be a trifle superstitious. \"Oh, that was a mere coincidence. But you asked me about Miss Bull, sir! Do you know her?\" Derrington nodded. \"She came to me on behalf of Mrs. Jersey\u0027s niece and wished the lease renewed. I heard her story and consented. I dare say the niece will be quite as good a tenant as the aunt.\" This conversation was all very well, but there was nothing to be learned from it on either side. Brendon could not discover if his grandfather knew to whom he was speaking, and Derrington found it impossible to learn if George could tell him anything of the case which had not been reported in the papers. For some reason Derrington wished to know what had transpired, and Brendon felt convinced that this anxiety was more than that of a landlord for the loss of a good tenant. He wondered if Derrington knew that Mrs. Jersey had written out a confession and that it was missing. He would had liked to find out, but since he could not reveal himself as Derrington\u0027s grandson there was no chance of getting this information. Besides, Derrington appeared to grow weary of discussing the murder. \"It is worn threadbare,\" he said. \"All the papers have been talking about it. I agree with you, Mr. Brendon, that the assassin will never be discovered.\" \"Never!\" said George, looking full at the determined face of the old man. \"Are you quite sure? \"I am sure of nothing in this world, save that you said so yourself, Mr. Brendon. However, there are pleasanter subjects to talk of. What about yourself--your aims, your ambitions, your chances of success?\" \"Are those pleasant subjects?\" laughed Brendon. \"To an old man such as I am,\" nodded the other. \"I like to hear of the castles in the air which youth builds.\" \"I am afraid my castles will never turn to bricks and mortar,\" said Brendon with a sigh. However, he was not averse to showing his grandfather that he was no fool, but a man with a head on his shoulders. George had a quick brain and a strong will and a considerable fund of information. He had taken a good degree at Oxford, and his literary articles always received praise from the public, and from his brethren of the press. Moreover, George was fond of politics, and could converse excellently on that fascinating subject. He laid himself out to please Derrington, knowing that the old tyrant was disappointed in the languid Vane, who was chattering commonplace to Mrs. Ward. In a short time Brendon and Derrington were engaged in a discussion about Ireland and Irish Home Rule, and the old lord approved, highly of Brendon\u0027s sentiments. \"You ought to be in the House, Mr. Brendon,\" he said. \"I have no one to help me to such a goal.\" Derrington was about to speak, and fastened his little eyes on the keen, handsome face of the younger man. But he suddenly changed his mind and turned away to talk to Mrs. Ward. Brendon knew that he had succeeded in pleasing the old gentleman, and was glad that so much was accomplished. If Derrington found that he was clever and presentable, and likely to add luster to the family name, it was not improbable that he would recognize the marriage. But by this time George had it in his mind that Derrington knew who he was, and had been talking advisedly under the cover of pretended ignorance, so as to see what manner of man his unacknowledged grandson was. \"Well,\" thought Brendon, \"he has learned that I am no fool, at all events.\" Mrs. Ward came across to George and left Derrington talking to Dorothy, for whom he professed a great admiration. He knew that Dorothy liked Brendon, as Mrs. Ward had told him so, and he frankly acknowledged to her that Brendon was a clever man. \"I wish my grandson had his brains,\" said Derrington, regretfully. \"I am pleased you like him,\" responded Dorothy, who could not tell him that Brendon was his grandson, and hardly knew what to say. \"He is as good as he is clever.\" This remark did not please Derrington. \"Humph! I don\u0027t like good young men. They generally become bad old scamps.\" \"Were you a good young man, Lord Derrington?\" asked Dorothy, demurely. He appreciated the joke. \"One of the best,\" he said, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"consequently I have gone to the other extreme for many years.\" \"They say one always returns to his first loves,\" said Dorothy, smiling, \"so you may revert to your godly youth.\" Derrington shook his wicked old head. \"My first loves are all dead and buried, my dear. But this Brendon--you like him?\" Dorothy did not see why see should conceal her feelings. \"I love him,\" she said quietly and firmly. \"Ha!\" replied Derrington, showing no surprise. \"Mrs. Ward hinted at something of that sort, but I thought that Walter----\" \"Please say no more, Lord Derrington.\" \"Well, then, I won\u0027t.\" Derrington\u0027s eyes rested wrathfully on the withered young man he called grandson. \"I don\u0027t wonder at your choice, my dear. What Walter requires is a nurse.\" \"That is a profession I have not taken up,\" said Dorothy, laughing. She was very anxious to say something good about George to Derrington, on the chance that it might soften his hard old heart. But after all, George had spoken for himself and was his own best advocate. If she interfered, seeing that she was supposed to know nothing of the relationship, she might make mischief. Therefore she held her tongue on the subject nearest to her heart and talked in the most general manner. Derrington said no more about Brendon, but Dorothy noticed that his eyes were rarely off the face of her lover. George had certainly made an impression. Meantime, Vane joined Mrs. Ward, and Dorothy, seeing that Leonard was alone, beckoned him to approach. Derrington was not particularly pleased at having his conversation with a pretty girl interrupted, but he was polite, and, on learning that Train knew Brendon intimately, he began to ask him about his friend. Train, to please Dorothy, and because he really admired George, spoke most enthusiastically. Dorothy listened in silence, well pleased. From Derrington\u0027s curiosity and persistent questioning she began to think he knew something of the relationship. \"But really, you know, she is a great artist,\" Mrs. Ward was saying to Brendon; \"there is something so original about her.\" They were speaking of Lola Velez, and it was Vane who had introduced the subject. As Mrs. Ward was a married woman, and knew the seamy side of social life, Vane had no hesitation in speaking about the dancer to her. George, to whom the subject was distasteful, tried to avoid the discussion; but Mrs. Ward, on the alert for information, would return again and again to the topic. \"They say you know her very well,\" she declared. \"They? Who?\" asked Brendon, lifting his eyebrows. \"I do, for one,\" said Vane in his weak voice; \"a fellow told me that she owed her success to you.\" \"I am not sorry to put you right on that point,\" replied Brendon, his eyes hardening; \"many false rumors are about--to one of which you alluded the other day, Mrs. Ward. This is another. What I know of Senora Velez, and how I know her, can be put in a nutshell,\" and George quietly related his rescue of the dancer. \"Then you did make her the success she is!\" cried Mrs. Ward, when he ended. \"Oh, yes, it\u0027s no use denying it. You picked a jewel out of the gutter and gave it a chance of shining.\" \"Perhaps I did that much. But she made a success by her genius.\" \"I hope she is grateful,\" murmured Vane, with a malicious smile. Brendon turned on him sharply. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean by gratitude,\" he said deliberately. \"Well,\" drawled the little dandy, \"she is pretty and----\" \"She is not at all pretty, Mr. Vane, and were she as lovely as Cleopatra it would not matter to me. My connection with her ceased when she made her success.\" George quite forgot the presence of Mrs. Ward and spoke vehemently. \"Can\u0027t you understand that a man may do a kind action without being biased by the beauty of a woman?\" \"Some men can,\" said Mrs. Ward, politely, \"and I am sure you are one, Mr. Brendon. But suppose the woman----\" \"I don\u0027t suppose anything, Mrs. Ward. I know. Senora Velez was poor. I helped her to attain to the position she now holds because I endeavor to follow the preaching of Christ, and she is to me a grateful friend. There is no more and no less to be said,\" and, a trifle ruffled, George turned on his heel to join Dorothy. \"Well, I\u0027m sure,\" murmured Mrs. Ward, \"and in my own house, too.\" Vane sniggered. \"There must be something in it,\" he said. \"And the profane language he used. Of course I don\u0027t believe a word he says.\" \"Neither do I. She\u0027s too pretty.\" So these two scandal-mongers talked on, and George had only made matters worse by his explanation. However, he believed that he had nipped the scandal in the bud, and strolled into the next room with Dorothy to quiet his mind. Behind them they left Derrington talking to Train and rather enjoying himself. The room in which they found themselves was a pretty little apartment hung with amber silk, and illuminated with lights in yellow shades. The furniture was also yellow, and the carpet of a primrose hue. Mrs. Ward only introduced her most intimate friends into this boudoir, as it was her own special sanctum; and if its walls could have spoken they could have supplied all the existing society papers with gossip enough to last a century. \"Do you think Lord Derrington knows who you are?\" asked Dorothy as they seated themselves on a kind of divan. \"I am not sure,\" replied George, who did not want to tell her what he knew, lest he should have to introduce the name of Lola Velez. \"I have an idea that he does.\" Dorothy shook her head. \"I don\u0027t think so. If he knows you he must be aware that you know him, and about the relationship, and would not speak so freely. I think he is taken with you, George.\" \"Well, he has been putting me through my paces. I only hope that our chance meeting of to-night may bear fruit. What is Train doing here? Your mother only had him in her house once before, and she does not like him.\" \"I can\u0027t make out why she asked him,\" said Dorothy; \"he is a dull young man, though harmless enough. But my mother made a point of asking him to dinner.\" \"Humph! I wonder what that\u0027s for,\" said Brendon, wrinkling his brows, for he knew well that Mrs. Ward did nothing without expecting an equivalent return. Then he recollected her questions about the crime, and wondered if she had invited Leonard so as to pump him. It was just what Mrs. Ward did intend to do, but George could not think she had sufficient interest in the crime to justify such a course of action. Besides, he felt that he could trust Leonard to hold his tongue, in spite of the man\u0027s weakness. But in this he reckoned without Mrs. Ward, who could have wiled an anchorite to chatter, had she been so minded. And that is what she was doing at the very moment. Almost as soon as the lovers had disappeared into the yellow boudoir Lord Derrington had taken his departure. He insisted that Vane should come also, and would not allow the little dandy to take leave of Dorothy, nor would he take leave himself. This was done to punish Vane. \"Miss Ward is quite happy in there,\" he said to Mrs. Ward at the door of the drawing-room. \"I won\u0027t have her disturbed.\" \"Oh, but really,\" cried Mrs. Ward, who did not want Vane to go away with a bad impression, \"Dorothy is simply bored with him.\" \"If she is bored with such a brilliant fellow she would not enjoy the company of Shakespeare himself.\" \"I\u0027m sure I shouldn\u0027t,\" murmured Mrs. Ward. \"Shakespeare must have been an awful bore. But do say good-by, Lord Derrington. Dorothy will be so disappointed.\" \"No, she won\u0027t,\" snarled Derrington, who was enjoying himself at thus thwarting Mrs. Ward\u0027s schemes. \"Come along, Walter. Take me home and tell me your latest ailment. Good-night, Mrs. Ward,\" and he went. Derrington was chuckling, and Vane looked very sulky, so Mrs. Ward saw that the old man had done this thing to spite her. \"Horrid creature!\" she pouted; \"he ought to be dead and buried. It isn\u0027t respectable being alive at his time of life. He\u0027ll make Walter Vane angry with me, and I\u0027m sure----\" Here she caught, sight of Leonard\u0027s astonished face, and became aware she was divulging secrets. At once she smoothed her brow and began to smile. This was an excellent opportunity to find out what she wanted. Taking Leonard\u0027s arm she led him to a chair some distance from the door of the boudoir. \"Now let us have a nice long talk, dear Mr. Train,\" she said, settling herself amiably. \"Mr. Brendon and Dorothy are no doubt talking tadpoles or frogs or something nasty. They won\u0027t be out for a long time, so we can renew our pleasant conversation.\" \"I don\u0027t think it was very pleasant,\" said Train, unwillingly. \"What an ungallant thing to say!\" \"I mean to talk about crime----\" \"Is most amusing--I mean instructive. Oh, yes, I have read many of those novels--what do they call them?--detective novels.\" \"A very low form of literature,\" said the superior Leonard. \"Oh, they are amusing and interesting, and send one to sleep when one can\u0027t in spite of drops and morphia!\" babbled Mrs. Ward in her childish manner. \"And I have often thought how nice it would be if one could really try and find out who killed a person. Now in this case, Mr. Train, I am sure you heard something or saw something----\" \"Upon my word I neither saw nor heard,\" protested Leonard. \"I was in bed all the time.\" \"Didn\u0027t you hear a scream?\" \"No.\" \"Then you must have heard the fall of the body, or the shutting of the door as the--ah!\" Mrs. Ward saw from the expression of Leonard\u0027s face that she had touched upon something. \"You did hear----\" \"No! no!\" he stammered, wondering how he was to get out of confessing about the opening of the front door without appearing rude. \"Nonsense. Confess! Confess, you silly man!\" But Leonard was too loyal. To lead her away from the point he asked a question. \"Mrs. Ward, that yellow holly?\" \"Yes. What about it?\" She leaned forward eagerly. \"Did you give a sprig of it to any one else?\" \"No. I only gave a bit to my daughter, and she----\" \"She gave it to Brendon. Yes, I know. But did Miss Ward give any of it to a third person?\" \"Certainly not. To do so she would have had to get it from me. But beyond the sprig that was given, and which Mr. Brendon had, no holly went out of this house.\" \"It is very rare, is it not?\" \"I believe so. I dare say there wasn\u0027t another bunch in London on that particular night. Of course there might have been, still--but why do you ask all this?\" \"Well,\" said Leonard, \"it seems to me that the yellow holly has something to do with the crime.\" Mrs. Ward drew a long breath but said no word. He was speaking half to himself, and she did not wish to interrupt his train of thought. But she listened with all her ears. Leonard continued: \"I found a berry in the room where she was killed. Yes. They took us in to see the body, and a horrid sight it was. I turned my eyes to the floor, and there I saw--just by the table--a kind of amber bead. I dropped my handkerchief so that Quex might not suspect, and I picked it up. When in my own room I examined it. It was one of the yellow holly berries.\" Mrs. Ward threw herself back with a kind of unholy triumph. \"Do you know what you are saying, Mr. Train?\" she said in a half whisper. \"You are accusing Mr. Brendon----\" \"No! no!\" Train started to his feet. Mrs. Ward pulled him down again and pointed with her fan toward the boudoir. \"Hush! He might come out,\" she whispered. \"But can\u0027t you see? Brendon wore the sprig in his coat on that night. He must have been in the room and have dropped the berry. What was he doing there if it was not to----\" \"No,\" said Train, hoarsely. \"I half thought of that myself, but it is quite impossible, I tell you. He could not have got out of his room unless he had come to me.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"I locked the door of the sitting-room, which was between his bedroom and mine. There was no exit from his bedroom, and to get out and down the stairs he would have had to open the sitting-room door. Now the key was under my pillow and the door was locked in the morning. No, Mrs. Ward, Brendon is innocent.\" \"He might have stolen the key while you slept.\" Train shook his head. \"Impossible. I sleep very lightly, and on that night I hardly slept at all.\" \"Why. Was anything wrong?\" \"I can\u0027t tell you that, Mrs. Ward, without violating the confidence of my friend. Indeed, I have said too much. Promise me you will not speak of what I have told you.\" \"I promise, but I am quite sure that the holly berry was dropped by George Brendon, and that he was in Mrs. Jersey\u0027s sitting-room on that night. He is the criminal.\" \"I tell you he is not, Mrs. Ward.\" \"Don\u0027t excite yourself, Mr. Train. Here is Mr. Brendon and Dorothy.\" She sailed toward them with open hands. \"Finished your talk. We must say good-night.\" And to herself she murmured, while smiling, \"I\u0027ve got you at last--I\u0027ve got you at last.\" And Brendon shook hands with Madame Judas, quite unconscious of her premeditated treachery.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1826/52993.html","bookId":1021,"book":{"id":1021,"title":"The Yellow Holly","description":"简介： She did not put the sacramental phrase on her cards, as no invitations were sent out.
