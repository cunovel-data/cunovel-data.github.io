{"id":22189,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV MRS. WARD\u0027S TRUMP CARD","content":"Kowlaski was a large, fat, good-natured blackguard of a man, quite without principle. He came from some remote village in the Balkans and was of Jewish birth. In his early days he arrived in London penniless and strove to make a living by selling toys in the street. Then he turned scene-shifter at a music-hall, and while thus engaged educated himself to write and read and to speak English with wonderful fluency. Also he saved money and speculated in a small way, having the marvelous Hebrew instinct of picking out lucrative ventures. Shortly he became stage manager. Then he found a clever woman who sang badly and acted wonderfully. Kowlaski advertised her into a success and she proved grateful. There is no need to trace his steady rise; but one thing led to another until he became proprietor of the very music-hall which had witnessed his humble beginning. \n \n When he first set eyes on Lola he had guessed that it would pay to invest money in her. The success of the ballet proved that Kowlaski was right as usual, and he smiled his oily smile when he saw the crowded houses and looked over the receipts. The ballet would run for more than a year. He was sure of that, and set about some other business now that the music-hall was flourishing. It was at this point that Lola demanded a week\u0027s holiday. Kowlaski whimpered. He usually did so to make people think he was weak. But under his apparent weakness he was possessed of an iron strength. \n \n Having great experience of women he thought to control Lola, but she, being gifted with a superlative temper, laughed in his face. All his cleverness could not make her swerve from the point. \"I want a week to myself,\" she said doggedly. They were talking in French, as Kowlaski could swear more easily in that tongue and wanted freedom of speech. \n \n \"But, my dear child--\" Kowlaski was always paternal--\"it will not do. You are the draw, and if you go out of the bill the people will not come to my house.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t care. I want a week, and a week I will have.\" \n \n \"Why do you wish for this week?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s my business.\" \n \n Kowlaski tried temper. \"If you go, you leave my theater once and for all the time.\" \n \n \"Pschutt!\" said Lola, snapping her fingers in his dismayed face. \"I draw, and you are in no hurry to get rid of me.\" \n \n Kowlaski tried reproaches. \"If you were a grateful woman----\" \n \n \"Ah, bah! What of gratitude? You wanted me or would you have seen me die in the gutter.\" \n \n Kowlaski began to whimper. \"You will ruin me, my dear!\" \n \n \"It would serve you right if I did. You have ruined others in your time. Don\u0027t you think I know you? Come--\" she rapped on the table--\"I want the week. To-morrow and till next Wednesday I\u0027m out of the bill.\" \n \n \"But it cannot be done.\" \n \n \"It must be. I want it to be done.\" \n \n Kowlaski tried bribing. \"I will raise your salary if you stay!\" \n \n \"Oh, la, la, la, la! I am quite pleased with what I get. If I wished my salary raised I should have it raised. I go for a week.\" \n \n In the face of this obstinacy Kowlaski gave in. But first of all he tried threats, and Lola threatened to throw a chair at him. He finally agreed that she should have her week, and Lola walked out of the office without thanking him. That was the last he saw of her for seven days. \n \n He made the most of her absence, declaring that she had been called away to nurse a dying mother and would reappear with a broken heart to keep her engagements with the public. Bawdsey saw this notice. \n \n It was the first he had heard of Lola\u0027s escapade, and he went at once to her rooms in Bloomsbury to ask where she was going. Lola had already gone, and, according to the landlady, had left no information as to her whereabouts. \n \n \"Did she take a box?\" asked Bawdsey. \n \n \"A small box. She went away in a cab.\" \n \n \"Where did she tell the cabman to drive to?\" \n \n \"To Oxford Street.\" \n \n Bawdsey was disappointed. He saw that Lola had taken every precaution to hide her trail, and that there was not much chance of finding her. However, he went to see Kowlaski. The manager began to talk of the dying mother, and Bawdsey shut him up. \n \n \"Rubbish! That\u0027s for the public. I want to know where she is. \n \n \"My dear, I do not know,\" said Kowlaski, and for the first time in his wicked old life he told the truth. \n \n Not to be beaten, Bawdsey sought out George Brendon. But George was as ignorant as the manager and the landlady. \"I haven\u0027t the slightest idea,\" he said, when Bawdsey asked; \"and, to tell you the truth, I don\u0027t see why you should try to find out.\" \n \n \"I want to know.\" \n \n \"That is apparent on the face of it. But you are not engaged to marry her, are you, Mr. Bawdsey?\" \n \n \"No such luck,\" replied the detective, with a dismal face. \n \n \"Then I don\u0027t see what right you have to control her movements.\" \n \n \"Did she write and tell you where she was going?\" \n \n \"No, and if she had done so I should not tell you,\" replied George, annoyed by the man\u0027s persistence. \n \n \"You may as well be civil to me, Mr. Brendon; you know that I am your friend.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027ve heard all that before! But people who talk much of friendship and gratitude are generally humbugs.\" \n \n \"I am not,\" said Bawdsey, quietly. \"See here, Mr. Brendon, Lola is in love with you----\" \n \n \"That\u0027s my business. Leave it alone.\" \n \n Bawdsey took up his hat. \"Oh, very well! If you will not be civil I cannot help you to learn who killed your father.\" \n \n \"What!\" George sprang from the table at which he was writing and seized the man\u0027s arm. \"Do you know that?\" \n \n \"Gently, Mr. Brendon. No, I do not know, but----\" \n \n \"Then what do you mean by saying----\" \n \n \"We had better have a chat,\" said Bawdsey, and sat down. \"But I wish to know where I stand. Lola loves you. Do you love her?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Brendon, seeing that he would have to humor the man. \"I am engaged to marry Miss Ward.\" \n \n \"Will you help me to marry Lola?\" \n \n \"Willingly--though, to tell you the truth, I know very little about you, and to make that girl marry you----\" \n \n \"Oh, Lola can look after herself, Mr. Brendon. If she becomes my wife she will have the upper hand. But I am so deeply in love with her that I am willing to play second fiddle. Can\u0027t you dispossess her of this infatuation for you?\" \n \n George shook his head and groaned. \"No. She won\u0027t listen to reason.\" \n \n \"Well,\" drawled Bawdsey, recurring to his American accent, \"I don\u0027t blame her for that. She is in love, and love listens to no one and nothing. I wouldn\u0027t listen to reason, either, if it entailed giving up Lola.\" \n \n \"See here, Bawdsey, if you can persuade this woman to get over her liking for me, and to marry you, I shall be delighted. I do not know where she is just now, but it is my impression that she has gone away because she is afraid of me.\" \n \n \"Afraid of you? Oh, that\u0027s absurd!\" \n \n \"No, it isn\u0027t. The other morning she saw Miss Ward, and there was a scene in the Park.\" \n \n Bawdsey hung his red head. \"I fear that is my fault,\" he confessed. \"I pointed out Miss Ward to Lola, and----\" \n \n \"And it was I who foolishly mentioned that Miss Ward sometimes took a walk in the morning--in the Park.\" \n \n \"Oh,\" said Bawdsey, \"I mentioned that also.\" \n \n \"Did you wish Lola to see Miss Ward?\" asked George, angrily. \n \n \"No. Nor did I intend to say anything about the walking in the early morning. I simply pointed her out in the box to Lola, so that Lola might see there was no chance of your marrying her.\" \n \n \"As if any woman would accept such an excuse,\" said Brendon, contemptuously. \"Then she questioned you about the walk?\" \n \n \"Yes. She mentioned something about what you had told her, and I was rather free with my tongue. I am not usually,\" said Bawdsey, penitently, \"but there\u0027s something about Lola that makes me behave like a child. I\u0027m wax in her hands. So she saw Miss Ward?\" \n \n \"Yes. And she knows that I am angry. Of course Miss Ward sent to tell me at once, and I called on Lola to give her a talking to, but she was gone when I arrived.\" \n \n \"Would you have spoken harshly to her?\" \n \n \"Certainly. She had no right to trouble Miss Ward. But now you know why I think she has left town. In a week she will come back thinking my anger is at an end.\" \n \n \"And will it be?\" asked Bawdsey, doubtfully. \n \n \"It is at an end now. I am quite content not to see Lola again so long as she leaves Miss Ward alone.\" \n \n \"I will try and keep her away,\" said the detective, \"but I have very little influence with her.\" \n \n \"Tell her I am angry and will be still more angry if she does not keep away from Curzon Street. Well, we have discussed this matter. I now want to hear what you meant by your reference to my father. Do you know who killed him?\" \n \n Bawdsey shook his head. \"I can\u0027t say for certain, but I can tell you who might know.\" \n \n \"Who is that?\" \n \n \"Mr. Roger Ireland.\" \n \n George looked astonished. \"But that is ridiculous,\" he said. \"Mr. Ireland told me that he did not know.\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t say that he knows for certain. But he is better acquainted with the matter than you think.\" \n \n \"How did you come to know Mr. Ireland?\" \n \n \"He called to see Miss Bull, and I dropped across him.\" \n \n \"How did you get talking of the case?\" \n \n \"Well, you see,\" said Bawdsey, easily, \"we naturally talked of Mrs. Jersey, and one thing led to another until I discovered that Ireland had been in San Remo when your father was murdered. I wished to find out who killed him, so I questioned Mr. Ireland.\" \n \n \"Why do you wish to know who killed my father?\" asked George. \n \n \"Because I think that the murder of Mrs. Jersey is connected with that crime. See here--\" Bawdsey cleared his throat--\"Mrs. Jersey was in San Remo at the time of the death----\" \n \n \"How do you know that?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t I tell you I questioned Mr. Ireland?\" \n \n George looked sharply at the detective. \"What magic did you use to make him talk? Mr. Ireland knows how to hold his tongue.\" \n \n \"Well, when he found that I was looking after the case of Mrs. Jersey (and I made no secret of that) he was good enough to tell me all he knew. He thought, as I did, that the murder in San Remo was connected with the crime of Amelia Square.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" George wasn\u0027t at all satisfied, as he could not conceive how Bawdsey had induced Ireland to talk. However, he thought it wise to say no more, as he did not wish to make Bawdsey angry and thus run a chance of losing his explanation. \"Go on.\" \n \n \"There is nothing more to say,\" said Bawdsey, rising. \"Mr. Ireland declined to tell me who he thought was guilty, but he hinted that he had seen the lady in the blue domino unmasked.\" \n \n \"Did he recognize her?\" \n \n \"I think he did, but he assured me that he could not be sure, and that he had not seen the lady again.\" \n \n \"Then he did know the face?\" \n \n Bawdsey\u0027s face assumed an impenetrable expression. \"I can only refer you to Mr. Ireland,\" he said; \"and as to Lola----\" \n \n \"Oh, she\u0027ll turn up again,\" said Brendon, irritably. \"Don\u0027t worry me about Lola. I wish you would marry her and take her back to your native land.\" \n \n \"What land am I native of, Mr. Brendon?\" asked Bawdsey, calmly. \n \n \"America, I understand. You hinted as much when we met.\" \n \n Bawdsey shook his head. \"I am as English as you are,\" he declared. \n \n \"Well,\" said Brendon, with a shrug, \"I thought as much. Your accent fails at times. You are not a good actor, Bawdsey.\" \n \n \"I may be a better actor than you think, Mr. Brendon.\" \n \n \"What do you mean by that?\" \n \n \"Never you mind, sir. I can hold my tongue when it suits me, and on this occasion it does suit me. But remember, Mr. Brendon, that whatever happens you have a friend in me.\" \n \n \"What is going to happen?\" \n \n Bawdsey shook his head solemnly. \"One never knows. We are not out of the wood yet, Mr. Brendon.\" \n \n \"Are you referring to my father\u0027s murder?\" \n \n \"And to Mrs. Jersey\u0027s. I have my suspicions, and--well, there\u0027s nothing more to be said. When I am certain I shall let you know.\" \n \n \"You have your suspicions, then?\" \n \n \"Yes. But I shall not impart them to any one--not even to you.\" \n \n \"One moment, Bawdsey,\" said Brendon, as the man had his hand on the door. \"Do you suspect Miss Bull?\" \n \n \"Why should I suspect her?\" asked the detective, in surprise. \n \n \"Because she was not on good terms with Mrs. Jersey, and you have taken up your abode in the house----\" \n \n \"To watch her, you would say. Well, maybe,\" rejoined the man, composedly. \"I know what I know, and when I am more certain of what I know, sir----\" He nodded. \"Good-day,\" he said, and went abruptly. \n \n It struck George that Bawdsey was a most mysterious person and knew far more about the San Remo murder than Derrington could have told him. Still, it was possible that Derrington had unbosomed himself to Bawdsey, and it was necessary to do so if he wanted the murder of Mrs. Jersey cleared up. And Derrington, from his refusal to admit that he was at the house on the night and about the time the crime was committed, seemed to knew something that might lead to the detection of the assassin. \n \n \"Humph,\" said George to himself when alone, \"I have a great mind to go round and see that old man. It seems to me that Bawdsey is trying to serve two masters. It is impossible that my grandfather can know the truth. Yet, going by his height and figure, and that sable claret-colored coat, he was certainly in the house on the night in question. But it\u0027s none of my business.\" \n \n He sat down again to his work and tried to interest himself in the chapter he was writing. But it was all in vain. Bawdsey\u0027s speech and Bawdsey\u0027s manner, and a conviction that the man was playing his grandfather false, kept recurring to his mind. After an hour\u0027s futile work he threw down the pen in despair and went out to call on Derrington. \n \n On arriving at St. Giles Square he saw a carriage at the door of the mansion. On asking for Lord Derrington, George was informed that his lordship was engaged with Mrs. Ward and could see no one. Brendon turned away, wondering that he had not recognized the carriage, and he was still more vexed with himself when Dorothy put her head out of the brougham and called to him. \n \n \"My dearest,\" he said softly, so that the coachman and footman might not hear, \"this is an unexpected pleasure. Why are you not inside?\" \n \n \"My mother wished to see Lord Derrington alone,\" replied Dorothy. \"I am waiting till she comes out. She has been with him for half an hour. I don\u0027t know what they are talking about.\" \n \n It was at this moment that a message was brought out of the house from Mrs. Ward saying that her daughter could drive home as she would not be disengaged for another hour. Dorothy looked puzzled. \"I can\u0027t understand,\" she said; \"there is something wrong with my mother. Lord Derrington came to see her one day and she has been upset ever since.\" \n \n George shook his head. He suspected Mrs. Ward of knowing more than she chose to confess, and based his suspicions on the fact of the yellow holly which she had given to Dorothy to present to him. She had made her daughter a cat\u0027s-paw, but why she should wish to startle Mrs. Jersey with a reminder of the San Remo murder was a thing George could not understand. Meanwhile, he kept these suspicions to himself and made some excuse. \"Oh, Mrs. Ward and my grandfather are probably talking over my iniquities,\" he said easily. \"But I don\u0027t see why I should not take advantage of this chance.\" \n \n \"What do you mean, George?\" asked Dorothy with a becoming blush. \n \n \"Well, here is the brougham, and here you are. Why shouldn\u0027t we drive around the Park before you go home?\" \n \n \"My mother will be angry,\" said Dorothy, hesitating. Then she blushed again. \"But I shall brave her anger. We have much to talk about, as I wish to speak of Lola Velez.\" \n \n \"Dorothy, you surely do not think----\" \n \n \"No, no! But I want to ask you a few questions. I believe she is mad, George. Get in and we will drive round the Park.\" \n \n The order was given, George seated himself beside his divinity, and they drove away for a pleasant hour. \"You see Fate plays into our hands,\" said George, taking those of Dorothy in his own. And then the conversation became quite private and very, very confidential. \n \n Meantime, Mrs. Ward was seated in a chair facing Lord Derrington. The old gentleman looked savage, but Mrs. Ward was quite at her ease. They had been having a war of words, and Mrs. Ward so far had come off best. The conversation had been in reference to the sentence whispered in the little woman\u0027s ear when he had made her promise to hold her tongue about George. \n \n \"Of course I do think it is the meanest thing a man can do,\" said Mrs. Ward, bitterly. \"What if I did cheat at cards? Every woman does that, and I was losing no end of money.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think your friends would take that view,\" said Derrington, grimly. \"I came to hear of the matter quite by chance, and it is plain that you won over a hundred pounds by cheating.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s that horrid Mrs. Wayflete who told you----\" \n \n \"No. If Mrs. Wayflete knows, she has held her tongue. I learned it from a source of which you are ignorant. But the fact remains, you cheated, and if your friends knew it you would be ostracized by all of them.\" \n \n \"As if they did not do these things themselves,\" retorted Mrs. Ward; \"but since you have been so nasty, I intend to be nasty, too.\" \n \n \"I shouldn\u0027t advise you to be nasty to me, Mrs. Ward. I have a large reserve fund of strength.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll need it all to hold your own against me.\" Lord Derrington nodded. \"I quite admit that you are a dangerous woman,\" he said quietly. \n \n \"Well, and in what way have you made up your mind to be nasty?\" \n \n Mrs. Ward laughed. \"You needn\u0027t repeat my adjectives,\" she said in her most frivolous manner. \"If you want to know the way in which I intend to protect myself----\" \n \n \"What do you mean by that?\" \n \n \"I mean this,\" cried the little woman, growing angry all at once. \"I am not going to be threatened about that unfortunate episode connected with the cards--it was that horrid Mrs. Wayflete who told you, so don\u0027t deny it--I am not going to be threatened without holding my own. Besides, I want Dorothy to marry your grandson.\" \n \n \"Which one?\" asked Derrington, coolly. \n \n \"You have only Walter Vane.\" \n \n \"Excuse me, George Brendon, whether there is a marriage or not, is equally my grandson.\" \n \n \"I believe you admire him.\" \n \n \"Very much, and it is in my mind to acknowledge him as my heir.\" \n \n \"I thought as much after your sticking up for him the other day,\" said Mrs. Ward, furiously. \"Now, look here, Lord Derrington. If Dorothy marries that Brendon creature I won\u0027t be able to do a thing with her--you know quite well I won\u0027t.\" \n \n \"That means you won\u0027t be able to handle my money through George after I am dead,\" said Derrington, grimly. \n \n \"You can put it that way if you like. But Walter shall be Dorothy\u0027s husband, I have made up my mind.\" \n \n \"Because he\u0027s a fool and putty in your hands.\" \n \n \"I shouldn\u0027t be vulgar if I were you,\" said Mrs. Ward, in a dignified manner, and quite forgetting that she had once used the same illustration herself in connection with Brendon. \"But so long as George leaves Dorothy alone I shall say nothing.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s really very good of you, Mrs. Ward.\" \n \n \"Your being nasty won\u0027t make me change my mind. But you quite understand the situation, Lord Derrington. Walter is to marry my daughter, and George is to be kept away.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see how he is to be kept away. I assure you Brendon is a strong man, and his will is quite equal to mine.\" \n \n \"Nonsense, you have the strongest will in London.\" \n \n \"And you come here to try and break it.\" \n \n \"Life is a game,\" said Mrs. Ward, leaning back, with a pretty air of philosophy. \"And at present I hold the trump card.\" \n \n \"What is it?\" asked Derrington, wondering by what means she hoped to make him consent to her demands. \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you presently,\" said Mrs. Ward, in a most masterful tone, which amused Derrington. \"But you understand that if George Brendon doesn\u0027t keep away I shall give information to the police and have him arrested in connection with that murder.\" \n \n \"Oh, no, you won\u0027t,\" said Derrington, good-humoredly. \n \n \"Oh, yes, I shall. As to your accusation about my having cheated, you shall say nothing about that.\" \n \n \"Indeed, I shall do so if you trouble Brendon.\" \n \n \"Think of Dorothy.\" \n \n \"I do think of Dorothy, and I\u0027m very sorry she has such a mother.\" \n \n \"You dare to insult me,\" began Mrs. Ward, when Derrington, who was losing patience, cut her short. \n \n \"I\u0027ve had enough of this,\" he said sharply. \"You shall hold your tongue about Brendon or I\u0027ll tell what I know.\" \n \n \"Then I\u0027ll do the same.\" \n \n Derrington bowed politely. \"By all means,\" he said. \"My reputation is already so bad that a word or two from you can scarcely make it worse.\" \n \n \"Oh, it\u0027s more than that,\" said Mrs. Ward, quietly, and she spoke in so positive a manner that Derrington began to recollect his worst sins. \"Do you remember the night you came home here at one o\u0027clock and found me in this very room?\" \n \n \"Yes. You came with the amiable intention of telling me that George Brendon was going to pass the night at Mrs. Jersey\u0027s, and that you suspected that he was up to mischief.\" \n \n \"I took the trouble to come from a party for that very purpose,\" was Mrs. Ward\u0027s plaintive reply, \"and how was I received?\" \n \n \"I told you to mind your own business, if I remember.\" \n \n \"And you swore at me,\" said the little woman; \"as if a man who calls himself a gentleman----\" \n \n \"Mrs. Ward, I am getting tired of this circumlocution. What is it you have to say?\" \n \n \"Well, on that night you were in a fir coat.\" \n \n \"My usual coat in winter.\" \n \n \"It was the night when Mrs. Jersey was killed.\" \n \n \"Was it, indeed? I never noticed the coincidence.\" \n \n \"No. But you knew about it,\" said Mrs. Ward; \"you threw your coat on yonder sofa. I seated myself near it by chance. There was something hard in the pocket of the coat. When you were out of the room I took the something out. There it is,\" and she laid an Italian stiletto on the table. \n \n \"What is that?\" asked Derrington, calmly, but with an anxious face. \n \n \"That,\" said Mrs. Ward, touching it daintily with her finger, \"is the weapon with which Mrs. Jersey was stabbed.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1826/52997.html","bookId":1021,"book":{"id":1021,"title":"The Yellow Holly","description":"简介： She did not put the sacramental phrase on her cards, as no invitations were sent out.
