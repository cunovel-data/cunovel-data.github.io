{"id":22198,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII THE TURNING OF THE LANE","content":"The proverb says that \"Good luck comes to those who know how to wait.\" It had certainly come to George Brendon, or, as he was now called, George Vane. Lord Derrington could not make enough of him. After the interview with Bawdsey the young man called at St. Giles Square and related to his grandfather all he had learned. The old man was much astonished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Ireland was to blame,\" he said, \"not even in holding his tongue. After all, the thing was an accident, although undoubtedly that woman was the cause. Have you seen Ireland?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not yet, but I will soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then tell him from me that I don\u0027t consider he was responsible, and that I quite believe from what I know of Mrs. Jersey that he has told the entire truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will, sir,\" answered George. \"I suppose you mean that if he really committed the crime with malice aforethought Mrs. Jersey would have blackmailed him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lord Derrington nodded approvingly. \"You are what the Scotch call \u0027quick in the uptake,\u0027 George. That is what I mean. Mrs. Jersey must have been afraid for herself or she would never have kept her claws off Ireland\u0027s money. She had plenty of mine,\" added the old gentleman, grimly. \"Bad lot, George!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I quite agree with you, sir. Poor Bawdsey was honest, however.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well--\" Lord Derrington did not assent immediately to this--\"if Bawdsey had been really honest he would have asked me to be silent on the matter, and need not have used threats, however unwilling he was to carry them out. No, George, Bawdsey is like the serpent in the bamboo, straight so long as it is kept in check. I suppose he will marry the girl?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so. He is madly in love with her. I promised that you would give him a thousand pounds if he went to America.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The deuce you did!\" said Derrington, wrathfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not, sir?\" rejoined Brendon, calmly. \"We want him out of our lives. He knows too much. Better send him abroad, so that he may not make any remark about this unpleasant family history.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lord Derrington winced. George certainly had rather an unpleasant way of putting things. However, the old man silently acknowledged the justice of the speech. \"You are right,\" he said. \"But Bawdsey ought to do something for his money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean that he ought to discover the assassin?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I do. Whosoever killed that woman should be brought to justice, George.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Brendon looked down. \"I think it will be best to let sleeping dogs lie, sir,\" he said significantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because of some scandal,\" said Derrington, looking hard at him. \"Are you alluding to the possibility of Mrs. Ward having killed her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this supposition George laughed right out. \"No, sir. I don\u0027t think Mrs. Ward would go so far as that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She would, were there no law to restrain her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I dare say. She has the instincts of a female despot. But as there is a law she would not jeopardize her neck. No, I mean Ireland.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Derrington sat up. \"Nonsense! Do you mean to say he is guilty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, but Bawdsey has an idea,\" and George related the theory of the detective. Derrington grunted in a disgusted manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The man\u0027s a born idiot,\" he said. \"Why should Ireland run the risk of getting his neck into a noose for a second crime? If he thought that she would leave a confession behind inculpating him, he would have waited to make certain. I don\u0027t believe there is a word of truth in the matter. However, when you see him, you can question him about his doings on that night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall certainly do that,\" replied Brendon, quietly, \"but failing Ireland (and his guilt is presumed by Bawdsey) there remains Margery.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That idiot of a girl! Yes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George detailed his reasons for believing in Margery\u0027s guilt. Again Derrington sniffed. \"It\u0027s all supposition. If the girl came into the room, if the stiletto were on the table, if Mrs. Jersey scolded her into a fury. Pah! I don\u0027t believe it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you really wish to find the assassin?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to know, out of mere curiosity. But if it is your opinion that things should be left as they are, why, Bawdsey can take his thousand pounds and sail for America whenever he chooses. But I grudge setting the rascal up in business,\" added Derrington who was still sore about the way in which he had been threatened. \\n\\n \\n\\n After this conversation George took his leave. Dorothy was out of town, so he could not visit her. After the interview with Ireland in Derrington\u0027s library, Mrs. Ward had found it convenient to go down the country. She felt that she was in an unpleasant position. Not that there was any danger of her being accused of murdering Vane. But if the police got hold of the story they might make inquiries--in fact, they certainly would make inquiries--and then the disagreeable fact would come out that Miss Bull was her sister. Mrs. Ward knew that she had not behaved well to Jenny, and that if the truth were known her friends would blame her. \\n\\n \\n\\n As Mrs. Ward did not like blame, and disliked to have her actions criticised, she went down the country, saying to Dorothy she desired a change of air. Lord Derrington wrote a note to Mrs. Ward after George had departed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll ask her to come up,\" said Derrington, grimly, as he sealed the letter. \"George will return in three days with the copy of the marriage certificate and with news of how that case has been disposed of. Mrs. Ward shall apologize to him and formally consent to the marriage. Dorothy shall come also. And Walter\"--Derrington rubbed his hands, chuckling. He was rather anxious to see Walter\u0027s face when he heard that he was no longer the heir. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meantime George went with Kowlaski and Bawdsey to Chelmsford to see after Lola. Kowlaski was in despair, as if Lola received a term of imprisonment his ballet would be brought to an untimely end. Now that Lola was out of the bill, the hall was not so full as usual, and Kowlaski foresaw that if Lola did not come back he would lose money. He therefore went down prepared to spend a large sum to set her free. \\n\\n \\n\\n But there was no need for fear. Lola was brought up before the magistrates, and evidence was given as to her excitable nature. The old sexton produced the torn register and detailed how he had been assaulted. He thought the lady was queer, himself. Kowlaski went into the box, also Bawdsey and George. The result of their evidence as to Lola\u0027s foreign ways was that the magistrate admonished her and inflicted a small fine. This was triumphantly paid by Kowlaski, who returned to town with his principal dancer under his jealous eye. \\n\\n \\n\\n More than that, Kowlaski made quite a story out of the events. It was known in London that Lola Velez had been arrested, as all the London papers copied the account of the trial which had appeared in the country press. Kowlaski put it about that Lola had gone off her head owing to grief for her dying mother. Few people believed this, but the public was so pleased to see the favorite again that she was saluted with cheers. In a few days every one forgot about the matter, which, after all, did not amount to much. \\n\\n \\n\\n Luckily it was not stated why Lola had wished to destroy the register. There were several marriage entries on the page, and no one could say which of these she wished obliterated. Besides, Brendon got the magistrate to suppress the book, and not let the press report the matter. He accomplished this by telling the magistrate exactly how the matter stood. So the judicial authority used his power, and the fourth estate quailed. Everything was settled in a most satisfactory manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n Later on Brendon had copies made of the marriage entry of Percy Vane, Bachelor, and Rosina Lockwood, Spinster, and brought them to his grandfather. The old man read them carefully, then laid down the paper with a sigh of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never thought I would be pleased to see that in black and white,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And are you pleased now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I am. You are to revive the glories of the Derrington Vane family. They have faded of late, but you, sir----\" He clapped his grandson on the back, and George laughed at the old man\u0027s enthusiasm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is one strange thing,\" he said after a pause. \"Seeing that my parents were married so near London I cannot understand how the marriage was not discovered before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Derrington looked thoughtful also. \"It is strange,\" he admitted, \"but you remember the tale of Poe\u0027s Purloined Letter. People always look in the most unlikely places first, and because the church was so near to town and nobody had replied to the advertisement, they--the searchers, I mean--must have thought that the marriage took place in some moorland parish where people never looked at the journals. It was the very closeness of Wargrove church to London, George, that prevented the certificate being discovered sooner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose you are right,\" said Brendon, \"but it does seem strange.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Everything in life is strange,\" said Derrington, \"and not the least strange thing is that I kick out Walter to make room for you. By the way, George, he will be here soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you told him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and he wants to see you about the matter. I said that he could in my presence. What he has to say I don\u0027t know. There is another reason for your remaining, George. Mrs. Ward and her daughter are coming here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She won\u0027t be pleased to see me,\" said Brendon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I think she will. After Ireland put her in a corner she grew afraid, and now she would like to see the matter settled at any price. When she is your mother-in-law, George, keep her out of your house or there will be trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must stand sentinel, sir. She won\u0027t come near me then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Egad, that\u0027s true. She is afraid of me. I hold that stiletto, you see, and I know about her doings at San Remo. The minx!\" said Derrington with great vigor. \"I wonder that her daughter is so charming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So good, you mean,\" said George, fondly, whereat Derrington gave a sigh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, love--love, and again--love,\" said he. \"It seems I am going to have a most sentimental time with you two.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be at rest, sir. Neither Dorothy nor I am sentimental. We are too serious for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s worse. I hate serious lovers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then we will be gay,\" said George, with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t overdo it,\" replied Derrington, with a kindly smile; \"be as you are, both of you, and I shall not complain. Ah, here is Walter! Well, my boy, have you come to see your new cousin?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter Vane entered the library with an injured air. He looked neater and more fragile than ever, and wonderfully old, considering his years. Derrington looked from him to the fine figure of George, with a queer look in his eyes. \"No one would ever take you for relatives,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, they say we are like one another,\" said Walter. \"Mrs. Ward remarked on the likeness when we dined with her. I wondered why we should resemble one another, but it is explained now,\" and Walter cast a not unkindly look in his cousin\u0027s direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Derrington snarled. \"George is like me, and you take after your father, Walter, who was a shrimp if ever there was one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George hastened to the rescue of his cousin. \"It seems to me that the conversation is getting somewhat personal,\" he remarked. \"Walter, I hope you bear me no grudge for stepping into your shoes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter took the hand in his own limp grasp. \"Well, of course it is hard on a fellow,\" he answered in a rather whining manner, \"but you and I got on well together, so I would rather it was you than another fellow. That Train friend of yours, for instance. He\u0027s such a cad!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But a very good fellow for all that,\" said Brendon, dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, people always say that of a fellow who has nothing to recommend him,\" retorted Walter; \"but as you are to be the head of the family I am glad you are not a bounder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s very kind of you,\" said George, dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And very silly of Walter,\" growled the grandfather. \"What do you mean, sir, by talking rubbish? Is it likely that any one of my blood would be what you call a bounder?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Walter, pacifying the old man. \"I only mean----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind what you mean. It\u0027s sure to be something foolish. This,\" said Derrington, pointing with his cane to George, \"is the future head of our family. Pay him all respect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get on capitally,\" said George, clapping Walter on the back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what about my income?\" asked Walter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will have what you have now,\" said Derrington; \"don\u0027t bother me about the matter. You and George can settle it between you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Considering how he had been ousted, Walter really took things very calmly. But he had not enough vigor to protest. He sighed. His grandfather had cowed him, and Walter profoundly admired his newly found cousin, who did not hesitate to stand up to the despot. He began to think it was a good thing that George had come into the family. He would at least save him--Walter--from constant bullying. This interesting family council was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Ward, as pert and pretty as ever. She had quite recovered her spirits, and knowing that Derrington would say nothing about the card-cheating or about the San Remo matter, she was prepared to be as insolent as she dared. But she was quite determined not to cross swords again with the old man. Like a burnt child she dreaded the fire. Derrington was altogether too much, even for her. \\n\\n \\n\\n As it was, she came sailing in with the prettiest air in the world, and held out both hands, her head on one side like a sick canary. \"My dear Lord Derrington, how well you are looking! How\"--here her astonished eyes fell on George. \"You!\" said Mrs. Ward, aghast. \"Mr. Brendon! and here!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not Mr. Brendon,\" said Derrington enjoying her confusion, \"but my grandson, George Vane.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dorothy, who had remained below to give some instructions to the footman, entered the room just in time to hear this announcement. She flew to her lover. \"My dearest George, I am glad, glad, so glad,\" and before them all she kissed him. Mrs. Ward screamed: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dorothy! What manners!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good manners,\" said Derrington, coolly, \"seeing that they are natural. Well, Mrs. Ward, George--my grandson, and heir,\" added the old man with emphasis, \"has something to say to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Really. I shall be most happy to hear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George took his cue. \"I have to ask you for the hand of your daughter Dorothy,\" he said, looking very proud and manly as he stood with the girl\u0027s hand within his own. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Really,\" said Mrs. Ward again, \"I don\u0027t know. I fancied that Walter, you see----\" And she cast her eyes on the neat little man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I scratch,\" said Walter, in his elegant way. \"There\u0027s no fighting against George. He has all the luck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You call him George?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t I? He\u0027s my cousin; the head of the house----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I go to my long home,\" finished Derrington. \"Well, Mrs. Ward, do you consent to the match?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do, mother,\" said Dorothy, imploringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward sank into a chair and pretended to be overcome by emotion. In fact, she did this merely to gain time, as she did not wish to answer too quickly. It was plain that Walter, whom she had wished Dorothy to marry, took, in her own phraseology, \"a back seat.\" George was promoted vice Walter resigned. George would be Lord Derrington and would have the money. He was an obstinate man, certainly, and would be difficult to manage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, she might be able to get the better of him. She could always work him through Dorothy, if Dorothy would only get over her absurd notions of religion and all that sort of thing. On the whole Mrs. Ward thought it was best to agree. Knowing what Derrington knew, and how obstinate both lovers were, she did not see very well what else she could do. However, she made the most of her compulsory surrender. After a few sighs, and having squeezed a few tears, she cried to her daughter, in a muffled voice, expressive of deep emotion, \"Dorothy, my dear child.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dorothy, with a look at George, went and knelt down by her mother\u0027s chair. She was not the dupe of this play-acting, but, knowing that her mother would insist on making an effective scene, wished to get it over as speedily as possible. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward put her hand on Dorothy\u0027s shoulder in a maternal manner. \"Do you love George?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Dorothy, simply, \"you know I love him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George, do you love my child?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do,\" replied George, curtly, while Derrington surveyed this touching scene with a grim smile. He always loved to watch the antics of Mrs. Ward. She believed in them so thoroughly herself, and they deceived no one gifted with ordinary intelligence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is hard,\" said Mrs. Ward with a deep sigh, \"to see a child leave its parent. But you love her, you have won her;\" here she rose, and raising Dorothy from her knees gave her to George. \"Take her, George, and with her take a mother\u0027s blessing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The idea of Mrs. Ward\u0027s blessing was too much for Walter, and he went off into a shriek of laughter, which ended in his leaving the room. George was quite unmoved. He thanked Mrs. Ward and kissed Dorothy. Then he took her to a distant seat near the window, where they could talk sensibly. Lord Derrington was left to console the afflicted mother. This he proceeded to do immediately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Egad, you did it well!\" he said, looking at the pretty woman. \"I don\u0027t believe Miss Terry or Mrs. Siddons could have done it better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward flushed a little, but still kept up the pose. \"Nature spoke, my dear Lord Derrington. I am aware that you consider Nature vulgar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was not aware that I did. I see so little of it, that your scene touched me--positively touched me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward saw that it was useless to hide the truth from this keen-eyed old man any longer. \"Oh, don\u0027t be nasty,\" she said plaintively, and rustled up to him. \"Of course, I wanted Dorothy to marry Walter, but George does just as well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think she has made a bad exchange, Mrs. Ward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s good-looking enough,\" said the little woman, \"but so serious and dull. Of course, I suppose you\u0027ll allow him an income.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He shall have all that is necessary to keep up his position as my heir,\" said Derrington dryly. \"I hope he and Dorothy will live here. The house is big enough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And they won\u0027t have to pay any rent, which is always a consideration, isn\u0027t it? Oh, I hope dear Dorothy will be happy. I shall see much of her--much of my darling child.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Derrington, thinking it just as well to nip these plans in the bud, \"you care very little about Dorothy, and you don\u0027t like George. When they are married you must stop away as much as is consistent with your feelings.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do what I like,\" said Mrs. Ward, beginning to tap her foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think you will. You threatened me in this room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was only playing a game,\" protested Mrs. Ward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I can play a game also. Mrs. Jersey has left behind her a confession in which she details how you managed to cheat your sister, Miss Bull. If you don\u0027t leave that couple severely alone I shall show the confession to Dorothy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You would never be so cruel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I would,\" replied Derrington, who had not the slightest intention of fulfilling his threat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never did anything to my sister. Mrs. Jersey tells lies----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Derrington made a gesture of disgust. \"There--there,\" he said, \"what is the use of talking further? Things are settled. When Dorothy and George are married I\u0027ll see what I can do for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward\u0027s face became wreathed with smiles. She was such a frivolous, heartless little woman that she could change from one mood to another with wonderful rapidity. \"Oh, thank you, dear Lord Derrington,\" she said artlessly, and pressing his arm. \"I know you are the most generous of men. But I really can\u0027t stop talking here all day.\" She rustled over to Dorothy. \"My darling, I must go and do some shopping. No, you can stay here. I will call again in an hour. George,\" she presented her cheek, \"you can kiss your mother-in-law.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George did so, delicately, so as not to spoil the tint of the cheek. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Ward departed. \"He\u0027s like a block of wood,\" she said to herself; \"never did a man kiss me so coldly before. Ugh! The bear!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1826/53006.html","bookId":1021,"book":{"id":1021,"title":"The Yellow Holly","description":"简介： She did not put the sacramental phrase on her cards, as no invitations were sent out.
