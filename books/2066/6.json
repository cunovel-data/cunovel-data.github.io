{"id":111000,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The next morning was clear and hot again, another beautiful summer day. Elena stretched lazily in her comfy bed, then pul ed on a T-shirt and shorts and padded down to the kitchen for a bowl of cereal.\\n\\n Aunt Judith was braiding Margaret\u0027s hair at the table.\\n\\n \"Morning,\" Elena said, pouring milk into her bowl.\\n\\n \"Hi, sleepyhead,\" said Aunt Judith, and Margaret gave her a big smile and a finger-wiggling wave. \"Keep stil , Margaret. We\u0027re about to leave for the market,\" she told Elena. \"What are you doing today?\"\\n\\n Elena swal owed her mouthful of cereal. \"We\u0027re going to pick up Alaric and his friend at the train station and just hang out and catch up,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Who?\" Aunt Judith asked, her eyes narrowing. Elena\u0027s mind spun. \"Oh, uh, you remember, he subbed for Mr. Tanner teaching history last year,\" she said, wondering if that was in fact true in this world. Aunt Judith frowned. \"Isn\u0027t he a little old to be socializing with high school girls?\"\\n\\n Elena rol ed her eyes. \"We\u0027re not in high school anymore, Aunt Judith. And he\u0027s only about six years older than us. And it\u0027s not just girls. Matt and Stefan are coming, too.\"\\n\\n If this was Aunt Judith\u0027s reaction to the news of their spending time with Alaric, Elena could tel why Meredith was hesitant to tel people about their relationship. It made sense to wait a couple of years, until people thought of her as a grown-up. Since no one here knew al that Meredith had seen and done, she seemed like any other eighteenyear-old to them. It\u0027s a good thing Aunt Judith doesn\u0027t know Stefan\u0027s five hundred years older than I am, Elena thought with a secret smirk. She thinks Alaric\u0027s too old.\\n\\n The doorbel rang.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Matt and everybody,\" Elena said, rising to put her bowl in the sink. \"See you guys tonight.\"\\n\\n Margaret widened her eyes at Elena in silent appeal, and Elena detoured on her way to the door to squeeze the little girl\u0027s shoulder. Was Margaret stil worried Elena wouldn\u0027t come back?\\n\\n Out in the foyer, she ran her fingers through her hair before opening the door.\\n\\n Standing in front of her was not Stefan, though, but a perfect stranger. A real y good-looking stranger, Elena noted automatical y, a boy about her age with curly golden hair, sculpted features, and bright blue eyes. He was holding a deep red rose in one hand.\\n\\n Elena stood a little straighter, unconsciously pul ing her shoulders back and pushing her hair behind her ears. She adored Stefan, but that didn\u0027t mean she couldn\u0027t look at other boys, or talk to them. She wasn\u0027t dead, after al . Not anymore, she thought, smiling at her private joke. The boy smiled back. \"Hey, Elena,\" he said cheerful y.\\n\\n \"Caleb Smal wood!\" Aunt Judith said, coming into the hal . \"There you are!\"\\n\\n Elena felt herself recoil, but she kept the smile on her face. \"Any relation to Tyler?\" she said, outwardly calm, and ran her eyes over him, trying to be subtle, checking for... for what? For signs of his being a werewolf? She realized she didn\u0027t even know what those would be. Tyler\u0027s good looks had always had a flavor of an animal about them, with his large white teeth and broad features, but had that been a coincidence?\\n\\n \"Tyler\u0027s my cousin,\" Caleb answered, his smile beginning to turn to a quizzical frown. \"I thought you knew that, Elena. I\u0027m staying with his folks while Tyler\u0027s... gone.\"\\n\\n Elena\u0027s mind raced. Tyler Smal wood had run away after Elena, Stefan, and Damon had defeated his al y, the evil vampire Klaus. Tyler had left his girlfriend - and sometimes hostage - Caroline pregnant. Elena hadn\u0027t discussed Tyler and Caroline\u0027s fate with the Guardians, so she had no idea what had happened with them in this reality. Was Tyler even a werewolf now? Was Caroline pregnant? And if she was, was it with werewolf or human babies? She shook her head slightly. Brave new world, indeed.\\n\\n \"Wel , don\u0027t leave Caleb out on the porch. Let him in,\"\\n\\n Aunt Judith instructed from behind her. Elena stood aside, and Caleb moved past her into the hal .\\n\\n Elena tried to reach out with her mind and sense Caleb\u0027s aura, to read him to see if he was dangerous, but once again came up against that brick wal . It would take some time to get used to being a normal girl again, and suddenly Elena felt horribly vulnerable.\\n\\n Caleb shifted from foot to foot, looking uncomfortable, and she quickly composed herself. \"How long have you been in town?\" she asked, and then kicked herself for treating this boy she obviously was supposed to know like a stranger again.\\n\\n \"Wel ,\" he said slowly, \"I\u0027ve been in town al summer. Did you hit your head over the weekend, Elena?\" He grinned teasingly at her.\\n\\n Elena lifted a shoulder, thinking of al she had suffered over the weekend. \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n He held out the rose. \"This must be for you.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Elena, confused. A thorn pricked her finger as she took it by the stem, and she stuck the finger in her mouth to stanch the blood.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t thank me,\" he said. \"It was just sitting on the front steps when I got here. You must have a secret admirer.\"\\n\\n Elena frowned. Plenty of boys had admired her through school, and if this had been nine months ago, she could have made a good guess at who would leave her a rose. But now she didn\u0027t have a clue.\\n\\n Matt\u0027s battered old Ford sedan pul ed up outside and honked. \"I\u0027ve got to run, Aunt Judith,\" she said. \"They\u0027re here. Nice seeing you, Caleb.\"\\n\\n Elena\u0027s stomach twisted as she walked toward Matt\u0027s car. It wasn\u0027t just the strangeness of meeting Caleb that was affecting her, she realized, turning the rose\u0027s stem absently between her fingers. It was the car itself. Matt\u0027s old Ford was the car she had driven off Wickery Bridge back in the winter, panicked and pursued by evil forces. She\u0027d died in this car. The windows had shattered as she hit the creek, and the car had fil ed with icy water. The scratched steering wheel and the dented hood of the car, covered with water, had been the last things she\u0027d seen in that life.\\n\\n But here the car was - as whole again as she was. Pushing the memory of her death from her mind, she waved at Bonnie, whose eager face was visible through the passenger window. She could forget about al those old tragedies, because now they had never happened. Meredith perched elegantly on the swing on her front porch, pushing herself gently back and forth with one foot. Her strong, tapered fingers were stil ; her dark hair fel smoothly across her shoulders; her expression was as serene as ever.\\n\\n There was nothing about Meredith that might show how tensely and busily her thoughts were churning, worries and contingency plans whirring away behind her cool facade. She had spent yesterday trying to figure out what the Guardians\u0027 spel had changed for her and her family -\\n\\n particularly her brother, Christian, who Klaus had kidnapped over a decade ago. She stil didn\u0027t understand it al , but it was dawning on her that Elena\u0027s bargain had more far-reaching consequences than any of them had imagined.\\n\\n But today her thoughts were occupied with Alaric Saltzman.\\n\\n Her fingers tapped anxiously against the arm of the swing. Then she schooled herself into stil ness again. Self-discipline was where Meredith found her strength, and if Alaric, her boyfriend - or at least, he had been her boyfriend... actual y her perhaps engaged-to-be-engaged, sort of almost fiance, before he left town - turned out to have changed toward her in the months they\u0027d been apart, wel , no one, not even Alaric, would see how that would hurt her.\\n\\n Alaric had spent the past several months in Japan, investigating paranormal activity, a dream come true for a doctoral student in parapsychology. His study of the tragic history of Unmei no Shima, the Island of Doom, a smal community where children and parents had turned against one another, had helped Meredith and her friends to understand what the kitsune were doing to Fel \u0027s Church, and how to fight it.\\n\\n Alaric had been working at Unmei no Shima with Dr. Celia Connor, a forensic pathologist who, despite her ful academic credentials, was the same age as Alaric, only twenty-four. So, clearly, Dr. Connor was bril iant. From his letters and emails, Alaric had been having the time of his life in Japan. And he\u0027d certainly found a lot of interests in common with Dr. Connor. Perhaps more so than with Meredith, who had only just graduated from a smal -town high school, no matter how mature and intel igent she might be.\\n\\n Meredith gave herself a mental shake and sat up straighter. She was being ridiculous, worrying about Alaric\u0027s relationship with his col eague. She was pretty sure she was being ridiculous, anyway. Fairly sure. She gripped the arms of the swing more tightly. She was a vampire hunter. She had a duty to protect her town, and she had, with her friends, protected it wel already. She wasn\u0027t just an ordinary teenager, and if she needed to prove that to Alaric again, she was confident she could, Dr. Celia Connor or no Dr. Celia Connor.\\n\\n Matt\u0027s rattletrap of an old Ford sedan chugged up to the curb, Bonnie in front with Matt, Stefan and Elena sitting close together in the back. Meredith rose and crossed the lawn toward it.\\n\\n \"Is everything okay?\" said Bonnie, round eyed, when she opened the door. \"Your face looks like you\u0027re heading off to battle.\"\\n\\n Meredith smoothed her features into impassivity and scrambled for an explanation that wasn\u0027t, I\u0027m worried about whether my boyfriend still likes me. Quickly and easily, she realized there was another reason she was tense, a true one.\\n\\n \"Bonnie, I have a duty to help look out for everyone now,\"\\n\\n Meredith said simply. \"Damon\u0027s dead. Stefan doesn\u0027t want to hurt humans, and that handicaps him. Elena\u0027s Powers are gone. Even though the kitsune were defeated, we stil need protection. We\u0027l always need to be careful.\"\\n\\n Stefan tightened his arm around Elena\u0027s shoulders. \"The things that make Fel \u0027s Church so appealing to the supernatural, the ley lines that have attracted al kinds of beings here for generations, are al stil here. I can sense them. And other people, other creatures, wil sense them, too.\"\\n\\n Bonnie\u0027s voice rose in alarm. \"So it\u0027s al going to happen again?\"\\n\\n Stefan rubbed the bridge of his nose. \"I don\u0027t think so. But something else might. Meredith\u0027s right, we have to be vigilant.\" He dropped a kiss onto Elena\u0027s shoulder and rested his cheek against her hair. There was no question, Meredith thought wryly, why this particular supernatural being was drawn to Fel \u0027s Church, anyway, and it wasn\u0027t because of the ley lines running through the area. Elena toyed with a single dark red rose, something Stefan must have brought her. \"Is that the only reason you\u0027re worried, Meredith?\" she asked lightly. \"Your duty to Fel \u0027s Church?\"\\n\\n Meredith felt herself flush a little, but her voice was dry and calm. \"I think that\u0027s reason enough, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Elena grinned. \"Oh, it\u0027s reason enough, I suppose. But could there be another one?\" She winked at Bonnie, whose anxious expression lightened in response. \"Who do we know who wil be fascinated by al the tales you have to tel ?\\n\\n Especially when he finds out that the story\u0027s not over yet?\"\\n\\n Bonnie turned al the way around in her seat, her smile growing. \"Oh. Oh. I see. He won\u0027t be able to think of anything else, wil he? Or anyone else.\"\\n\\n Now Stefan\u0027s shoulders relaxed, and up in the driver\u0027s seat Matt let out a chuckle and shook his head. \"You three,\"\\n\\n he said affectionately. \"Us guys never stood a chance.\"\\n\\n Meredith looked straight ahead and lifted her chin slightly, ignoring them al . Elena and Bonnie knew her too wel , and the three of them had spent enough time scheming together that she should have known they\u0027d see through her plan in a minute. But she didn\u0027t have to admit to it.\\n\\n The solemn mood in the car had lifted, though. Meredith realized they were al doing it on purpose, reaching out gently and careful y with jokes and lighthearted teasing, trying to ease the pain Elena and Stefan must both be feeling.\\n\\n Damon was dead. And while Meredith had developed a cautious, wary respect for the unpredictable vampire during their time in the Dark Dimension, and Bonnie had felt, Meredith thought, something warmer, Elena had loved him. Real y loved him. And even though Damon and Stefan\u0027s relationship had been rocky, to say the least, for centuries, he had been Stefan\u0027s brother. Stefan and Elena were hurting, and everyone knew it.\\n\\n After a minute, Matt\u0027s eyes flicked up to the rearview mirror to glance at Stefan. \"Hey,\" he said, \"I forgot to tel you. In this reality you didn\u0027t disappear on Hal oween - you stayed the starting wide receiver and we took the footbal team al the way to the state championships.\" He grinned, and Stefan\u0027s face opened in simple pleasure. Meredith had almost forgotten that Stefan had played with Matt on their high school footbal team before their history teacher, Mr. Tanner, died at the Hal oween haunted house and everything went to hel . She had forgotten he and Matt had been real friends, playing sports and hanging out, despite the fact that they\u0027d both loved Elena. And maybe still do both love Elena? she wondered, and glanced quickly at the back of Matt\u0027s head from under her eyelashes. She wasn\u0027t sure how Matt felt, but he had always struck her as the kind of guy who, when he fel in love, stayed in love. But he was also the kind of guy who would always be too honorable to try to break up a relationship, no matter what he felt.\\n\\n \"And,\" Matt went on, \"as the quarterback of the state champions, I guess I\u0027m a pretty good prospect for col eges.\" He paused and broke out in a wide, proud smile.\\n\\n \"Apparently, I have a ful athletic scholarship to Kent State.\"\\n\\n Bonnie squealed, Elena clapped, and Meredith and Stefan burst out with congratulations.\\n\\n \"Me, me now!\" Bonnie said. \"I guess I studied harder in this reality. Which was probably easier, since one of my best friends didn\u0027t die first semester and was available to help tutor me.\"\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Elena said. \"Meredith was always a better tutor than me. You can\u0027t blame it on me.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" Bonnie continued, \"I got into a four-year col ege! I didn\u0027t even bother to apply to any in our other life because my GPA was not high. I was going to take nursing classes at the community col ege like Mary did, even though I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m real y cut out to be a nurse because, yuck, blood and other fluids. But, anyway, my mom was saying this morning that we should go shopping for my room at Dalcrest before Labor Day.\" She shrugged a little.\\n\\n \"I mean, I know it\u0027s not Harvard, but I\u0027m pretty excited.\"\\n\\n Meredith joined in the congratulations quietly. She had, in fact, gotten into Harvard.\\n\\n \"Ooh. And! And!\" Bonnie was bouncing in her seat with excitement. \"I ran into Vickie Bennett this morning. She\u0027s definitely not dead! I think she was surprised when I hugged her. I forgot we weren\u0027t real y friends.\"\\n\\n \"How is she?\" asked Elena interestedly. \"Did she remember anything?\"\\n\\n Bonnie tilted her head. \"She seems fine. I couldn\u0027t exactly ask her what she remembered, but she didn\u0027t say anything about being dead or vampires or anything. I mean, she was always a little bit blah, you know? She did tel me she saw you downtown last weekend and you told her what color lip gloss she ought to buy.\"\\n\\n Elena raised her eyebrows. \"Real y?\" She paused and went on uncertainly, \"Is anybody else feeling weird about al of this? I mean, it\u0027s wonderful - don\u0027t get me wrong. But it\u0027s weird, too.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s confusing,\" Bonnie said. \"I\u0027m grateful, obviously, that al the horrible things are gone and everybody\u0027s okay. I\u0027m thril ed to have my life back. But my father blew up at me this morning when I asked where Mary was.\" Mary was one of Bonnie\u0027s older sisters, the last one living at home besides Bonnie. \"He thought I was trying to be funny. Apparently she moved in with her boyfriend three months ago, and you can imagine how my dad feels about that.\"\\n\\n Meredith nodded. Bonnie\u0027s dad was the protective paternal type, and pretty old-fashioned in his attitudes toward his daughters\u0027 boyfriends. If Mary was living with her boyfriend, he must be apoplectic.\\n\\n \"Aunt Judith and I have been fighting - at least, I think so. But I can\u0027t find out exactly why,\" Elena confessed. \"I can\u0027t ask, because obviously I should already know.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t everything be perfect now?\" Bonnie said wistful y. \"It seems like we\u0027ve been through enough.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind being confused, as long as we can go back to real life,\" Matt said earnestly.\\n\\n There was a little pause, which Meredith broke, reaching for something to take them out of their somber thoughts.\\n\\n \"Pretty rose, Elena,\" she said. \"Is that a gift from Stefan?\"\\n\\n \"No, actual y,\" Elena said. \"It was sitting on my front stoop this morning.\" She twirled it between her fingers. \"It\u0027s not from any of the gardens on our street, though. No one has such beautiful roses.\" She smiled teasingly at Stefan, who tensed up once more. \"It\u0027s a mystery.\"\\n\\n \"Must be from a secret admirer,\" Bonnie said. \"Can I see?\"\\n\\n Elena handed it up to the front seat, and Bonnie turned the stem around careful y in her hand, looking at the blossom from al angles. \"It\u0027s gorgeous,\" she said. \"A single, perfect rose. How romantic!\" She pretended to swoon, lifting the rose to her forehead. Then she flinched.\\n\\n \"Ouch! Ouch!\"\\n\\n Blood ran down her hand. Much more blood than ought to come from the prick of a thorn, Meredith noted, already reaching into her pocket for a tissue. Matt pul ed off the road.\\n\\n \"Bonnie - \" he began.\\n\\n Stefan breathed in sharply and leaned forward, his eyes widening. Meredith forgot about the tissue, fearing the sudden sight of blood had caused Stefan\u0027s vampiric nature to take over.\\n\\n Then Matt gasped and Elena said sharply, \"A camera, quick! Someone give me your phone!\" with such a tone of command that Meredith automatical y handed Elena her phone.\\n\\n As Elena pointed the camera phone at Bonnie, Meredith final y saw what had startled the others.\\n\\n The dark red blood was running down Bonnie\u0027s arm, and as it ran, it had streamed into twists and curves from her wrist to her elbow. The trickles of blood spel ed out a name over and over. The same name that had been haunting Meredith for months. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-6.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) \\n The past is never far...
