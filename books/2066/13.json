{"id":111007,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m so sorry,\" Meredith said for the tenth time. Her usual y composed face was flushed, and her eyes were bright with unshed tears. Matt didn\u0027t remember ever seeing her so upset about something, especial y something that had ended up not being a big deal. Sure, Celia could have been hurt, but the car hadn\u0027t touched her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine, real y I am, Meredith,\" Celia assured her again.\\n\\n \"I just didn\u0027t see you. I don\u0027t know how, but I didn\u0027t. Thank God for Alaric,\" Meredith said, throwing a grateful glance at Alaric, who was sitting close beside her and rubbing her back.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay, Meredith,\" he said. \"It\u0027s al okay.\" Alaric seemed more concerned for Meredith than for Celia, and Matt didn\u0027t blame him. Babbling was pretty out of character for Meredith. Alaric wrapped his arms tightly around Meredith, and she visibly relaxed.\\n\\n Celia, on the other hand, tensed noticeably as Meredith leaned into Alaric\u0027s embrace. Matt traded a rueful glance with Bonnie.\\n\\n Then Stefan reached out and stroked Elena\u0027s shoulder absently, and Matt was surprised to feel a jealous pang of his own. Wasn\u0027t he ever going to get over Elena Gilbert? It had been more than a year since they dated, and about a century in experience.\\n\\n Bonnie was stil watching him, now with a speculative gleam in her eyes, and Matt shot her a bland smile. He\u0027d just as soon not know what Bonnie saw in his face when he looked at Elena and Stefan.\\n\\n \"Around this bend and up the slope is the Plunge,\" he said to Celia, ushering her forward along the trail. \"It\u0027s a little bit of a hike, but it\u0027s the best place around here for a picnic.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely the best,\" said Bonnie cheerily. \"We can jump down the waterfal .\" She fel in on Celia\u0027s other side, helping him to herd her away from the two couples, who were murmuring to one another softly as they fol owed behind.\\n\\n \"Is that safe?\" asked Celia dubiously.\\n\\n \"Total y,\" said Bonnie. \"Everybody jumps the waterfal here, and nobody\u0027s ever gotten hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Usual y it\u0027s safe,\" said Matt, more cautiously. \"You and Meredith might want to think about not swimming, Celia.\"\\n\\n \"I hate this,\" Bonnie said. \"I hate having to be extracareful because of some dark thing that we don\u0027t know anything about. Everything should be normal.\"\\n\\n Normal or not, it was a magnificent picnic. They spread their blankets on the rocks near the top of the waterfal . The smal fal s plummeted down the side of the cliff and ended in a deep pool of effervescent water, making a sort of natural fountain that spil ed into a clear bronze-green pool. Mrs. Flowers had packed salads and breads and desserts for them, as wel as meat and corn to gril on a hibachi Stefan had brought from the boardinghouse. They had more than enough food for a couple days of camping, let alone one lunch. Elena had stowed cold drinks in a cooler, and, after hiking up the trail in the Virginia summer heat, everyone was happy to crack open a lemonade or soda.\\n\\n Even Stefan took a water bottle and drank as he started heating the gril , although it was automatical y understood by everyone that he would not be eating. Matt had always found the fact that he never saw Stefan eating a little creepy, even before Matt knew he was a vampire. The girls squirmed out of jeans and tops to display their bathing suits, like caterpil ars transforming into butterflies. Meredith was tan and lean in a black one-piece. Bonnie was wearing a petite mermaid-green bikini. Elena wore a soft gold bandeau that went with her hair. Matt watched Stefan watching her appreciatively, and felt that little twist of jealousy again.\\n\\n Both Elena and Bonnie pul ed their T-shirts back on over their bathing suits almost immediately. They always did: Their pale skin burned instead of tanned. Celia lounged on a towel, looking spectacular in a casual yet daringly cut white swimsuit. The effect of the pure white against Celia\u0027s coffee-colored skin was amazing. Matt noticed Meredith\u0027s eyes passing over her and then glancing sharply at Alaric. But Alaric was too busy shucking down to a pair of red trunks. Stefan stayed out of the direct sunlight, remaining in his dark jeans and black T-shirt.\\n\\n Wasn\u0027t that a little creepy, too? Matt thought. Stefan\u0027s ring protected him from the sun\u0027s rays, didn\u0027t it? Did he stil have to stick to the shadows? And what was with the black clothing? Was he pretending to be Damon now? Matt frowned at the thought: One Damon had been more than enough.\\n\\n Matt shook his head, stretched his arms and legs, turned his face toward the sun, and tried to get rid of his thoughts. He liked Stefan. He always had. Stefan was a good guy. A vampire, a dry voice in the back of his mind noted, even a harmless one, can rarely be described as a good guy. Matt ignored the voice.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s jump!\" he said, and headed toward the waterfal .\\n\\n \"Not Meredith,\" said Stefan flatly. \"Not Meredith, and not Celia. You two stay here.\"\\n\\n There was a little silence, and he glanced up from the gril to see his friends staring at him. He kept his face neutral as he returned their gazes. This was a life-or-death situation. It was Stefan\u0027s responsibility now to keep them safe, whether they liked it or not. He looked at them each in turn, holding their eyes. He was not going to back down.\\n\\n Meredith had risen to her feet to fol ow Matt to the fal s\u0027\\n\\n edge, and she hesitated for a moment, clearly unsure how to react. Then her face hardened, and Stefan saw that she had chosen to take a stand.\\n\\n She stepped toward him. \"I\u0027m sorry, Stefan,\" she said, her voice level. \"I know you\u0027re worried, but I\u0027m going to do what I decide I want to do. I can look after myself.\"\\n\\n She moved to join Matt, who was standing at the edge of the cliff, but Stefan\u0027s hand whipped out to grab her wrist, his fingers as strong as steel. \"No, Meredith,\" he said firmly. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Bonnie\u0027s mouth drop open. Everyone was looking at him with puzzled, anxious faces, and Stefan tried to soften his tone. \"I\u0027m just trying to do what\u0027s best for you.\"\\n\\n Meredith sighed, a long, gusty sound, and seemed to be making an effort to let go of some of her anger. \"I know that, Stefan,\" she said reasonably, \"and I appreciate it. But I can\u0027t go through the world not doing the things I usual y do, just waiting for whatever this is to come get me.\"\\n\\n She tried to move around him, but he sidestepped to block her way again.\\n\\n Meredith glanced at Celia, who threw up her hands and shook her head. \"Don\u0027t look at me,\" Celia said. \"I have no urge to jump off a cliff. I\u0027m just going to lie in the sunshine and let you al work this out yourselves.\" She leaned back on her hands and turned her face toward the sun. Meredith\u0027s eyes narrowed and she whirled back to Stefan. As she was opening her mouth, Elena broke in.\\n\\n \"What if the rest of us go first?\" she suggested placatingly to Stefan. \"We can make sure there\u0027s nothing clearly dangerous down there. And we\u0027l be near her at the bottom. Nobody\u0027s ever been hurt jumping here, not that I\u0027ve heard of. Right, guys?\" Matt and Bonnie nodded in agreement.\\n\\n Stefan felt himself softening. Whenever Elena used her logical voice and her wide, appealing eyes, he found himself agreeing to plans that, in his heart of hearts, he thought were foolhardy.\\n\\n Elena pressed her advantage. \"You could stand right by the water below, too,\" she said. \"Then, if there\u0027s any problem, you could dive in right away. You\u0027re so fast, you\u0027d get there before anything bad could happen.\"\\n\\n Stefan knew this was wrong. He hadn\u0027t forgotten that sick swoop of despair, of realizing he was too slow to save someone. Once again, he saw Damon\u0027s long, graceful leap toward Bonnie that had ended with Damon fal ing to earth, a wooden branch driven through his heart. Damon had died because Stefan was too slow to save him, too slow to realize the danger and save Bonnie himself.\\n\\n He\u0027d also been too late to save Elena when she had driven off the bridge and drowned. The fact that she now lived again didn\u0027t mean he hadn\u0027t failed her then. He remembered her pale hair floating like seaweed in the chil y water of Wickery Creek, her hands stil resting on the steering wheel, her eyes closed, and shuddered. He had dived repeatedly before he found her. She had been so cold and white when he carried her to shore. Stil , he found himself nodding. What Elena wanted, Elena got. He would stand by and protect Meredith as best as he could, and he prayed, as far as a vampire could pray, that it would be enough.\\n\\n The rest of the friends stayed at the top while, down at the bottom of the fal s, Stefan surveyed the pool at his feet. The water sprayed up exuberantly from where the fal s hit the surface. Warm, pale sand encircled the pool\u0027s edges, making a tiny beach, and the center of the pool seemed dark and deep.\\n\\n Matt jumped first, with a long, wavering whoop as he plummeted. The splash as he hit the water was huge, and he seemed to stay submerged for a long time. Stefan leaned forward to watch the water. He couldn\u0027t see through the foam thrown up by the fal s, and an anxious quiver shot through his stomach.\\n\\n He was just thinking of diving in after him when Matt\u0027s sleek wet head broke the surface. \"I touched the bottom!\"\\n\\n he announced, grinning, and shook his head like a dog, throwing glittering drops of water everywhere. He swam toward Stefan, strong tan limbs moving powerful y, and Stefan thought how easy everything seemed for Matt. He was a creature of sunlight and simplicity, while Stefan was stuck in the shadows, living a long half-life of secrets and loneliness. Sure, his sapphire ring let him walk in the sun, but being exposed to the sunlight for a long time, like today, was uncomfortable, as if there were some kind of itch deep inside him. It was worse now that he was readjusting to a diet of animal blood again. His unease was yet another reminder that he didn\u0027t real y belong here. Not the way Matt did.\\n\\n He shrugged off his sour feelings, surprised at their emergence in the first place. Matt was a good friend. He always had been. The daylight must be getting to him. Bonnie jumped next, and surfaced more quickly, coughing and snorting. \"Oof!\" she said. \"I got water up my nose! Ugh!\" She pul ed herself out of the water and perched on a rock near Stefan\u0027s feet. \"You don\u0027t swim?\" she asked him.\\n\\n Stefan was struck with a flash of memory. Damon, tanned and strong, splashing him and laughing in one of his rare fits of good humor. It was hundreds of years ago now. Back when the Salvatore brothers had lived in the sunlight, back before even the great-grandparents of his friends had been born. \"Not for a long time,\" he answered. Elena jumped with the same casual grace as she did everything else, straight as an arrow toward the bottom of the fal s, her gold bathing suit and her golden hair gleaming in the sunshine. She was underwater for longer than Bonnie had been, and again Stefan tensed, watching the pool. When she broke the surface, she gave them a rueful grin. \"I couldn\u0027t quite reach the bottom,\" she said. \"I was stretching and stretching down. I could see the sand, but the water pushed me back up.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t even try,\" Bonnie said. \"I\u0027ve accepted that I\u0027m too short.\"\\n\\n Elena swam away from the bottom of the fal s and climbed onto the sand, settling next to Bonnie at Stefan\u0027s feet. Matt climbed out of the water, too, and stood near the fal s, gazing up critical y. \"Just jump feetfirst, Meredith,\" he cal ed teasingly. \"You\u0027re such a show-off.\"\\n\\n Meredith was poised at the edge of the fal s. She saluted them and then leaped into a perfect swan dive, arching swiftly toward the pool, disappearing smoothly beneath the water with barely a splash.\\n\\n \"She was on the swim team,\" Bonnie said\\n\\n conversational y to Stefan. \"She has a row of ribbons and trophies on a shelf at home.\"\\n\\n Stefan nodded absently, his eyes scanning the water. Surely Meredith\u0027s head would break the surface in a second. The others had taken about this long to reemerge.\\n\\n \"Can I jump yet?\" Alaric cal ed from above.\\n\\n \"No!\" Elena shouted. She rose to her feet and she and Stefan exchanged a worried glance. Meredith had been down there too long.\\n\\n Meredith surfaced, sputtering and pushing her wet hair out of her eyes. Stefan relaxed.\\n\\n \"I did it!\" she cal ed. \"I - \"\\n\\n Her eyes widened and she began to shriek, but her scream was cut off as she was abruptly yanked under the water by something they couldn\u0027t see. In the space of a breath, she was gone.\\n\\n For a moment, Stefan just stared at where Meredith had been, unable to move. Too slow, too slow, an internal voice taunted him, and he pictured Damon\u0027s face, laughing cruel y and saying again, So fragile, Stefan. He couldn\u0027t see Meredith anywhere under the clear, effervescent water. It was as if she had been taken suddenly away. Al of this flew through Stefan\u0027s head in only a heartbeat, and then he dived into the water after her.\\n\\n Underwater, he couldn\u0027t see anything. The white water from the fal s bubbled up, throwing foam and golden sand in front of him.\\n\\n Stefan urgently channeled his Power to his eyes, sharpening his vision, but mostly that just meant that now he could see the individual bubbles of the white water and the grains of sand in sharp relief. Where was Meredith?\\n\\n The bubbling water was trying to push him up to the surface, too. He had to struggle to move forward through the murky water, reaching out. Something brushed his fingers and he grabbed at it, but it was only a handful of slippery pondweed.\\n\\n Where was she? Time was running out. Humans could go without oxygen for only a few minutes before brain damage set in. A few minutes after that, there would be no recovery at al .\\n\\n He remembered Elena\u0027s drowning once more, the frail white shape that he had pul ed from Matt\u0027s wrecked car, ice crystals in her hair. The water here was warm, but would kil Meredith just as surely. He swal owed a sob and reached out frantical y again into the shadowed depths. His fingers found skin, and it moved against his hand. Stefan grasped whatever limb it was, tight enough to bruise, and surged forward. In less than a second more, he could see that it was Meredith\u0027s arm. She was conscious, her mouth tight with fear, her hair streaming around her in the water.\\n\\n At first he couldn\u0027t see why she hadn\u0027t come to the surface. Then Meredith gestured emphatical y, reaching to fumble at long tendrils of pondweed that had somehow become entangled with her legs.\\n\\n Stefan swam down, pushing against the white water from the fal s, and tried to work his hand under the pondweed to pul it off her. It was wrapped so tightly around Meredith\u0027s legs that he couldn\u0027t get his fingers beneath it. Her skin was pressed white by the strands.\\n\\n Stefan struggled for a moment, then swam closer and let Power surge into him, sharpening and lengthening his canines. He bit, careful not to scratch Meredith\u0027s legs, and pul ed at the pondweed, but it resisted him. A little late, he realized that the resilience of the plants must be supernatural: His Power-enhanced strength was enough to break bones, tear through metal, and should have had no problem with a bit of pondweed.\\n\\n And final y - so slow, he reprimanded himself, always just so damn slow - he realized what he was looking at. Stefan felt his eyes widen in horror.\\n\\n The tight strands of pondweed against Meredith\u0027s long legs spel ed out a name. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-13.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) \\n The past is never far...
