{"id":111018,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"The day passed with much research, but with very little in the way of results, which left Elena feeling increasingly concerned for her comatose friend. By the time night fel and Aunt Judith cal ed to wearily inquire whether Elena\u0027s family would see her at al that day, they had sorted through the first bag of papers and Alaric had gone over a third or so of what seemed to be the notebook in which Caleb kept the record of his magical experiments, grumbling about Caleb\u0027s terrible handwriting.\\n\\n Elena frowned, flipping through another stack of papers. Looking through the pictures and clippings confirmed that Celia hadn\u0027t been among Caleb\u0027s planned victims. If the phantom had targeted her first, it must have been because she was rich in whatever emotion this phantom fed off.\\n\\n \"Snippiness,\" Meredith suggested, but she was careful to say it out of Alaric\u0027s hearing.\\n\\n The clippings and printouts also showed that Caleb was indeed obsessed with Tyler\u0027s disappearance, and that he had evidence and memories of two different time lines for the same period - one where Fel \u0027s Church had been fal ing apart and Elena Gilbert had been dead, and one where everything had been just fine, thanks in the smal Virginia town of Fel \u0027s Church, including the continuing reign of the senior class\u0027s golden girl, Elena. In addition to Caleb\u0027s own double memories, which covered only the summer, Tyler had apparently talked to him over the phone the previous fal and winter about the mysterious events surrounding Mr. Tanner\u0027s death and everything that fol owed. Although it didn\u0027t sound from Caleb\u0027s notes like Tyler had mentioned his own transformation to werewolf and conspiracy with Klaus, just his growing suspicions of Stefan.\\n\\n \"Tyler.\" Elena groaned. \"Even though he\u0027s long gone, he manages to make trouble.\"\\n\\n Alaric\u0027s examination of the notebook so far had proved that they were right that Caleb was a magic user, and that he was planning to use his magic both to take vengeance against them and to try to locate Tyler. But it hadn\u0027t shown how he had summoned the phantom.\\n\\n And despite Alaric\u0027s bringing any likely looking note, incantation, or drawing to Mrs. Flowers for inspection, they had not yet discovered what kind of spel Caleb had been doing, or what purpose the roses served.\\n\\n Stefan escorted Elena home for dinner, then returned to continue helping the others. He\u0027d wanted to stay with Elena, but she had a feeling her aunt would not appreciate a lastminute dinner guest. The second Elena stepped through the door, she could feel Damon\u0027s lingering presence and remembered how, just hours ago, they had stood upstairs, holding each other. Al through the meal, while she told Margaret a bedtime story, and then during her last cal to Meredith to check on the rest of the group\u0027s progress, she\u0027d thought longingly of him, wondering whether she would see him tonight. That in turn set off pangs of guilt related to Stefan and Bonnie. She was being so selfish, keeping Stefan\u0027s brother\u0027s return from him, and thinking of herself while Bonnie was in danger. The whole cycle was exhausting, but stil she couldn\u0027t contain her exuberance that Damon was alive. Alone in her room at last, Elena ran a brush through her silky golden hair and pul ed on the simple cool nightgown she\u0027d worn the night before. It was hot and humid outside, and through her window she could hear the crickets chirping busily. The stars were shining, and a half-moon floated high over the trees outside. She cal ed good night to Aunt Judith and Robert and climbed into bed, fluffing the pil ows around her.\\n\\n She half expected a long wait. Damon liked to tease, and he liked to make an entrance, so he was quite likely to wait until he thought she would be asleep, and then sweep into her room. But she had barely turned off the light when a piece of darkness seemed to separate itself from the night outside her window. There was the faintest scuff of a footstep on the floor, and then her mattress groaned as Damon settled himself at the foot of her bed.\\n\\n \"Hel o, love,\" he said softly.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" she said, smiling at him. His black eyes glittered at her from the shadows, and Elena suddenly felt warm and happy, despite everything.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the latest?\" he asked. \"I saw a lot of fuss going on at the boardinghouse. Something got your sidekicks in a tizzy?\" His tone was casual y sarcastic, but his gaze was intense, and Elena knew he had been worried.\\n\\n \"If you let me tel everyone you\u0027re alive, you could be with us and then you\u0027d know everything that\u0027s going on firsthand,\" she teased. Then she grew somber. \"Damon, we need your help. Something terrible has happened.\"\\n\\n She told him about Bonnie, and about what they had discovered in the Smal woods\u0027 garden shed.\\n\\n Damon\u0027s eyes flamed. \"A phantom\u0027s got the little redbird?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what Mrs. Flowers\u0027s mother said,\" Elena answered. \"Stefan told us that he\u0027d known of a rage phantom somewhere back in Italy.\"\\n\\n Damon made a little pfft! noise. \"I remember that. It was amusing at the time, but nothing like what you\u0027ve been describing. How does this theory of Stefan\u0027s explain Bonnie\u0027s being taken? Or the appearance of the names when someone is threatened?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Mrs. Flowers\u0027s theory, too,\" Elena said indignantly.\\n\\n \"Or her mother\u0027s, I guess. And it\u0027s the only one that makes sense.\" She could feel Damon stroking her arm with the most featherlight touch, and it felt good. The hairs prickled on the back of her arms, and she shivered with pleasure in spite of herself. Stop it, she thought sternly. This is serious business. She moved her arm out of Damon\u0027s reach. He sounded amused and lazy when he next spoke. \"Wel , I can\u0027t blame the old witch and her ghost mother,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Humans mostly stay in their own dimension; they learn only the tiniest piece of what\u0027s happening, even the most gifted of them. But if Stefan behaved like any self-respecting vampire and didn\u0027t go around trying to be human al the time, he\u0027d have a little more of a clue. He\u0027s barely even traveled to the Dark Dimension except when he was dragged there to sit in a cage or save Bonnie. Maybe if he had, he would understand what was going on and be able to protect his pet humans a little better.\"\\n\\n Elena bristled. \"Pet humans? I\u0027m one of those pet humans, too.\"\\n\\n Damon chuckled, and Elena realized he had said that purposely, to rile her up. \"A pet? You, princess? Never. A tiger, maybe. Something wild and dangerous.\"\\n\\n Elena rol ed her eyes. Then the implication of Damon\u0027s words hit her. \"Wait, are you saying this isn\u0027t a phantom?\\n\\n And that you know what it actual y is? Is it something that comes from the Dark Dimension?\"\\n\\n Damon shifted closer to her again. \"Would you like to know what I know?\" he said, his voice like a caress. \"There are a lot of things I could tel you.\"\\n\\n \"Damon,\" Elena said firmly. \"Stop flirting and pay attention. This is important. If you know anything, please tel me. If you don\u0027t, please don\u0027t play games with me. Bonnie\u0027s life is at stake. And we\u0027re al in danger. You\u0027re in danger, too, Damon: Don\u0027t forget, your name\u0027s been written, and we don\u0027t know for sure that whatever happened on the Dark Moon was the attack on you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not too concerned.\" Damon waved his hand disparagingly. \"It would take more than a phantom to hurt me, princess. But, yes, I know a little more about this than Stefan does.\" He turned her hand over and traced her palm with cool fingers. \"It is a phantom,\" he said. \"But it\u0027s not the same kind we saw in Italy long ago. Do you remember that Klaus was an Original? He wasn\u0027t sired like Katherine or Stefan or I was; he was never human. Vampires like Klaus consider vampires like us who started out as humans to be weak half-breeds. He was much stronger than us and much more difficult to kil . There are different types of phantoms, too. The phantoms who are born of human emotions on Earth are able to intensify and spur on these emotions. They don\u0027t have much consciousness of their own, though, and they never get very strong. They\u0027re just parasites. If they are cut off from the emotions they need to survive, they fade away pretty quickly.\"\\n\\n Elena frowned. \"But you think this is another, more powerful kind of phantom? Why? What did Sage tel you?\"\\n\\n Damon tapped her hand with one finger as he counted.\\n\\n \"One: the names. That\u0027s beyond the powers of an ordinary phantom. Two: It took Bonnie. A regular phantom wouldn\u0027t be able to do that, and wouldn\u0027t get anything out of it if it could. An Original phantom, though, can steal her spirit and take it back to the Dark Dimension. It can drain her life force and emotions to make itself stronger.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Elena said, alarmed. \"Bonnie\u0027s back in the Dark Dimension? Anything could be happening to her! She could be enslaved again!\" Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes as she thought of how humans were treated in the Dark Dimension.\\n\\n Damon squeezed her hand. \"No, don\u0027t worry about that. She\u0027s there only in spirit - the phantom wil have her in some kind of holding cel ; it\u0027l want her safe. I think the worst thing that could happen to her is she\u0027l be bored.\" He frowned. \"It\u0027l sap her life force, though, and that\u0027l weaken her eventual y.\"\\n\\n \"You think that being bored\u0027s the worst thing that could happen to her... oh, at least until it drains al her life force?\\n\\n That\u0027s not good enough, Damon. We have to help her.\"\\n\\n Elena thought for a moment. \"So phantoms live in the Dark Dimension?\"\\n\\n Damon hesitated. \"Not in the beginning. The Original phantoms were relegated to the Dark Moon by the Guardians.\"\\n\\n \"Where you died.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Damon said caustical y. Then he rubbed the back of her hand in a silent apology for his tone. \"Original phantoms are kept inside some kind of prison on the Dark Moon, just itching for a chance to get out. Like genies in a bottle. If something broke the prison wal , their ultimate goal would be to make it to Earth and feed on human emotions. After the World Tree was destroyed, Sage said things changed, which would make sense if an Original phantom managed to escape as things shifted after the destruction.\"\\n\\n \"Why come al the way to Earth, though?\" Elena asked.\\n\\n \"There\u0027re al those demons and vampires in the Dark Dimension.\"\\n\\n She could see Damon\u0027s smile in the shadows. \"I guess human emotion is extra-delicious. Like human blood is. And there aren\u0027t enough humans in the Dark Dimension to make a real y good meal. There are so many humans on Earth that an Original here can just keep on gorging on emotion and growing ever more powerful.\"\\n\\n \"So it fol owed us from the Dark Moon?\" Elena asked.\\n\\n \"It must have hitched a ride with you when you came back to Earth. It would have wanted to get as far from its prison as possible, so an opening between dimensions would have been irresistible.\"\\n\\n \"And it was freed from its prison when I used my Wings of Destruction and blasted the moon?\"\\n\\n Damon shrugged. \"That seems to be the most likely explanation.\"\\n\\n Elena\u0027s heart sank. \"So Bonnie\u0027s vision was right. I brought this. It\u0027s my fault.\"\\n\\n He brushed back her hair and kissed her neck. \"Don\u0027t think of it that way,\" he said. \"How could you have stopped it? You didn\u0027t know. And I\u0027m grateful you used the Wings of Destruction: That\u0027s what saved me, after al . The important thing now is to fight the phantom. We need to send it back before it gets too powerful. If it gets a real foothold here, it can start influencing more and more people. The whole world could be in danger.\"\\n\\n Elena half consciously arched her neck to one side so that Damon could get a better angle, and he gently traced the vein on the side of her neck with his lips for a moment before she realized what they were doing and nudged him away again. \"I don\u0027t understand, though. Why would it tel us who it\u0027s going after next?\" she said. \"Why does it give us the names?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s not its own doing,\" Damon said, and kissed her shoulder. \"Even the most powerful phantom has to fol ow the rules. It\u0027s part of the spel the Guardians put on the Original phantoms, when they relegated them to the Dark Moon. A safeguard in case the Originals ever escaped. This way, their prey knows they\u0027re coming, and it gives them a fair shot at resisting.\"\\n\\n \"The Guardians imprisoned it,\" Elena said. \"Would they help us send it back?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Damon said shortly. \"I wouldn\u0027t ask them if I could help it, though. I don\u0027t trust them, do you?\"\\n\\n Elena thought of the cool efficiency of the Guardians, of the way they had dismissed Damon\u0027s death as irrelevant. Of the way they had caused her own parents\u0027 death. \"No,\"\\n\\n she said, shivering. \"Let\u0027s leave them out of it if we can.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027l defeat it ourselves, Elena,\" Damon said, and caressed her cheek with his hand.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" Elena said. \"We have to concentrate.\"\\n\\n Damon stopped trying to touch her for a moment and thought. \"Tel me about your little friends. Have people been tense? Fighting? Acting out of character?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Elena said immediately. \"No one\u0027s been acting like themselves. I can\u0027t put my finger on it, but something\u0027s been wrong since we got back.\"\\n\\n Damon nodded. \"Since it probably came with you, it makes sense that it would have targeted you and those connected to you as its first victims.\"\\n\\n \"But how do we stop it?\" Elena asked. \"What do these stories you\u0027ve heard about the Original phantoms say about recapturing them once they\u0027ve escaped from their prison?\"\\n\\n Damon sighed, and his shoulders slumped a little.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know anything more. I\u0027l have to go back to the Dark Dimension and see what I can find out, or if I can fight the phantom from there.\"\\n\\n Elena stiffened. \"It\u0027s too dangerous, Damon.\"\\n\\n Damon chuckled, a dry sound in the darkness, and Elena felt his fingers run through her hair, smoothing the silky strands, then twisting them, tugging them gently. \"Not for me,\" he said. \"The Dark Dimension is a great place to be a vampire.\"\\n\\n \"Except that you died there,\" Elena reminded him.\\n\\n \"Damon, please. I can\u0027t stand to lose you again.\"\\n\\n Damon\u0027s hand stil ed, and then he was kissing her gently, and his other hand came up to touch her cheek. \"Elena,\" he said as he reluctantly broke the kiss. \"You won\u0027t lose me.\"\\n\\n \"There has to be another way,\" she insisted.\\n\\n \"Wel , then we\u0027d better find it, and soon,\" Damon answered grimly. \"Otherwise the entire world wil be at risk.\"\\n\\n Damon was saturated with Elena. Her sweet, rich scent in his nostrils, the throbbing beat of her heart in his ears, the silk of her hair and the satin of her skin against his fingers. He wanted to kiss her, to hold her, to sink his fangs into her and taste the heady nectar of her blood, that vibrant blood that tasted like no one else\u0027s.\\n\\n But she made him go, although he knew she didn\u0027t real y want to.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t say it was because of his little brother that she pushed him away, but he knew anyway. It was always Stefan.\\n\\n When he left her, he transformed graceful y into a large black crow again and flew from her bedroom window to the quince tree nearby. There, he folded his wings and shifted from one foot to another, settling in to watch over her. He could sense her through the window, anxious at first, her thoughts churning, but soon her pulse slowed, her breathing deepened, and he knew she was asleep. He would stay and guard her.\\n\\n There was no question: He had to save her. If Elena wanted a chivalrous knight, someone who would protect her nobly, Damon could do that. Why should that weakling Stefan have al the glory?\\n\\n But he wasn\u0027t sure what came next. Despite Elena\u0027s begging him not to go, heading into the Dark Dimension seemed like the logical next step in fighting this phantom. But how to get there? There were no easy paths. He didn\u0027t have the time to journey to one of the gates again, nor did he want to leave Elena\u0027s side long enough to travel there. And he couldn\u0027t expect to find something as useful as a star bal again by chance.\\n\\n Plus, if he did get there, being in the Dark Dimension would have special dangers for him now. He didn\u0027t think the Guardians knew he had come back from the dead, and he didn\u0027t know how they would react when they did. He\u0027d rather not find out. The Guardians didn\u0027t care for vampires much, and they tended to like things to stay the way they ought to be. Look at how they had stripped Elena\u0027s Powers when she came to their attention.\\n\\n Damon hunched his shoulders and fluffed out his iridescent feathers irritably. There had to be another way. There was the slightest rustle underfoot. No one without the sensitive ears of a vampire would have heard it, it was so cautious, but Damon caught it. He snapped to attention and peered sharply around. No one would get to his princess.\\n\\n Oh. Damon relaxed again and clicked his beak in vexation. Stefan. The shadowy figure of his little brother stood beneath the tree, head tilted back, gazing in devotion at Elena\u0027s darkened window. Of course he was there, standing by to defend her against al the horrors of the night.\\n\\n And just like that, Damon knew what he had to do: If he wanted to learn more about the phantom, he\u0027d have to give himself over to it.\\n\\n He closed his eyes, al owing every negative feeling he\u0027d ever had about Stefan to wash over him. How Stefan had always taken everything Damon wanted, had stolen it, if he needed to.\\n\\n Damn Stefan, Damon thought bitterly. If his brother hadn\u0027t come to town earlier than him, Damon would have had a chance to make Elena fal in love with him first, to be the one to reap the utter devotion he saw in her eyes when she looked at Stefan.\\n\\n Instead, here he was, second-best. He hadn\u0027t been enough for Katherine either; she had wanted his brother, too. Elena, tiger to the kitten Katherine had been, would have been the perfect mate for Damon. Beautiful, strong, wily, capable of great love, they could have ruled the night together.\\n\\n But she had fal en for his lily-livered weakling of a little brother. Damon\u0027s claws clenched the branch he sat on.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it sad,\" a quiet voice beside him suggested, \"how you try and try, but you\u0027re never enough for the women you love?\"\\n\\n A cool tendril of fog touched his wing. Damon straightened and looked around. Dark fog was winding around the quince tree, just at Damon\u0027s level. Below, Stefan stood unaware. The fog had come for Damon alone. With a private smile, Damon felt the fog envelop him, and then al was darkness.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-26.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) \\n The past is never far...
