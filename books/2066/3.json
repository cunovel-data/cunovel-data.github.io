{"id":110997,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The bright morning sun shone on the long, winding drive that led to the garage behind the boardinghouse. Puffs of white cloud scudded across the light blue sky. It was such a peaceful scene that it was almost impossible to believe that anything bad had ever happened in this place. The last time I was here, thought Stefan, putting on his sunglasses, it was a wasteland. When the kitsune had held sway in Fel \u0027s Church, it had been a war zone. Children against parents, teenage girls mutilating themselves, the town half-destroyed. Blood on the streets, pain and suffering everywhere. Behind him, the front door opened. Stefan turned quickly to see Mrs. Flowers coming out of the house. The old woman wore a long black dress, and her eyes were shielded by a straw hat covered with artificial flowers. She looked tired and worn, but her smile was as gentle as always. \"Stefan,\" she said. \"The world is here this morning, the way it should be.\" Mrs. Flowers stepped closer and gazed up into his face, her sharp blue eyes warm with sympathy. She looked as if she were about to ask him something, but at the last minute seemed to change her mind and instead said, \"Meredith cal ed, and Matt, too. It seems that, against al the odds, everyone has survived unscathed.\" She hesitated, and then squeezed his arm. \"Almost everyone.\" Something twisted painful y in Stefan\u0027s chest. He didn\u0027t want to talk about Damon. He couldn\u0027t, not yet. Instead, he bowed his head. \"We owe you a great debt, Mrs. Flowers,\" he said, choosing his words with care. \"We never could have defeated the kitsune without you - you were the one who held them at bay and defended the town for so long. None of us wil ever forget that.\" Mrs. Flowers\u0027s smile deepened, an unexpected dimple flickering in one cheek. \"Thank you, Stefan,\" she said with equal formality. \"There is no one I would have rather fought alongside than you and the others.\" She sighed and patted his shoulder. \"Although I must be getting old at last; I feel the need to spend most of today dozing in a chair in the garden. Fighting evil takes more out of me than it used to.\" Stefan offered his arm to assist her down the porch steps, and she smiled at him once more. \"Tel Elena that I\u0027l make those tea biscuits she likes whenever she\u0027s ready to leave her family and come visit,\" she said, then turned toward her rose garden. Elena and her family. Stefan imagined his love, her silky blond hair tumbling about her shoulders, little Margaret in her lap. Elena had another shot at a real human life now, which was worth everything. It had been Stefan\u0027s fault that Elena lost her first life - he knew that with a hard certainty that gnawed at his insides. He had brought Katherine to Fel \u0027s Church, and Katherine had destroyed Elena. This time he would make sure Elena was protected. With one last glance at Mrs. Flowers in her garden, he squared his shoulders and walked into the woods. Birds sang at the sun-dappled edges of the forest, but Stefan was headed much deeper in, where ancient oaks grew and the underbrush was thick. Where no one would see him, where he could hunt. Stopping in a smal clearing several miles in, Stefan took off his sunglasses and listened. From nearby came the soft crackle of something moving beneath a bush. He concentrated, reaching out with his mind. It was a rabbit, its heart beating rapidly, looking for its own morning meal. Stefan focused his mind on it. Come to me, he thought, gently and persuasively. He sensed the rabbit stiffen for a moment; then it hopped slowly out from under a bush, its eyes glassy. It came toward him docilely and, with an extra mental nudge from Stefan, stopped at his feet. Stefan scooped it up and turned it over to reach the tender throat, where its pulse fluttered. With a silent apology to the animal, Stefan gave himself over to his hunger, al owing his fangs to click into place. He tore into the rabbit\u0027s throat, drinking the blood slowly, trying not to wince at the taste. While the kitsune had threatened Fel \u0027s Church, Elena, Bonnie, Meredith, and Matt had insisted he feed on them, knowing human blood would keep him as strong as possible for the fight. Their blood had been almost otherworldly: Meredith\u0027s fiery and strong; Matt\u0027s pure and wholesome; Bonnie\u0027s sweet as dessert; Elena\u0027s heady and invigorating. Despite the foul taste of the rabbit in his mouth, his canines prickled with remembered hunger. But now he wouldn\u0027t drink human blood, he told himself firmly. He couldn\u0027t keep crossing that line, even if they were wil ing. Not unless his friends\u0027 safety was at risk. The change from human to animal blood would be painful; he remembered that from when he had first stopped drinking human blood - aching teeth, nausea, irritability, the feeling that he was starving even when his stomach was ful - but it was the only option. When the rabbit\u0027s heartbeat stopped altogether, Stefan gently disengaged. He held the limp body in his hands for a moment, then set it on the ground and covered it with leaves. Thank you, little one, he thought. He was stil hungry, but he had already taken one life this morning. Damon would have laughed. Stefan could almost hear him. Noble Stefan, he would scoff, his black eyes narrowing in half-affectionate disdain. You\u0027re missing all the best parts of being a vampire while you wrestle with your conscience, you fool. As if summoned by his thoughts, a crow cawed overhead. For a moment, Stefan ful y expected the bird to plummet to earth and transform into his brother. When it didn\u0027t, Stefan gave a short half laugh at his own stupidity and was surprised when it sounded almost like a sob. Damon was never coming back. His brother was gone. They\u0027d had centuries of bitterness between them and had only just started to repair their relationship, joining together to fight the evil that always seemed drawn to Fel \u0027s Church and to shield Elena from it. But Damon was dead, and now Stefan was the only one left to protect Elena and their friends. A latent worm of fear squirmed in his chest. There was so much that could go wrong. Humans were so vulnerable, and now that Elena had no special powers, she was as vulnerable as any of them. The thought sent him reeling, and immediately he took off, running straight toward Elena\u0027s house on the other side of the woods. Elena was his responsibility now. And he would never let anything hurt her again. The upstairs landing was almost the same as Elena remembered it: shining dark wood with an Oriental carpet runner, a few little tables with knickknacks and photographs, a couch near the big picture window overlooking the front drive. But halfway to the stairs, Elena paused, glimpsing something new. Among the silver-framed photos on one of the smal tables was a picture of herself and Meredith and Bonnie, faces close together, grinning widely in caps and gowns and proudly brandishing diplomas. Elena picked it up, holding it close. She had graduated from high school. It felt odd to see this other Elena, as she couldn\u0027t help thinking of her, her blond hair pul ed back in an elegant French twist, creamy skin flushed with excitement, smiling with her best friends, and not remember a thing about it. And she looked so carefree, this Elena, so ful of joy and hope and expectations for the future. This Elena knew nothing of the horror of the Dark Dimension or the havoc the kitsune had caused. This Elena was happy. Glancing quickly among the photos, Elena located a few more she hadn\u0027t seen before. Apparently this other Elena had been queen of the Snow Bal , though Elena remembered Caroline had won that crown after Elena\u0027s death. In this picture, however, Queen Elena was resplendent in pale violet silk, surrounded by her court: Bonnie fluffy and adorable in shiny blue taffeta; Meredith sophisticated in black; auburn-haired Caroline looking aggrieved in a tight silver dress that left very little to the imagination; and Sue Carson, pretty in pale pink, smiling straight into the camera, very much alive. Tears stung Elena\u0027s eyes once more. They had saved her. Elena and Meredith and Bonnie and Matt and Stefan had saved Sue Carson. Then Elena\u0027s gaze landed on another photograph, this one of Aunt Judith in a long, lacy wedding dress, Robert standing proudly beside her in a morning suit. With them was the other Elena, clearly the maid of honor, in a dress the color of green leaves, holding a bouquet of pink roses. Beside her stood Margaret, shining blond head ducked shyly, grasping Elena\u0027s dress with one hand. She was wearing a ful -skirted white flower girl\u0027s dress tied with a wide green sash, and she clutched a basket of roses in her other hand. Elena\u0027s hands shook a little as she put this picture down. It looked as if a good time had been had by al . What a pity she hadn\u0027t actual y been there. Downstairs, a glass clinked against the table, and she heard Aunt Judith laugh. Putting aside al the strangeness of this new past she\u0027d have to learn, Elena hurried down the stairs, ready to greet her future. In the dining room, Aunt Judith poured orange juice from a blue jug while Robert spooned batter onto the waffle iron. Margaret was kneeling behind her chair, narrating an intense conversation between her stuffed rabbit and a toy tiger. A great surge of joy fil ed Elena\u0027s chest, and she grabbed Aunt Judith in a tight hug and spun her around. Orange juice spil ed across the floor in a wide arc. \"Elena!\" scolded Aunt Judith, half laughing. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" \"Nothing! I just I love you, Aunt Judith,\" Elena said, hugging her tighter. \"I real y do.\" \"Oh,\" said Aunt Judith, her eyes soft. \"Oh, Elena, I love you, too.\" \"And what a beautiful day,\" Elena said, pirouetting away. \"A wonderful day to be alive.\" She dropped a kiss on Margaret\u0027s blond head. Aunt Judith reached for the paper towels. Robert cleared his throat. \"Are we to take it that you\u0027ve forgiven us for grounding you last weekend?\" Oh. Elena tried to figure out how to respond, but after she\u0027d been living on her own for months, the whole concept of being grounded by Aunt Judith and Robert seemed ridiculous. Stil , she widened her eyes and put on an appropriately contrite expression. \"I\u0027m truly sorry, Aunt Judith and Robert. It won\u0027t happen again.\" Whatever it is. Robert\u0027s shoulders relaxed. \"We\u0027l say no more about it, then,\" he said with obvious relief. He slid a hot waffle onto her plate and handed her the syrup. \"Do you have anything fun planned for today?\" \"Stefan is picking me up after breakfast,\" Elena said, then paused. The last time she had talked to Aunt Judith, after the disastrous Founder\u0027s Day pageant, Aunt Judith and Robert had been seriously anti-Stefan. They, like most of the town, had suspected him of being responsible for Mr. Tanner\u0027s death. But apparently they had no problem with Stefan in this world, because Robert simply nodded. And, she reminded herself, if the Guardians had done what she asked, Mr. Tanner was alive, so they couldn\u0027t have suspected Stefan of kil ing him... Oh, it was al so confusing! She went on: \"We\u0027re going to hang out in town, maybe catch up with Meredith and the others.\" She couldn\u0027t wait to see the town back to its old, safe self and to be with Stefan when, for once, they weren\u0027t battling some horrible evil but could just be a normal couple. Aunt Judith grinned. \"So, just another lazy day, hmm? I\u0027m glad you\u0027re having a nice summer before you go off to col ege, Elena. You worked so hard al last year.\" \"Mmm,\" said Elena vaguely, cutting into her waffle. She hoped the Guardians had gotten her into Dalcrest, a smal col ege a couple hours away, as she\u0027d requested. \"Come on up, Meggie,\" Robert said, buttering the little girl\u0027s waffle. Margaret scrambled up onto her chair, and Elena smiled at the obvious affection on Robert\u0027s face. Margaret was clearly his darling little girl. Catching Elena\u0027s eye, Margaret growled and thrust the toy tiger across the table toward her. Elena jumped. The little girl snarled, and her face was momentarily transformed into something savage. \"He wants to eat you with his big teeth,\" Margaret said, her little-girl voice hoarse. \"He\u0027s coming to get you.\" \"Margaret!\" Aunt Judith scolded as Elena shuddered. Margaret\u0027s briefly feral look reminded her of the kitsune, of the girls they had driven mad. But then Margaret gave her a huge grin and made the tiger nuzzle Elena\u0027s arm. The doorbel rang. Elena crammed the last bite of waffle into her mouth. \"That\u0027s Stefan,\" she mumbled around it. \"See you later.\" She wiped her lips and checked her hair in the mirror before opening the door. And there was Stefan, as handsome as ever. Elegant Roman features, high cheekbones, a classical straight nose, and sensual y curving mouth. He held his sunglasses loosely in one hand, and his leaf green eyes caught hers with a gaze of pure love. Elena broke into a wide, involuntary smile. Oh, Stefan, she thought to him, I love you, I love you. It\u0027s so wonderful to be home. I can\u0027t stop missing Damon and wishing we could have done something differently and saved him - and I wouldn\u0027t want to stop thinking of him - but I can\u0027t help being happy, too. Wait. She felt like someone had slammed on the brakes and she\u0027d been thrown against a seat belt. Though Elena was sending the words, and a huge wave of affection and love with them, toward Stefan, there was no response, no return of emotions. It was as if there were an invisible wal between her and Stefan, blocking her thoughts from reaching him. \"Elena?\" Stefan said aloud, his smile faltering. Oh. She hadn\u0027t realized. She hadn\u0027t even thought about this. When the Guardians took her powers, they must have taken everything. Including her telepathic connection to Stefan. It had lingered... She was sure she had stil heard him, and reached his mind, after she had lost her connection to Bonnie. But now it was gone completely. Leaning forward, she grasped his shirt, pul ed him to her, and kissed him fiercely. Oh, thank God, she thought, as she felt the familiar, comforting sense of their minds entwining. Stefan\u0027s lips curled into a smile beneath hers. I thought I\u0027d lost you, she thought, that I wouldn\u0027t be able to reach you like this anymore, either. Unlike with the telepathic connection they\u0027d shared, she knew the thoughts weren\u0027t reaching Stefan as words but as images and emotions. From him, she felt a wordless, steady stream of unfailing love. A throat was cleared pointedly behind them. Elena reluctantly released Stefan and turned to see Aunt Judith watching them. Stefan straightened with an embarrassed blush, the slightest look of apprehension in his eyes. Elena grinned. She loved that he\u0027d been through hel - literal y - but was stil scared to upset Elena\u0027s aunt. She put her hand on his arm, trying to send a message that Aunt Judith now accepted their relationship, but Aunt Judith\u0027s warm smile and greeting said it for her. \"Hel o, Stefan. You\u0027l be back by six, won\u0027t you, Elena?\" Aunt Judith asked. \"Robert\u0027s got a late meeting, so I thought you, Margaret, and I could go out for a girls\u0027 night together.\" She looked hopeful yet hesitant, like someone knocking on a door that might be slammed in her face. Elena\u0027s stomach knotted with guilt. Have I been avoiding Aunt Judith this summer? She could imagine that, if she hadn\u0027t died, she might have been eager to move on with her life and chafed at the family that wanted to keep her home and safe. But this Elena knew better - knew how lucky she was to have Aunt Judith and Robert. And it seemed that this Elena had a lot of making up to do. \"Sounds like fun!\" she said cheerful y, pasting a bright smile on her face. \"Can I invite Bonnie and Meredith? They\u0027d love a girls\u0027 night.\" And it would be nice, she thought, to have friends around who were as clueless about what had been going on in this version of Fel \u0027s Church as she was. \"Wonderful,\" Aunt Judith said, looking happier and more relaxed. \"Have a good time, kids.\" As Elena headed out the door, Margaret ran out of the kitchen. \"Elena!\" she said, wrapping her arms tightly around Elena\u0027s waist. Elena bent and kissed the top of her head. \"I\u0027l catch you later, bunny rabbit,\" she said. Margaret motioned for Elena and Stefan to kneel down, then put her lips right next to their ears. \"Don\u0027t forget to come back this time,\" she whispered before retreating inside. For a moment, Elena just knelt there, frozen. Stefan squeezed her hand, pul ing her up, and even without their telepathic connection, she knew they were having the same thought. As they headed away from the house, Stefan took her by the shoulders. His green eyes gazed into hers, and he bent forward to brush a light kiss upon her lips. \"Margaret\u0027s a little girl,\" he said firmly. \"It could just be that she doesn\u0027t want her big sister to leave. Maybe she\u0027s worried about you going off to col ege.\" \"Maybe,\" Elena murmured as Stefan wrapped his arms around her. She inhaled his green, woodsy scent and felt her breathing slow and the knot in her stomach loosen. \"And if not,\" she said slowly, \"we\u0027l work it out. We always do. But right now I want to see what the Guardians gave us.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-3.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) The past is never far...
