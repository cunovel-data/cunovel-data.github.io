She gave him a reproving glance and he stared back at her in exasperation. \"If he\u0027s unconscious,\" he explained, \"it\u0027l give us more of a chance to figure out what spel he\u0027s cast on us.\"\n They\u0027d fil ed three fat black trash bags with the papers, clippings, and books they\u0027d found in the Smal woods\u0027\n garden shed. Elena had been afraid to disturb the pentagram with the roses and photographs around it on the shed floor, in case that would affect the spel somehow, but she\u0027d taken a couple of pictures of it with her cel phone. Matt came out and picked up one of the bags. \"Bringing over some garbage?\"\n \"Something like that,\" Elena said grimly, and fil ed him in on what they\u0027d discovered at the Smal wood house. Matt grimaced. \"Wow. But maybe now we can final y do something about what\u0027s been happening.\"\n \"How come you\u0027re here so early?\" Elena asked, fol owing him toward the house. \"I thought you weren\u0027t coming onto guard duty until ten.\" Stefan trailed along behind her.\n \"I spent the night,\" Matt told her. \"After Bonnie\u0027s name appeared, I didn\u0027t want to let her out of my sight.\"\n \"Bonnie\u0027s name appeared?\" Elena whirled accusingly on Stefan. \"Why didn\u0027t you tel me?\"\n Stefan shrugged uncomfortably. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" he confessed hesitantly.\n \"Stefan, I told you to protect Meredith and Celia,\" she snapped. \"You were supposed to be here. Even before Bonnie\u0027s name showed up, it was Meredith and Celia who were in danger. I was relying on you to watch over them.\"\n Stefan glared back at her. \"I\u0027m not your lapdog, Elena,\" he said quietly. \"I saw a mysterious threat that I thought bore investigation. I acted to protect you. And I was right. The danger was more immediate to you than the others. And now we have a chance to piece together the spel .\"\n Elena blinked at his tone but couldn\u0027t deny the truth in his words. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said contritely. \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m glad we discovered Caleb\u0027s shed.\"\n Matt opened the front door. They dumped the bags in the hal and went through to the kitchen, where Mrs. Flowers, Alaric, and Meredith were enjoying a breakfast of croissants, jam, fruit, and sausages.\n \"Celia\u0027s gone,\" Meredith said to Elena as soon as they entered the room. Her tone was casual y informative, but her usual y cool gray eyes were twinkling, and Elena shared a secret smile with her friend.\n \"Where\u0027d she go?\" Elena asked, equal y casual y, reaching for a croissant. It had been a long morning, and she was starving.\n \"University of Virginia,\" Alaric answered. \"She\u0027s hoping to get some leads by doing research on curses and folk magic.\"\n \"We might have some more information now,\" Elena announced around a mouthful of deliciously buttery croissant. She explained what they had found in the shed.\n \"We brought al the papers and Caleb\u0027s notebooks with us. And here\u0027s what he\u0027d laid out on the floor.\" She pul ed out her phone, loaded the picture, and handed it to Mrs. Flowers.\n \"My goodness,\" said the old woman. \"This certainly looks like dark magic. I wonder what that child thought he was doing.\"\n Stefan snorted. \"He\u0027s no child, Mrs. Flowers. I strongly suspect he\u0027s a werewolf as wel as a dark magician.\"\n Mrs. Flowers looked at him sternly. \"He\u0027s found the wrong way of going about looking for his cousin, that\u0027s for certain. But this magic looks rather amateurish to me. If it has worked, it wil have been more by accident than design.\"\n \"If it\u0027s worked?\" Meredith asked. \"I think the evidence suggests that whatever he\u0027s done worked.\"\n \"Surely it would be too much of a coincidence for Caleb to be trying to cast spel s on us and for an unexplained curse to be affecting us as wel ,\" Alaric noted.\n \"Where\u0027s Caleb now?\" Matt asked, frowning. \"Does he know you found al this? Do we need to track him down and keep an eye on him?\"\n Stefan crossed his arms. \"He\u0027s in the hospital.\"\n There was a little pause as the others looked at one another and decided, based on Stefan\u0027s stony demeanor, not to delve deeper. Meredith glanced questioningly at Elena, and Elena nodded slightly to say, I\u0027ll explain later. She turned to Mrs. Flowers. \"Can you tel what spel Caleb was using? What was he trying to do?\"\n Mrs. Flowers stared thoughtful y at the picture. \"It\u0027s an interesting question,\" she said. \"Roses are typical y used in love spel s, but the pentagram and multiple pictures around it suggest a darker intent here. The roses\u0027 unusual crimson color would probably make them more effective. They might be used to evoke other passions as wel . My best guess would be that Caleb was trying to control your emotions in some way.\"\n Elena cast a sudden glance at Stefan, taking in his guarded expression and tense shoulders.\n \"But that\u0027s as much as I can tel you for now,\" Mrs. Flowers continued. \"If the rest of you want to look through Caleb\u0027s notebooks for clues, Bonnie and I can research the magical properties of roses and what spel s they could be used in.\"\n \"Where is Bonnie?\" Elena asked. Although she\u0027d had the sense that something was missing, she\u0027d only just consciously realized that the petite redhead wasn\u0027t among the group in the kitchen.\n \"Stil sleeping,\" Meredith said. \"You know how she loves to sleep in.\" She grinned. \"Bonnie was definitely enjoying being the damsel in peril and having everybody fussing over her last night.\"\n \"I thought she was being real y brave,\" Matt said unexpectedly. Elena eyed him. Was he beginning to feel something romantic for Bonnie? They\u0027d be good together, she thought, and was surprised to feel a tiny twinge of possessive anger mixed in with her speculative matchmaking. Matt has always been yours, after all, a hard voice whispered to her.\n \"I\u0027l go up and wake her,\" Meredith said cheerful y. \"No rest for the witches.\" She swung to her feet and headed for the stairs, limping only slightly.\n \"How\u0027s your ankle?\" Elena asked. \"You look a lot better.\"\n \"I heal fast,\" Meredith said. \"I guess it\u0027s part of the vampire-hunter thing. I didn\u0027t need the cane by the time I went to bed last night, and this morning it feels almost back to normal.\"\n \"Lucky you,\" said Elena.\n \"Lucky me,\" Meredith agreed, grinning at Alaric, who smiled back admiringly. Showing off, she ran lightly up the stairs, leaning only a little on the banister for support. Elena took another croissant and spread jam on it. \"The rest of us should start going through al the papers and things we took from Caleb\u0027s shed. Alaric, as you\u0027re the only one other than Mrs. Flowers and Bonnie who knows much about magic, you can take his notebooks and I\u0027l - \"\n She broke off as a scream came from overhead.\n \"Meredith!\" shouted Alaric.\n Later, Elena didn\u0027t real y remember getting upstairs. There was just a flash of shoving limbs and pandemonium as everyone tried to get up the narrow staircase as quickly as possible. At the door of the little cream-and-rose bedroom at the end of the hal , Meredith stood, white-faced and stricken. She turned large panicked gray eyes toward them and whispered, \"Bonnie.\"\n Inside, Bonnie\u0027s smal figure lay motionless facedown on the floor, one pajamaed arm flung out toward the door. Unlit black and white candles were in a ring behind her, one black candle knocked over. There was a smudge of what looked like mostly dried blood inside the candle ring, and a weathered book lay open beside it.\n Elena pushed past Meredith and knelt beside the stil figure, feeling at her neck for a pulse. She let out the breath she\u0027d been holding as she felt Bonnie\u0027s heartbeat, steady and strong, beneath her fingers.\n \"Bonnie,\" she said, shaking her by the shoulder, then gently rol ing her over. Bonnie flopped without resistance onto her back. She was breathing regularly, but her eyes stayed closed, her long lashes dark against her freckled cheeks.\n \"Somebody cal an ambulance,\" Elena said quickly.\n \"I\u0027l do it,\" Meredith said, breaking out of her frozen stance.\n \"We don\u0027t need an ambulance,\" Mrs. Flowers said quietly, gazing down at Bonnie with an expression of sorrow on her face.\n \"What are you talking about?\" Meredith snapped. \"She\u0027s unconscious! We have to get her help.\"\n Mrs. Flowers\u0027s eyes were grave. \"The doctors and nurses at the hospital won\u0027t be able to help Bonnie,\" she said. \"They might even hurt her by interfering with ineffective medical solutions to a nonmedical problem. Bonnie\u0027s not sick; she\u0027s under a spel . I can feel the magic thick in the air. The best thing we can do is to make her as comfortable as we can here while we look for a cure.\"\n Matt stepped forward into the room. His face was aghast, but he wasn\u0027t looking at Bonnie\u0027s motionless form on the floor. He raised one hand and pointed. \"Look,\" he said.\n Near the bed, a tray containing a smal teapot, a cup, and a plate had been knocked over onto the floor. The cup had smashed and the teapot lay on its side, tea leaves spil ing out in a long, dark curve across the floor.\n A curve that spel ed out a name. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-24.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) \n The past is never far...
