{"id":111021,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Stefan drove like a maniac al the way back to the boardinghouse. \"I can\u0027t believe I forgot to tel him that his name had been cal ed,\" he said for what felt like the hundredth time. \"I can\u0027t believe we left him alone.\" \"Slow down,\" Meredith told him, trying to hold Matt\u0027s sleeping body steady in the backseat as Stefan whipped around a corner, tires squealing. \"You\u0027re going way too fast.\" \"We\u0027re in a hurry,\" Stefan growled, yanking on the wheel to make a hard right. Alaric turned around in the passenger seat and gave Meredith a panicky look as Stefan narrowly missed a garbage truck. She sighed. She knew he was trying to make up for his mistake, for not tel ing them immediately that Matt\u0027s name had appeared in the herb shop, but kil ing them al in a race to get home wasn\u0027t exactly the solution. Besides, although they probably would have done things differently if they\u0027d known, it might not have changed the outcome for Matt. It wasn\u0027t as if their precautions had saved either Bonnie or Elena. \"At least you\u0027ve got vampire reflexes,\" she said, more to reassure Alaric than out of any particular confidence in Stefan\u0027s driving abilities. She\u0027d insisted on being the one sitting in the back with Matt, and now she turned her attention to him. She put a restraining hand on his chest so he wouldn\u0027t go tumbling to the floor as the car jerked and swerved. He was so stil . None of the twitching and eye movements that usual y went with sleep, just the steady shal ow rise and fal of his breathing. He wasn\u0027t even snoring. And she knew from camping trips as far back as sixth grade that Matt snored like a buzz saw. Always. Meredith never cried. Not even when the worst happened. And she wasn\u0027t going to start now, not when her friends needed her calm and focused to try to figure out how to save them. But if she had been the kind of girl who cried, instead of the kind of girl who strategized, she would have been sobbing. And even now, the breath caught in her throat a little painful y, until she schooled herself into impassive calm again. She was the only one left. Of the four old friends who\u0027d gone through school and summers and adolescence and al the horrors the supernatural world could throw at them, she was the only one the phantom hadn\u0027t captured. Yet. Meredith clenched her teeth and held Matt steady. Stefan pul ed up and parked in front of the boardinghouse, having somehow avoided causing any damage to other cars or pedestrians along the way. Alaric and Meredith started to inch Matt careful y out of the car, looping his arms around their necks and slowly shifting him forward into a half-standing position. But Stefan simply grabbed Matt away from them and threw him over his shoulder. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said, and stalked off toward the boardinghouse, easily balancing Matt\u0027s unconscious body with one hand, not looking back. \"He\u0027s become kind of a strange guy,\" Alaric commented, watching Stefan alertly. The sunshine caught the stubble on Alaric\u0027s unshaven chin and it glinted with a touch of gold. He turned toward Meredith and gave her a rueful, disarming grin. \"Once more into the breach...\" he said. Meredith took his hand, warm and solid in her own. \"Come on,\" she said. Once they were in the boardinghouse, Stefan clomped straight upstairs to deposit Matt with the other bodies - the other sleepers, Meredith reminded herself fiercely. Meredith and Alaric, hand in hand, turned toward the kitchen. As she pushed the door open, Meredith heard Mrs. Flowers\u0027s voice. \"Very useful indeed, my dear,\" she was saying, a warm note of approval in her voice. \"You\u0027ve done very wel . I\u0027m so grateful.\" Meredith gaped. At the kitchen table with Mrs. Flowers, cool and calm and pretty in a blue linen dress, sat Dr. Celia Conner, sipping tea. \"Hel o, Alaric. Hel o, Meredith,\" said Celia. Her dark eyes bored cool y into Meredith\u0027s. \"You\u0027l never believe what I\u0027ve found.\" \"What?\" said Alaric eagerly, letting go of Meredith\u0027s hand. Her heart sank. Celia reached into a tote bag sitting by her chair and pul ed out a thick book bound in ragged brown leather. She smiled triumphantly and announced, \"It\u0027s a book on phantoms. Dr. Beltram ended up sending me to Dalcrest Col ege, which actual y has a very comprehensive col ection of texts on the paranormal.\" \"I suggest we adjourn to the den,\" Mrs. Flowers said, \"where we can be more comfortable, and examine its contents together.\" They moved to the den, but Stefan, when he joined them, did not seem any more comfortable. \"Different types of phantoms,\" he said, taking the book from Celia and flipping rapidly through the pages. \"The history of phantoms in our dimension. Where is the banishment ritual? Why doesn\u0027t this thing have an index?\" Celia shrugged. \"It\u0027s very old and rare,\" she said. \"It was difficult to find, and it\u0027s the only book on the subject we\u0027re likely to be able to get our hands on, maybe the only one that exists, so we\u0027l have to excuse things like that. These older texts, the authors wanted you to read straight through and real y learn about their subject, to understand what they wanted to tel you, not just to find the page you needed right away. You might try looking near the end, though.\" Alaric was watching Stefan whip through the pages with an expression of pain. \"It\u0027s a rare book, Stefan,\" he said. \"Please be more careful with it. Would you like me to look? I\u0027m used to finding what I need in these kinds of books.\" Stefan snarled, literal y snarled at him, and Meredith felt the hairs along the back of her neck rise. \"I\u0027l do it myself, teacher. I\u0027m in a hurry.\" He squinted down at the text. \"Why does it have to be in such ornate print?\" he complained. \"Don\u0027t tel me it\u0027s because it\u0027s old. I\u0027m older than it is, and I can barely read it. Huh. \u0027Phantoms who are feeding like vampires on one choice sensibility, whether it be guilt, or despair, or grudge; or lust for victuals, the demon rum, or fal en women. The stronger be the sensibility, the worse be the outcome of the phantom created.\u0027 I think we could have figured that out ourselves.\" Mrs. Flowers was standing slightly removed from the rest of the group, eyes fixed on empty air, muttering seemingly to herself as she communed with her mother. \"I know,\" she said. \"I\u0027l tel them.\" Her eyes focused on the others as they stood around Stefan, peering over his shoulders. \"Mama says that time is getting short,\" she warned. Stefan leaped to his feet and exploded. \"I know it\u0027s getting short,\" he roared, getting right up into Mrs. Flowers\u0027s surprised face. \"Can\u0027t your mother tel us something useful for once?\" Mrs. Flowers staggered away from him, reaching out to steady herself on the back of a chair. Her face was white, and suddenly she looked older and more frail than ever before. Stefan\u0027s eyes widened, their color darkening to a stormy sea green, and he held out his hands, his face horrified. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"Mrs. Flowers, I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to frighten you. I don\u0027t know what came over me... I\u0027m just so worried about Elena and the others.\" \"I know, Stefan,\" Mrs. Flowers said gravely. She had regained her balance and she looked stronger, calm and wise again. \"We will get them back, you know. You must have faith. Mama does.\" Stefan sat down, turning back to the book, his lips pressed together into a straight line. Her skin prickling with apprehension, Meredith gripped her stave more tightly as she watched him. When she had revealed to the others that the members of her family were hereditary vampire hunters and that it was now her turn to take on the duty, she had told Elena and Stefan that she would never turn on Stefan, that she understood that he wasn\u0027t like other, evil vampires, that he was good: harmless and benign to humans. She had made no such promises about Damon, and Elena and Stefan hadn\u0027t asked her to. They al shared an unspoken understanding that Damon couldn\u0027t real y be characterized as harmless, not even when he begrudgingly worked with them, and that Meredith would need to keep her options open when it came to him. But Stefan... she had never thought this would happen, but now Meredith was worried that someday she might not be able to keep her promises about Stefan. She had never seen him acting the way he had been lately: irrational, angry, violent, unpredictable. She knew his behavior was probably caused by the phantom, but was Stefan becoming too dangerous? Could she kil him if she had to? He was her friend. Meredith\u0027s heart was racing. She realized that her knuckles had whitened against her fighting stave, and her hand ached. Yes, she realized, she would fight Stefan and try to kil him, if she had to. It was true that he was her friend, but her duty had to come first. She took a deep breath and consciously relaxed her hands. Stay calm, she coached herself. Breathe. Stefan was keeping himself more or less under control. It wasn\u0027t a decision she had to make. Not yet, anyway. A few minutes later, Stefan stopped flipping pages. \"Here,\" he said. \"I think this is it.\" He handed the book to Mrs. Flowers. She scanned the page quickly and nodded. \"That feels like the right ritual,\" she said seriously. \"I ought to have everything we need to perform it right here in the house.\" Alaric reached for the book. He read the spel , too, frowning. \"Does it have to be a blood spel ?\" he asked Mrs. Flowers. \"If it backfires, the phantom might be able to turn it against us.\" \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s going to have to be a blood spel ,\" Mrs. Flowers replied. \"We\u0027d need more time to experiment to change the spel , and time is the one thing we don\u0027t have. If the phantom is able to use its captives the way we think it can, it\u0027s only going to get more powerful.\" Alaric began to speak again but was interrupted. \"Wait,\" said Celia, a slightly shril note in her usual y husky voice. \"A blood spel ? What does that mean? I don\u0027t want to get involved in anything\" - she searched for a word - \"unsavory.\" She reached for the book, but Stefan slammed his hand down on it. \"Unsavory or not, this is what we\u0027re doing,\" he said quietly, but with a voice as hard as steel. \"And you\u0027re a part of it. It\u0027s too late for you to back out now. I won\u0027t let you.\" Celia gave a convulsive shudder and cringed back in her chair. \"Don\u0027t you dare threaten me,\" she said, her voice quavering. \"Everybody calm down,\" Meredith said sharply. \"Celia, no one is going to make you do anything unless you agree to it. I\u0027l protect you myself if need be.\" Her eyes flew quickly to Alaric, who was glancing back and forth between them, looking worried. \"But we need your help. Please. You may have saved us al by finding the spel , and we\u0027re grateful, but Stefan\u0027s right - you\u0027re part of this, too. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027l work without you.\" She hesitated a beat. \"Or, if it does, it might leave you as the phantom\u0027s only target,\" she added cunningly. Celia shivered again and wrapped her arms around herself. \"I\u0027m not a coward,\" she said miserably. \"I\u0027m a scientist, and this... irrational mysticism worries me. But I\u0027m in. I\u0027l help any way I can.\" Meredith, for the first time, felt a flash of sympathy for her. She understood how hard it must be for Celia to continue to think of herself as a logical person while the boundaries of what she\u0027d always accepted as reality col apsed around her. \"Thank you, Celia.\" Meredith glanced around the room at the others. \"We\u0027ve got the ritual. We\u0027ve got the ingredients. We just need to gather everything together and start casting the spel . Are we ready?\" Everyone sat up straighter, their faces taking on expressions of stern resolve. As scary as this was, it was good to final y have a purpose and a plan. Stefan breathed deeply and visibly took hold of himself, his shoulders relaxing and his stance settling into something less predatory. \"Okay, Meredith,\" he said. His stormy green eyes met her cool gray ones, in perfect accord. \"Let\u0027s do this.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-phantom-the-vampire-diaries-1/page-30.html","bookId":2066,"book":{"id":2066,"title":"The Hunters: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries #1)","description":"Storyline: Phantom (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters, #1) The past is never far...
