Ten years, eh? Where did he live?“ ”About two hundred miles away,\" said Eric earnestly.\\n\\n “Kept getting lost, did he?” “And when he got home he fought his wife\u0027s suitors and everything, and his dear dog recognised him and died.”\\n\\n “Oh, dear.” “It was the carrying his slippers in its mouth for fifteen years that killed it off.” “Shame.” \"And you know what, demon? All this hasn\u0027t happened yet. We could save him all that\\n\\n trouble!\"\\n\\n Rincewind thought about this. “We could tell him to get a better navigator, for a start,” he said. There was a creak. The soldiers had got the door open. “Everyone fall in, or whatever the bloody stupid command is,” said Lavaeolus. \"The\\n\\n magic box to the front, please. No killing anyone unless it\u0027s really necessary. Try not to damage things. Right. Forward.\"\\n\\n The door led into a column-lined corridor. There was the distant murmur of voices.\\n\\n The troop crept towards the sound until it reached a heavy curtain. Lavaeolus took a\\n\\n deep breath, pushed it aside and stepped forward and launched into a prepared speech. “Now, I want to make myself absolutely clear,” he said. “I don\u0027t want there to be any unpleasantness of any kind, or any shouting for guards and so forth. Or indeed any shouting at all. We will just take the young lady and go home, which is where anyone of any sense ought to be. Otherwise I shall really have to put everyone to the sword, and I hate having to do things like that.”\\n\\n The audience to this statement did not appear to be impressed. This was because it was a\\n\\n small child on a potty. Lavaeolus changed mental gear and went on smoothly: “On the other hand, if you don\u0027t tell me where everyone is, I shall ask the sergeant here to give you a really hard smack.”\\n\\n The child took its thumb out of its mouth. “Mummy is seeing to Cassie,” it said. “Are you Mr. Beekle?”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t think so,” said Lavaeolus. “Mr. Beekle is a silly.” The child withdrew its thumb and, with the air of one concluding some exhaustive research, added: “Mr. Beekle is a poo.”\\n\\n “Sergeant?” “Sir?” “Guard this child.” “Yessir. Corporal?” “Sarge?” “Take care of the kid.” “Yes, sarge. Private Archeios?”\\n\\n “Yes, corp,” said the soldier, his voice gloomy with prescience.\\n\\n “See to the sprog.”\\n\\n Private Archeios looked around. There was only Rincewind and Eric left and, while it was true that a civilian was in every respect the lowest possible rank there was, coming somewhere after the regimental donkey, the expressions on their faces suggested that they weren\u0027t about to take any orders.\\n\\n Lavaeolus wandered across the room and listened at another curtain.\\n\\n “We could tell him all kinds of stuff about his future,” hissed Eric. “He had - I mean, he will have - all kinds of things happen to him. Shipwrecks and magic and all his crew turned into animals and stuff like that.”\\n\\n “Yes. We could say `Walk home`,” said Rincewind.\\n\\n The curtain swished aside.\\n\\n There was a woman there - plump, good-looking in a slightly faded way, wearing a black dress and the beginnings of a moustache. A number of children of varying sizes were trying to hide behind her. Rincewind counted at least seven of them.\\n\\n “Who\u0027s that?” said Eric.\\n\\n “Ahem,” said Rincewind. “I rather think it\u0027s Elenor of Tsort.”\\n\\n “Don\u0027t be silly,” whispered Eric. “She looks like a mum. Elenor was much younger and was all -” His voice gave out and he made several wavy motions with his hand, indicative of the shape of a woman who would probably be unable to keep her balance.\\n\\n Rincewind tried not to catch the sergeant\u0027s eye.\\n\\n “Yes,” he said, going a bit red. “Well, you see. Er. You\u0027re absolutely right, but well, it\u0027s been a long siege, hasn\u0027t it, what with one thing and another.”\\n\\n “I don\u0027t see what that\u0027s got to do with it,” said Eric sternly. “The Classics never said anything about children. They said she spent all her time mooning around the towers of Tsort and pining for her lost love.”\\n\\n “Well, yes, I expect she did pine a bit,” said Rincewind. \"Only, you know, you can only\\n\\n pine so much, and it must have been a bit chilly up on those towers.“ ”You can catch your death, mooning,“ nodded the sergeant. Lavaeolus watched the woman thoughtfully. Then he bowed. ”I expect you know why we\u0027re here, my lady?“ he said. ”If you touch any of the children I shall scream,\" said Elenor flatly. Once again Lavaeolus showed that along with his guerilla abilities was a marked\\n\\n reluctance to waste a prepared speech once he had it all sorted out in his head. “Fair maiden,” he began. \"We have faced many dangers in order to rescue you and take\\n\\n you back to your loved...“ His voice faltered. ”...ones. Er. This has all gone terribly wrong, hasn\u0027t it?“ ”I can\u0027t help it,“ said Elenor. ”The siege seemed to go on for such a long time and King\\n\\n Mausoleum was very kind and I never liked it much in Ephebe anyway -“ ”Where is everyone now? The Tsorteans, I mean. Apart from you.“ ”They\u0027re all out on the battlements throwing rocks, if you must know.“ Lavaeolus flung up his hands in desperation. ”Couldn\u0027t you, you know, have slipped us a note or something? Or invited us to one of\\n\\n the christenings?“ ”You all seemed to be enjoying yourselves so much,“ she said. Lavaeolus turned and shrugged gloomily. ”All right,“ he said. ”Fine. QED. No problem.\\n\\n I wanted to leave home and spend ten years sitting in a swamp with a bunch of meat-headed morons. It wasn\u0027t as if I had anything important to do back home, just a little kingdom to rule, that sort of thing. O-kay. Well, then. We might as well be off. I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know how I shall break it to everyone,“ he said bitterly, ”they were having such fun. They\u0027ll probably have a bloody great banquet and laugh about it and get drunk, it\u0027d be their style.\"\\n\\n He looked at Rincewind and Eric.\\n\\n “You might as well tell me what happens next,” he said. “I\u0027m sure you know.”\\n\\n “Um,” said Rincewind.\\n\\n “The city burns down,” said Eric. “Especially the topless towers. I didn\u0027t get to see them,” he added sulkily. “Who did it? Their lot or our lot?” said Lavaeolus. “Your lot, I think,” said Eric. Lavaeolus sighed. “Sounds like them,” he said. He turned to Elenor. \"Our lot - that is,\\n\\n my lot - are going to burn down the city,“ he said. ”It sounds very heroic. It\u0027s just the kind of thing they go for. It might be a good idea to come with us. Bring the kids. Make it a day out for all the family, why don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Eric pulled Rincewind\u0027s ear towards his mouth.\\n\\n “This is a joke, isn\u0027t it?” he said. “She\u0027s not really the fair Elenor, you\u0027re just having me on?” “It\u0027s always the same with these hot-blooded types,” said Rincewind. \"They definitely go\\n\\n downhill at thirty-five.“ ”It\u0027s the pasta that does it,“ said the sergeant. ”But I read where she was the most beautiful -“ ”Ah, well,“ said the sergeant. ”If you\u0027re going to go around reading -“ ”The thing is,“ said Rincewind quickly, ”it\u0027s what they call dramatic necessity. No-one\u0027s\\n\\n going to be interested in a war fought over a, a quite pleasant lady, moderately attractive in a good light. Are they?“ Eric was nearly in tears. ”But it said her face launched a thousand ships - \"\\n\\n “That\u0027s what you call a metaphor,” said Rincewind.\\n\\n “Lying,” the sergeant explained, kindly.\\n\\n “Anyway, you shouldn\u0027t believe everything you read in the classics,” Rincewind added. “They never check their facts. They\u0027re just out to sell legends.”\\n\\n Lavaeolus, meanwhile, was deep in argument with Elenor. “All right, all right,” he said. “Stay here if you like. Why should I care? Come on, you lot. We\u0027re going. What are you doing, Private Archeios?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m being a horse, sir,” explained the soldier. “He\u0027s Mr. poo,” said the child, who was wearing Private Archaios\u0027 helmet. \"Well, when you\u0027ve finished being a horse, find us an oil lamp. I caught my knees a right\\n\\n wallop in that tunnel.\"\\n\\n Flames roared over Tsort. The entire hubward sky was red. Rincewind and Eric watched from a rock down by the beach. “They\u0027re not topless towers, anyway,” said Eric after a while. “I can see the tops.” “I think they meant the toppleless towers,” Rincewind hazarded, as another one\\n\\n collapsed, red-hot, into the ruins of the city. “And that was wrong, too.”\\n\\n They watched in silence for a while longer, and the Eric said, “Funny, that. The way you tripped over the Luggage and dropped the lamp and everything.” “Yes,” said Rincewind shortly. “Makes you think history is always going to find a way to work itself out.” “Yes.” “Good, though, the way your luggage rescued everyone.”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “Funny to see all those kids riding on its back.”\\n\\n “Yes.” “Everyone seems quite pleased about it.” The opposing armies were, at any rate. No-one was bothered to ask the civilians, whose\\n\\n views on warfare were never reliable. Among the soldiery, at least among the soldiery of a certain rank, there was a lot of back-slapping and telling of anecdotes, jovial exchanging of shields and a general consensus that, what with the fires and sieges and armadas and wooden horses and everything, it had been a jolly good war. The sound of singing echoed across the wine-dark sea.\\n\\n “Hark at them,” said Lavaeolus, emerging from the gloom around the beached Ephebian ships. “It\u0027ll be fifteen choruses of \u0027The Ball of Philodelphus\u0027 next, you mark my words. Lot of idiots with their brains in their jockstraps.”\\n\\n He sat down on the rock. “Bastards,” he said, with feeling. “Do you think Elenor will be able to explain it all to her boyfriend?” said Eric. “I imagine so,” said Lavaeolus. “They usually can.” “She did get married. And she\u0027s got lots of children,” said Eric. Lavaeolus shrugged. “A moment\u0027s wild passion,” he said. He gave Rincewind a sharp\\n\\n look. “Hey, you, demon,” he said. “I\u0027d like a quiet word, if I may.” He led Rincewind towards the boats, pacing heavily across the damp sand as if there was\\n\\n a lot on weighing on his mind.\\n\\n “I\u0027m going home tonight, on the tide,” he said. “No sense in hanging about here, what with the war being over and everything.” “Good idea.”\\n\\n “If there\u0027s one thing I hate, it\u0027s sea voyages,” said Lavaeolus. He gave the nearest boat a\\n\\n kick. “It\u0027s all idiots striding around and shouting, you know? Pull this, lower that, avast the other. And I get seasick, too.” “It\u0027s heights with me,” said Rincewind, sympathetically.\\n\\n Lavaeolus kicked the boat again, obviously wrestling with some big emotional problem. “The thing is,” he said, wretchedly. “You wouldn\u0027t happen to know if I get home all right, would you?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/eric-discworld-9/page-11.html","bookId":1628,"book":{"id":1628,"title":"Eric (Discworld #9)","description":"Storyline: Eric (Discworld #9) \\n Discworld\u0027s only demonology hacker, Eric, is about to make life very difficult for the rest of Ankh-Morpork\u0027s denizens.
