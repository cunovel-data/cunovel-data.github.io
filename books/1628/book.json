This would-be Faust is very bad...at his work, that is. All he wants is to fulfill three little wishes:to live forever, to be master of the universe, and to have a stylin\u0027 hot babe. But Eric isn\u0027t even good at getting his own way. Instead of a powerful demon, he conjures, well, Rincewind, a wizard whose incompetence is matched only by Eric\u0027s. And as if that wasn\u0027t bad enough, that lovable travel accessory the Luggage has arrived, too. Accompanied by his best friends, there\u0027s only one thing Eric wishes now -- that he\u0027d never been born!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/eric-discworld-9.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":18,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
