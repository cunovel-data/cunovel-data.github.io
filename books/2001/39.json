Disheveled from sleep and with the faint trace of stubble on his jaw, he looked absolutely stunning. “Did last night really happen?”\n One side of his lips tipped up, and my chest swelled. I’d missed that smile. “Depends on what you think happened.”\n “I took my shirt off for you?”\n His eyes deepened. “Yes. Lovely moment.”\n “And you turned me down?”\n The hand on my hip slid lower. “Only because our first time together isn’t going to be when you’re drunk.”\n “Our first time together?”\n “Uh-huh.”\n Muscles in my stomach tightened. “You’re really confident about there being a first between us.”\n “I am.” He tipped back against the cushion.\n I needed to focus. “We talked, right?” My gaze fell to my bare left wrist. “I told you when I did this?”\n “Yes.”\n I peeked at him. “And you don’t think I’m a raving bitch?”\n “Well…”\n Cocking my head to the side, I pinned him with a look.\n Cam’s grin spread as his hand slid further up my back, reaching the nape of my neck. “You want to know what I think?”\n “Depends.”\n He guided my head down so that our mouths were inches apart. “I think we need to talk.”\n “We do.” I agreed even though it made me nervous, of course, but resolve replaced my apprehension.\n Cam suddenly gripped my hips and lifted me off him, placing me on the couch beside him. I missed his warmth immediately. Confusion rose as he stood. “I thought we needed to talk,” I said.\n “We do. I’ll be right back.”\n I had no clue what he was up to.\n “Just stay there, okay?” he said, backing toward the door. “Don’t move from that spot. Don’t think about anything. Just sit there and I’ll be right back.”\n I watched him curiously. “Okay.”\n A lopsided grin appeared. “I mean it, don’t think about anything. Not the last couple of minutes or last night. Not the last month. Or what’s coming next. Just sit there.”\n “Alright,” I whispered. “I promise.”\n His eyes met mine for a second longer, and then he left, and of course I thought about everything in those five minutes he was gone. By the time he returned, I’d almost been convinced that he wasn’t coming back.\n Except he did.\n I twisted around, peering over the back of the couch and once I saw what he had in his hands, I smiled widely. “Eggs—you brought eggs.”\n “And my skillet.” He nudged the door shut with his hip. “And I brushed my teeth.”\n “You didn’t put a shirt on.”\n He cast me a look as he headed into my kitchen. “I know it would break your heart not to be able to see me shirtless.”\n As he disappeared through the door, I dropped my head to the back of the couch and let out a girlie sound that I hoped was muffled.\n “Avery, what in the hell are you doing?”\n I lifted my head. “Nothing.”\n “Then get your ass in here.”\n Grinning, I scampered off the couch and started toward my bedroom.\n “And don’t you dare change.”\n I stopped, making a face.\n “Because I really like seeing you in my clothes,” he added.\n “Well, when you put it like that…” I turned around and made my way back to the kitchen. Lingering in the doorway, I watched him do something I seen him do at least a dozen times.\n He looked over his shoulder at me. “What? You missed my eggs that badly?”\n I blinked my misty eyes clear. “I didn’t think I’d have you in my kitchen making eggs again.”\n The thick bands of muscle across his shoulders flexed, and I couldn’t help but admire the sensual valley. They curved deep into his skin as he leaned forward, adjusting the controls on the stove. “You missed me that much?”\n For once I didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”\n Cam faced me. “I’ve missed you.”\n I took a deep breath. “I want to say I’m sorry for how I acted when you… well, when you saw my scar. I’ve never let anyone see it.” I sucked my lower lip in and took a step forward. “I know that’s not an excuse, because I was a terrible bitch, but…”\n “I’ll accept your apology on one condition.” He folded his arms across his chest.\n “Anything?”\n “You trust me.”\n I cocked my head to the side. “I trust you, Cam.”\n “No, you don’t.” He walked over to my small table and pulled out a chair. “Have a seat.”\n Sitting down, I tugged the hem of his shirt down as he headed back to the stove, putting the tiny skillet over the burner.\n “If you trusted me, you wouldn’t have reacted the way you did,” he simply said, cracking an egg. “And that’s not me judging you or any of that kind of shit. You got to trust me that I’m not going to be an ass or freak out over that kind of stuff. You have to trust that I care enough about you.”\n My breath stalled.\n He turned, his eyes as clear as glass. “There’s a lot I don’t know about you and I hope we fix that. I’m not going to push you, but you can’t shut me out. Okay. You have to trust me.”\n There were a lot of things he didn’t know, but I didn’t want those things to interfere. Not now. Not ever. “I trust you. I will trust you.”\n Cam met my gaze. “I accept your apology.”\n Then he turned back to the stove, scrambling my eggs. Next came the OJ. We really didn’t say anything until he sat down with his four boiled eggs. “So where do we go from here?” he asked. “Tell me what you want.”\n I stopped, my fork full of egg. My gaze flicked up and he was holding one of the eggs. “What I want?”\n “From me.” He bit into the egg, chewing slowly. “What do you want from me?”\n Placing my fork down, I sat back and stared at him. It suddenly occurred to me that he was going to make me say it and… and I needed to say it. I thought about Molly and what she had to say a hundred times. This was easy compared to that. “You.”\n “Me?”\n “I want you.” My cheeks were burning but I pressed forward. “Obviously, I’ve never been in a relationship and I don’t even know if that’s what you want. Maybe it’s not—”\n “It is.” He finished off the egg.\n My chest tightened. “It is?”\n He chuckled. “You sound so surprised, like you can’t believe it.” He picked up another egg. “It’s really kind of adorable. Please continue.”\n “Please continue…?” I shook my head, flustered. “I want to be with you.”\n Cam finished off the second egg. “That’s the second thing we’re in agreement on this morning.”\n “You want to be with me?”\n “I’ve wanted to be with you since the first time you turned me down. I’ve just been waiting for you to come around.” His lips curved up. “So, if we’re going to do this, there are some ground rules.”\n He’d been waiting for me? “Rules?”\n He nodded as he peeled the third egg. “There’s not that many. No shutting me out. It’s just you and me and no one else.” He paused, and my heart was jumping. “And finally, you keep looking damn sexy in my shirts.”\n A laugh burst from me. “I think all of them are doable.”\n “Good.”\n I watched him finish off his eggs and as happy as I was, the nerves got the best of me. “I’ve never done of any of this before, Cam. And I’m not easy to get along with all the time. I know that. I can’t promise this will be easy for you.”\n “Nothing fun in life is easy.” He emptied his glass of milk and then stood, coming to my side. He took my hand and pulled me to my feet. His arms went around my waist as he tilted his head down and when he spoke, his lips brushed my cheek. “I’m serious about you, Avery. If you want me for real, you have me.”\n Closing my eyes, I placed my hands on his chest. “I want you for real.”\n “Good to know,” he murmured, tilting his head to the side and his lips grazed mine. Anticipation swelled like a bubble. “Because if not, this would get a whole lot awkward.”\n I started to laugh, but then his mouth was on mine, quieting me. The kiss was soft at first. A tender exploration of my lips, but it had been too long since he’d kissed me last. And it had been too long since I ever felt like this. I wanted more.\n Sliding my hands up his chest and then the sides of his slightly rough cheeks, I thrust my fingers deep into his messy, soft hair. That was all the encouragement Cam needed. He deepened the kiss, parting my lips as his tongue slipped in. His hands slid to my hips and then up to my waist. He tugged me against him and the kiss went from innocent and sweet to downright sexy in a matter of seconds.\n Cam lifted me, wringing a startled gasp from me that was quickly lost in him. Instinct took over and I wrapped my legs around his waist. In one powerful lunge, he moved forward and my back was against the wall and his chest was flush against mine. My body softened, dampened between my thighs as I felt him there, evidence of how badly he wanted me. Every inch of my body tightened as heat poured into me.\n For the first time, there wasn’t a smidgen of panic. Nothing but wonderful sensations that made me feel alive, and for once, I was completely in control. There was a freedom in that I never experienced before and I threw myself into that kiss. He made that terribly sexy sound that rumbled through his chest and then mine.\n It seemed like forever before he lifted his mouth. “I need to go.”\n I let out a shaky breath. “You’re leaving now?”\n “I’m not a saint, sweetheart,” he all but growled. “So if I don’t leave now, I won’t be leaving for some time.”\n A pulse went from the tips of my breasts to my core. “What if I don’t want you to leave?”\n “Fuck,” he said, sliding his hands down to my thighs. “You’re making this very hard to be the good guy you said I was last night.”\n “I’m not drunk.”\n He pressed his forehead to mine, chuckling softly. “Yeah, I can see that and while the idea of taking you right now, against the wall, is enough to make me lose control, I want you to know that I’m serious. You’re not a hook up. You’re not a friend with benefits. You’re more than that to me.”\n I closed my eyes, breathing heavily. “Well, that was… really sort of perfect.”\n “I’m really sort of perfect,” he replied, gently untangling my legs. He sat me on the floor and I would’ve fallen right over if he hadn’t held on. “Everyone else knows that. You’re just a little slow on the uptake.”\n I laughed. “What are you going to do?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-39.html","bookId":2001,"book":{"id":2001,"title":"Wait for You (Wait for You #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Wait for You (Wait for You #1) \n by J.
