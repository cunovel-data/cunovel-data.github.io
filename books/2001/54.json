And I also knew if I hadn’t met Cam, I wouldn’t be sitting here right now. Maybe I would’ve come around eventually on my own, but I was woman enough to admit that I had help.\\n\\n And I was woman enough that whenever I looked up at the night skies and saw the Corona Borealis—or something that vaguely resembled it—I thanked it.\\n\\n Leaning back against Cam’s chest, I tipped my head back as I reached up, cupping his cheek.

Lynn, Jennifer L. Armentrout \\n Some things are worth waiting for… \\n Traveling thousands of miles from home to enter college is the only way nineteen-year-old Avery Morgansten can escape what happened at the Halloween party five years ago—an event that forever changed her life. All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybe—please God—make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn’t need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future she’s building for herself. \\n Some things are worth experiencing… \\n Cameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple that’s just so… so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed. \\n Some things should never be kept quiet… \\n But when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she’s has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her? \\n And some things are worth fighting for…\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1.jpg","author":"Jennifer L.
