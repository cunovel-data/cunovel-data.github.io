Beneath the thick lashes, his eyes were a vibrant shade of blue. Skin tingling with a thousand tiny pin pricks, I walked over to where he sat. He tipped his head back, his throat working as I stopped in front of him, my fingers curled around where the towel was knotted. His lashes swept down and his lips parted. “Avery.” Placing one hand on his shoulder, I climbed up onto the bed, my knees on either side of his thighs. His hands landed on my towel-covered hips. “Cam?” His lips tipped up on the side and the dimple began to appear in his left cheek. “What are you up to?” “Nothing,” I said, recognizing the breathlessness in my voice. “Everything.” “Those are two opposite things.” “I know.” I lowered myself down onto his lap, shuddering when I felt his arousal through his jeans, pressing against my heat. “Kiss me?” I didn’t wait for his answer. I bent my head down and brushed my lips over his once, twice, and then again, slipping the tip of my tongue over his lower lip and then inside. His grip on my hips tightened, but I was totally in control as I coaxed his mouth open, deepening the kiss. His lips moved against mine, following my lead. I was sure I would melt into him, into the bed. “Touch me?” My lips brushed his. “Please.” Cam obliged. He slipped his hands under the hem of the towel. Both were on my thighs, sliding up and down slowly. Each pass brought his fingers closer to where I wanted him desperately. One stopped along the back of my thigh while the other came tantalizing close to my core. “Now,” I said, lifting my head. Cam chuckled as his fingers inched back up. His knuckles brushed my dampness and then retreated. A groan of frustration escaped me. “What do you want?” he asked, those lashes hiding his eyes. “I want you to touch me.” Another close call as his knuckles brushed me once more and then his hand slid back down my leg. “I am touching you, sweetheart.” “You know what I mean.” “I don’t.” “Please.” I dropped my head to his. “Please touch me, Cam.” Cam tipped his head back again. Our noses brushed and then our lips. “Well, when you say it like, I think I get what you mean.” “Finally,” I groaned. He laughed again and then nipped at my chin as his hand drifted up the inside of my thigh. I jerked as he cupped me fully. “Like this?” “Yes.” His lips pressed down on the center of my throat as his finger slipped inside. “And this?” My eyes closed as my back arched. “Uh-huh.” Cam shifted his hand and his thumb pressed down on the nub of nerves. I gasped as he worked another finger inside me and his body tensed beneath mine. “What about this?” I tipped my hips forward, moaning as my body heated. “Oh, yeah. Definitely that.” “Definitely that,” he murmured, his fingers pumping. Another moan escaped me, but I wanted more. I wanted to feel him inside me, needed him to be. A wild desire born from lust and something far, far stronger. Opening my eyes, mine locked with his. Slowly, I unraveled the knot on my towel and let is slip down my back, falling onto the floor. Cam’s hand stilled and his breathing quickened. He reached up with his free hand, cupping my breast. “Fuck, Avery…” I placed my hand over his, my heart pounding. “Don’t stop.” His thumb moved over my hardened nipple and he growled, “I wasn’t planning on it.” “Not what I meant,” I whispered. Reaching down with my other hand, I found the zipper on his jeans. “I want you, Cam.” “You have me,” he groaned. “You so fucking have me.” A delighted smile appeared as I wrapped my fingers around his wrist. With a level of control I didn’t realize I had, I pulled his hand out from between my thighs. “I really want you.” I flicked open the button on his jeans and pulled his zipper down. My fingers skimmed his hardness and he shuddered. “Don’t you want me?” “More than you know,” he said, lashes lowering as I palmed the length of him. He groaned. “Avery…” I let go of him, long enough to tug his shirt off and toss it aside. He was all golden skin and sleek muscles. “I want this, Cam.” He grabbed my hips, his chest rising sharply. “Are you sure, Avery? Because if you’re not, we don’t have—” Silencing him with a kiss, I slid my hands over his chest. “I’m sure.” His hands flexed on my hips and then in one powerful movement, he had me on my back and he was above me, his eyes bright and intense. He swooped down, claiming my lips in a feverish kiss with so much power and passion. Then he stood, pinning me with a molten stare as he shucked off his jeans. My gaze traveled over his chest, the tattoo, the magnificent abs, and then lower. Cam was huge and an awfully naive part of me wondered how this was going to work. Cam’s heated gaze drifted down my bare skin. My heart fluttered unsteadily, my stomach was full of anticipation. “I could stare at you for a lifetime. It would never grow old.” “Even when I’m old?” “Even then.” Then he lowered himself, trailing his lips over my legs and stomach. He reached my breast, suckling and nipping until my breasts felt heavy and swollen. Cam took his time, slowly moving over me, licking every inch of my skin like he sought to memorize my body or claim it. I didn’t care. He could do it for eternity. Intense heat built in my stomach and spread lower, turning into a glorious ache. For the first time, I wasn’t afraid or unsure of the awakening desire. I wanted to explore it. I wanted Cam to explore it. My body arched against his, aching and tense as he drew out every breath, every moan and whimper. Desire, rife and powerful, spread through me. I had never felt this way before. Cam brought his lips back to mine, supporting himself with his arm, continuing to delve into my mouth while he gently worked one finger into me and then two. Soon he had me buckling under him. Then he lifted his head and there was something intoxicating in his gaze—wild. It mirrored what I felt inside me. He worked me to the edge and then slowly withdrew his fingers. I whimpered, “Cam.” He chuckled as he slid down my body and then his mouth was on me, his tongue moving until my head was thrashing and my hips rolling with abandoned. I felt all over the place, half crazed with need, and when he rolled his fingers over the bundle of nerves, I came, crying out his name. Cam rose swiftly, his gaze fixed on mine as my body trembled. He nudged my thighs apart and there was a twinge of unease, of coldness and darkness, but I pushed it away. I was ready. His erection rested against me and then he slipped in, maybe an inch. “I love you,” Cam said softly, one hand flat against my cheek. “I love you so very much.” I wrapped an arm around his. “I love you.” He kissed me deeply as he dropped a hand to my hip and then his hips thrust into mine. Sharp, stinging pain shot through me. Tears of surprise pricked my eyes and I froze at the incredible pressure of fullness. “Are you okay?” he breathed, stilling. I nodded and then said, “Yes.” Cam’s eyes searched mine as his arm shook around mine. He remained still, buried deep inside me as he lowered his mouth to mine. He kissed me slowly, tenderly, and so deeply that I felt a different kind of tears rise to my eyes. My chest swelled with love and then, finally, the dull ache faded and the pressure inside me started to feel good. I tentatively raised my hips. He groaned. “Av…” I did it again, rocking against him. He cradled my hips, thrusting forward, wringing a cry of pleasure from me. I gripped his shoulders as I wrapped my legs around his waist, bringing him deeper. He moved over me, in me, the intensity increasing until it became a feverish pace. My head spun with the bliss building inside me. He moved faster and his touch was everywhere, his mouth on my breasts, piercing me. Hips grinding, Cam slipped a hand between us and it was too much. I threw my head back, shuddering around him. The moment was incredible. The spasms rocked my body in tight, sensual waves. “Avery,” he grunted my name, burying his head in my shoulder. Two quick thrusts and he came as the last of the tremors rippled through me. Our hearts pounded together, our skin slick with moisture. Minutes went by, maybe hours. I don’t know. When he pulled out slowly, carefully, he kissed me in a way I don’t think he ever had before. “That was… there are no words.” He shook his head, eyes brilliant. “You okay?” “Perfect,” I told him, spreading my hands over the sides of his face. “You were perfect.” Cam dipped his mouth to mine. “Only because I was with you.” Chapter 33 Stepping into the shower the following morning, the hot water pelted deliciously sore muscles. I turned into the spray, letting it wash over my upturned face. Last night… all night…. A big smile pulled at my lips. It had been amazing. Not just the sex—and the sex had been awesomely wonderful—but everything that had come afterward. We were closer than we were before and it hadn’t been the act of sex bringing us together. It had been the act of complete trust in each other. Hearing the soft slid of the shower door, I opened my eyes and turned as Cam stepped in behind me. Completely naked. My gaze dipped. And hard. My cheeks flushed as I folded shy arms across my breasts. Yeah, we were closer, but that didn’t mean standing in the bright light of the bathroom buck ass naked wasn’t intimidating. “You’re beautiful.” Cam smirked a little as he eased my arms away. “And you want to hide yourself?” “Not all of us are blessed with your confidence.” “Uh-huh.” He ran his thumb over my pebbled nipple and then he kissed the corner of my lip as his hands slid up my arms. Water coursed down my back. “I got lonely out there. Thought I’d join you.” “You were lonely?” I stepped closer to him. “Yes.” Cam let his arms fall to my waist. He closed the rest of the distance between us. Our slick skin pressed together and parts of my body got all happy about that. “I ordered breakfast. We have about twenty minutes.” “Twenty minutes to get fresh and clean?” “We only need a couple of minutes for that.” “And what about the rest of those minutes?” Cam didn’t tell me how he wanted to spend those moments. He showed me… in great detail. Kissing me once before latching his mouth onto my breast. A ball of lava formed in my belly as he turned me sideways, the water spraying down on us. Dazed, my hand fluttered to the strands of wet hair. They sifted through my fingers like silk. He slipped his hand between my thighs as he dragged his mouth to mine. He knew exactly how to touch me, how to make come to the brink of control. “Hold on,” he ordered. I wrapped my arms around his neck, letting out a short breath as he lifted me up, pressing my back against the wet tile as he settled between my legs. He brought us together with a slow, torturous thrust. My moans filled the bathroom as his hips pumped. My heart was thundering, a flutter deep in my chest and stomach.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wait-for-you-wait-for-you-1/page-51.html","bookId":2001,"book":{"id":2001,"title":"Wait for You (Wait for You #1)","description":"Storyline: Wait for You (Wait for You #1) by J.
