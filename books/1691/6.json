The chemist\u0027s lab coat was draped over his arm, and his shoulders sagged. He looked exhausted.\n About time he came out of there, Frik thought. He glanced at his Rolex. Four o\u0027clock. Thought he\u0027d never leave. What was he doing all this time?\n From the cover of a thick growth of hibiscus, he watched Paul lock the door and head for his car. He felt ridiculous. Here he was, the owner of this whole complex, hiding from one of his employees so that he could steal a piece of property that already belonged to him.\n I should have demanded it from him, he thought. Should have stuck out my hand and said, Give it to me, Paul. It\u0027s mine.\n Much as he\u0027d wanted to, he hadn\u0027t been able to force the words past his lips. Had he done so, Paul would have known; he\u0027d have looked down on him from the moral high ground he occupied and seen into Frik\u0027s heart. He wouldn\u0027t have uttered a word, but the look in his eyes would have said it all.\n I know what you\u0027re thinking, Frikkie. I know your intentions. You never want this artifact to see the light of day. You want to sail out past the edge of the continental shelf and hurl it into the sea, let the Guyana Current carry it into the abyss.\n And he\u0027d have been right, damn him.\n That was indeed what part of Frikwanted to do. But he wouldn\u0027t. Couldn\u0027t. He\u0027d never forgive himself for destroying a technological boon like that. If need be, he\u0027d hide it, keep it to himself. Not forever, maybe, but for a long, long time.\n He was not a man of science, yet he knew as sure as he knew this morning\u0027s spot price on a barrel of sweet crude that the artifact operated comfortably on principles not even suspected by modern science. Just as surely, he knew simply by looking at the thing that it wouldn\u0027t give up all of its secrets until it was complete.\n When that happened, he would need people he could trust, people like Paul, to help him decode it, decipher its technology and break it down into patentable units to make it Oilstar\u0027s technology. He\u0027d call the shots then.\n Paul\u0027s car cruised out of the parking lot. Frik didn\u0027t move. Best to give the man a few minutes on the road, in case he forgot something and decided to come back. He could think of worse places to hide than among these fragrant red blossoms. A little more time in the bushes wouldn\u0027t kill him.\n The sound of a familiar motor drifted up from the boat dock just down the hill from the lab. Manny had arrived with some of Frik\u0027s favorite supplies, the ones he didn\u0027t want passing through the sticky fingers of the customs inspectors in Port of Spain. He had left the Hummer down there and walked back up, knowing that anyone seeing it there would assume he was on his boat. When he went back down there to pick up his car, he could also pick up his loot.\n The thought encouraged him to pull out his cigar case and remove a long, fat Cohiba Esplendido. He could have a celebratory cigar now without worrying about Paul seeing the smoke.\n As he lit up he thought again about that scene in the lab this morning. Christ, what a moment that had been. He had imagined one of those gizmos attached to every car, truck, train, and plane engine, to every furnace, to every freaking dynamo in every power plant across the world. Frik could see his life\u0027s work crumbling to smoke and ash if this device were reproduced and oil became as old-fashioned as vinyl records.\n Paul had seemed somehow oblivious of the full implications of what he\u0027d found. Yes, he was holding the key to a future free of dependence on fossil fuels. But that key, that odd little contraption he had assembled in there, could make Oilstar obsolete. No...obsolete was a euphemism here.\n Extinctwas more like it.\n Let\u0027s not forget you assembled that thing from piecesI gave you, he thought. It\u0027s not about money, Paul. As it is, I\u0027ve got to rack my brains to begin to find ways to spend theinterest on my holdings. Money hasn\u0027t been the point for a long time. It\u0027s thedoing, Paul. This is my company.\n Frik thought back to when he had left South Africa. His family\u0027s fortunes in land and gemstones could have kept him in Cohibas and fine scotch for a lifetime, but it would have meant being under his father\u0027s thumb. He couldn\u0027t stand that. He\u0027d filled theAssegai with supplies and sailed alone across the Atlantic to make a life he could control.\n I worked as a stinking charter captain for a year to get together a few thousand bucks, he recalled. Hocked my soul for start-up money, sank my first well almost single-handed. Oilstar isn\u0027t just a company, it\u0027s not some soulless corporate entity. It\u0027sme, damnit.\n He was a bull tyrannosaur now, but that little gizmo Paul had assembled in there was a dino-dooming asteroid aimed straight at the heart of Frik\u0027s personal Cretaceous period.\n Think what you will of me, Paul, he thought. I\u0027m not ready to become extinct.\n Figuring he had waited long enough, Frik stepped out of the bushes. As he strolled down the slope to the lab, he fished a set of keys from his pocket.\n Immediately after leaving Paul this morning, he\u0027d returned to his office in San Fernando and put together a full set of keys for the lab building. He just prayed that Paul hadn\u0027t at some time changed the lock on his personal lab.\n He unlocked the front door and hurried down the central hallway. The key fit into Paul\u0027s door...turned. He was in.\n He crossed to the workbench but stopped halfway there. The artifact sat alone in the center of the black surface.\n Christ, Paul hadn\u0027t even bothered to stick it in a drawer. This was not something to leave lying about, even in a locked room.\n He approached it slowly, cautiously, with the proper respect due a thing of such wonder. He leaned close to the bench top and stared at it. No question - there was something unearthly about this thing. Reminded him of the science-fiction paperbacks he\u0027d read when he was a teenager, the ones with the abstract covers by someone named Powers who squiggled bizarre-looking shapes in the backgrounds of his paintings. This thing would have been right at home on one of those covers.\n \"Wheredid you come from?\" Frik muttered.\n He looked around and found the chopstick-length forceps Paul had used earlier. Turning on the bench lamp, he grasped the artifact with the tips of the forceps and lifted. He twisted it, turned it, rotated it this way and that, waiting for the loop of the figure-eight piece to fade away.\n Nothing happened.\n He kept at it, remembering how it had taken Paul a good bit of trial and error this morning before he\u0027d found the precise orientation that made it work, and he\u0027d had a whole night of practice.\n Still nothing.\n Frik felt himself starting to sweat. Why wouldn\u0027t it work? Had Paul taken one of the pieces? No, all four were there. Then what - ?\n \"I thought I\u0027d find you here.\"\n Frik froze. The words had been spoken without inflection, with far more weariness than heat. And that only sharpened their edge. Clamping his cigar between his teeth, he turned to face Paul Trujold\u0027s withering stare.\n \"Oh. Hello, Paul.\" Frik maintained his game face and drew deeply on the Cohiba.\n \"Oh. Hello, Paul,\" Trujold mimicked. \"Is that the best you can do?\"\n The scientist\u0027s dark eyes blazed. Frik fought the urge to step back as Paul stopped two feet in front of him.\n \"What were you going to do with it, Frik?\"\n \"Put it in a secure place. This room is too vulnerable. I\u0027ll feel better if it\u0027s in the safe in my office.\" He held up the artifact, still clasped within the forceps. \"Perhaps you\u0027re forgetting, Paul. This belongs to Oilstar, and Oilstar belongs to me.\"\n \"Yes,Oilstar \u0027s yours Frik, but the artifact belongs to the world. One man can\u0027t be allowed to keep it hidden.\"\n \"Since when do you speak for the world?\"\n \"Sincenow, you selfish son of a bitch.\"\n Frik couldn\u0027t say exactly what happened next, what it was inside that snapped. In his mind, the bizarre object he was holding became a meteor, and Paul the inexorable laws of the universe that were propelling it toward Frik\u0027s world. He reacted the only way he knew. Sure that the scientist was about to grab for the artifact, he dropped it and lunged at the smaller man. He grabbed Paul by the shirtfront and twisted him toward the lab table.\n Paul took a swipe at Frik, knocking the cigar from his mouth instead. The Afrikaner pushed Paul backward into the workbench. It tilted under the force of the impact, and the very air seemed to explode, sending Frikkie staggering in the opposite direction.\n When he recovered his balance, he heard screaming. Paul was rolling on the floor, his body bathed in flame.\n \"Paul! Oh, Christ!\"\n Frantically looking around for a blanket, a lab coat, anything to beat out the flames, Frik spied the red canister of a fire extinguisher on the wall. He ran to it, ripped it free, and carried it over to the wailing ball of flame on the tiles.\n Don\u0027t die on me! he screamed inwardly. God, don\u0027t die on me. I didn\u0027t want that.\n It took him precious seconds to find the safety pin, yank it free, find the trigger, and start spraying. The conical nozzle coughed white plumes of CO2, enveloping Paul and seeming to take forever to douse the flames.\n Frik stared at what had been Paul Trujold. He could recognize the face. Though charred, it had miraculously all but escaped the flames. The rest was nothing more than a twitching, man-shaped thing with only patches of clothing remaining. He didn\u0027t know whether to retch or sob. With the room ablaze, there was time for neither.\n \"Jesus, Frik, get yourself out of here. I\u0027ll get Paul.\"\n Where Manny Sheppard had suddenly appeared from Frik did not know or, at that moment, care.\n Ignoring Trujold\u0027s moans of pain, Manny lifted the man onto his back in a fireman\u0027s carry. Frik started toward the door, but stopped when the artifact caught his eye. It lay at the edge of the flames, and it was burning.\n He reached into the fire with his foot and kicked the object across the floor. The flames were doused by its tumbling flight. As he bent and picked it up, it oozed against his palm, searing his flesh. He cried out in pain that was more than just physical. The device was melting. Ruined. All but its base, which, amazingly, had remained intact and cool to the touch.\n Tucking that against his shirtfront, he lurched toward the door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-6.html","bookId":1691,"book":{"id":1691,"title":"Artifact","description":"Storyline: \n Artifact \n by F.
