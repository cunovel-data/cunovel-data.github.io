{"id":64469,"no":37,"title":"Page 37","content":"Not much outside of restaurants and bars stayed open on the island on Carnival Monday. The occasional minibus driver picked up a load of passengers, the police and fire stations stayed on alert, and the clinic opened its doors, which was fine with Peta. She had no urge whatsoever to participate in Carnival, particularly after her experience with the Jab Jab Molassi. She had no interest in watching the parade or in following it to Grenada National Stadium for the calypso finals and the crowning of the king and queen of the Carnival. It was well into the afternoon before she finished seeing her patients, which was perfect because Ralphie was rarely around before then. His routine was absolute unless he was ill or off-island. He disappeared after his morning sea bath, and appeared again on Morne Rouge Beach in the late afternoon with his knapsack. Settling himself against the fence in front of the house nearest to Gem Holiday Beach Resort, he carved black coral, smoked the occasional joint, and engaged in brief conversations with passers-by. Mostly, he kept to himself. Always, she knew where to find him. She had brought her party clothes from home, figuring she would use the bathroom at her clinic to dress. If it weren\u0027t for carnival, she\u0027d have gone home, then down to the Carenage and hailed a water taxi to take her to Ralphie at Morne Rouge Bay and back to Blue Lagoon Marina. Today, however, was not the day to do that - not with all the drunks and tourists jockeying for space on the Carenage. At about four-thirty, she made her last patient notes and dressed - or more precisely, undressed - to kill, in a miniskirted black T-strap dress. Praying that Ralphie would have her replica ready, she threw a pair of silver stiletto-heeled sandals onto the front seat of the car and, barefoot, drove her Honda down the hill to Gem. He was not yet at his post, so she stopped in for a brief hello with the hotel manager, a woman whose string of children Peta had delivered, picked up a Coke at the beach bar, and walked onto the sand. She could smell the aroma of fresh seafood cooking in the perpetual pot that was kept going by the beach folk. One of them, still dripping from his dive, cracked open a sea urchin and offered it to her. She could not resist the treat. He wouldn\u0027t take any money, so she tossed him a couple of cigarettes. Attracted to the sight of the giveaway, a jailbird con artist whom she knew only as Coconut asked for a smoke. She tossed him one. He grinned and stuck it between his lips before motioning with his hands as if he were striking a match. \"Seen Ralphie?\" she asked, pulling a disposable lighter from her purse. Coconut shook his head. \"Not for a few days. Maybe he go off-island.\" Peta pointed at the small pile of green coconuts at his feet. He pulled his machete from the sand, picked up one of the nuts, a little smaller than an American football, and began the ritual he would have to complete before she could ask him any more questions. Twirling the coconut in his left hand, he expertly swung the machete across the end, trimming away the green husk and exposing the soft interior shell. With a final whack he lopped off the end and handed it to her. She exchanged it for the lighter and drank down the liquid inside the coconut, relishing its cool sweetness. When she\u0027d finished, she handed it back to Coconut, who chopped it open and returned the two halves, along with a shaving from the husk. Using the shaving like a spoon, she scooped out the white, gelatinous insides that off-islanders never saw in the old, dried-out nuts they bought at the supermarket. \"Ralphie has to be around somewhere,\" she said, throwing the empty shells into the nearby tin drum that passed as a trash can. Coconut grinned. \"I find him for you - cost you a pack of smokes.\" Peta sat down on one of Gem\u0027s beach chairs. \"Sure.\" She brushed away a family of no-see-ums that were settling on her arm in anticipation of sundown. \"Why not.\" She adjusted the chair, lay back, and fell asleep. The steel-drum sounds of the New Dimensions, a local reggae and soca group, awakened her an hour later. Their music came from theRhum Runner, a tourist- filled catamaran making a stop on its daily sunset round. Two old ladies sat under a palm tree near the cat, trading baskets of T-shirts. A third had thrown a row of brightly colored towels over the fence. She sat in front of them braiding a tourist\u0027s hair with the help of her granddaughter, a pretty girl of no more than nine. \"Ralphie come soon.\" Coconut plopped himself down on the sand next to her and held out one hand for payment. \"I find him wa-a-y down Grand Anse.\" \"I don\u0027t see him,\" Peta said. \"He come along slow.\" \"Why should I believe you?\" Peta asked, amusing herself. Coconut lifted his machete and grinned. She took a small purse out of her pocket and counted out $1.30 Grenadian, enough for a pack of 555s at the supermarket up the road or a half pack at the bar. \"I\u0027m thirsty for beer,\" Coconut said. Peta shook her head. \"Don\u0027t push your luck.\" He shrugged congenially, as if he had expected no different. \"You be at Fantazia tonight for Calypso Night?\" he asked, pointing at the building attached to the back of Gem\u0027s beachside restaurant, Sur La Mer. \"Maybe,\" Peta said, though she had absolutely no intention of partying there or anywhere else, with the exception of her obligatory appearance on theAssegai . \"Good enough.\" He took off for the bar just as Ralphie strode into view. \"See,\" he called out. \"I told you.\" \"Hey, Ralphie.\" \"Hey, Miss Peta.\" \"You finished the job I gave you?\" \"I finished it.\" He moved off toward the fence. She stood up and followed him. He settled himself on the sand, took out a piece of coral and a small knife, and began to carve. She sat down next to him and waited in companionable silence, knowing he would give her what she wanted in his own time and not before. After half an hour or so, he dug into his bag and pulled out the replica, set in the original gold bezel, and the loose real fragment. She took them from him and examined them closely. There was no way to tell visually which one was the duplicate and which the real thing. The only way she knew the difference was by feel. The original fragment seemed to draw the heat from her hand, making it tingle like pins and needles. The other felt like any piece of carved coral. \"Amazing job, Ralphie. I don\u0027t know how to thank you. You just might have saved my life.\" \"Then I have all the thanks I need,\" he said gravely, and refused all offers of payment. \"I have one more favor to ask.\" She held out the original toward him. \"I don\u0027t want to have this with me tonight. Will you hold it for me until tomorrow?\" He nodded and took it from her. \"Aren\u0027t you curious about this?\" Peta asked. \"I\u0027m curious about how the universe works,\" he answered. Peta smiled at him. He was really something, her friend Ralphie. He could have followed in his family\u0027s political footsteps. He could have lived like a rich man. Instead, he carved coral and sought the secrets of the universe. She thought about Frik, about how his search for the same secrets was motivated by a desire for self-aggrandizement. She leaned over and kissed Ralphie on the cheek. \"If for some reason I don\u0027t come back and get it from you, find Manny Sheppard and give it to him.\" \"You go to come back,\" he said, as if he knew. As Peta neared Blue Lagoon, she heard again the sounds of the New Dimensions. They were doing well for themselves, she thought, wondering if Frik had also hired Bosco, as he usually did. She had known Grenada\u0027s one-man band all of her life, and enjoyed seeing him. He was an event unto himself, playing bass and keyboard, percussion and drums, doing his own arrangements, and playing pan and singing. Cute and fun, he was much in demand. She parked her car outside the marina so that, if necessary, she could leave in a hurry, and footed it the rest of the way. The area was alive with music and people. Rum punch was being poured liberally and everyone was having a high old time, drinking, toking, dancing to the lively steel drums of the local musicians who had apparently forgone their usual gig at the Grenada Grand Beach Resort to oblige Frik. She waved at the musicians and made her way through the crowd. Hiking up her miniskirt, stilettos dangling from her hand, she climbed onto theAssegai . The wooden table had been removed from the deck to make room for a spotlit dance floor. As one song ended and another began, a circle of partygoers gathered around Peta. Some of them began to dance. She slipped into her sandals and moved to the irresistible rhythm of her favorite local calypso, Marsha MacDonald\u0027s \"Going Under.\" \"Go, girl,\" someone yelled. Someone else turned the spotlight on her. Frik. She had noticed him among those who preferred to watch. Now she saw that his gaze was riveted on the pendant she was wearing around her neck. At the end of the song, the musicians closed their set. Frik moved toward her, took her arm, and guided her down into the cabin, where a huge black form lay growling. \"Quiet, Sheba!\" The dog sent out one more test growl, objecting to the invasion of her territory, then stopped. Peta followed the Afrikaner through the boat\u0027s small galley and forward to his private study. The cozy wood-paneled cabin curved with the prow of theAssegai until it formed a point. Cushioned benches lined both walls, broken only on the starboard side by a locked cabinet which she knew contained an entertainment center and his communications equipment. Where the curving walls brought the benches together, a low trapezoidal wooden cabinet served as a display table. Standing in the middle of it was the small wire frame which held the two pieces of the artifact that Frikkie had so far recovered. \"Thank you, again, for coming,\" he said. \"And for bringing the piece.\" Safely out of sight of the revelers, he reached out toward the pendant. \"Not so fast,\" Peta said, enjoying the look on his face as she backed away. Smiling, she asked him to give her the privilege of placing the fragment into the model herself. \"Just a whim,\" she said. \"Humor me.\" A trifle impatiently, Frik agreed. Heart pounding, praying that Ralphie\u0027s work was as perfect as she thought it was, she removed the pendant from around her neck, pushed the fragment out of its bezel and into the space he indicated. It slid in and - Thank you, Ralphie - connected perfectly with the real pieces of the artifact. \"That just leaves Selene\u0027s fragment,\" Frik said. \"And the one that\u0027s in New York with Arthur\u0027s effects.\" \"I\u0027m curious,\" Peta said, trying to sound casual. \"How did you know about that one?\" \"Ray told me just recently,\" Frik said. \"Is that a problem? Itis mine, you know.\" \"A problem? N-no. I don\u0027t suppose it is.\" She had never been completely sure that Frik knew about the piece in New York or, if he did know, just how he had learned about it. Her suspicions about the Daredevil stuntman returned tenfold. \"Ray says the piece is in New York, with Arthur\u0027s effects. I\u0027d like to go and get it,\" Frik went on, his voice carefully benign. Damn it, Peta thought. How was she going to get out of this one? \"It can be released only to me, personally.\" \"So I understand. Why don\u0027t you let me fly you there. We can - \" Peta held up her hand. \"I have a practice. I have students at the medical school coming in this week to begin the new semester and I need to prepare. There\u0027s no way I can leave Grenada right now.\" \"But - \" \"Don\u0027t pressure me, Frik. I\u0027m not one of your flunkies.\" Her anger finally overrode her caution, adding heat to her words. \"I give you my word I\u0027ll retrieve the piece in time for the New Year\u0027s Eve meeting in Vegas. That\u0027ll have to be good enough.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-37.html","bookId":1691,"book":{"id":1691,"title":"Artifact","description":"Storyline: Artifact by F.
