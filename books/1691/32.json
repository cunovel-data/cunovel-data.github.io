{"id":64464,"no":32,"title":"Page 32","content":"Taking a roundabout route, Ray Arno circled the outer perimeter of the encampment, with Peta and the mercenaries forming a ragged line, twenty paces between each of them. As he moved through the mud and underbrush, ignoring the insects and the wetness, he reminded himself that he had been on movie sets that had made him more miserable than this.\n Following naturally was the thought that those jobs had never been as important as this. It wasn\u0027t hyperbole to say that the fate of the world could depend on their success. And that success depended on this assault team.\n Manny and McKendry were good men. Peta was a trooper. The men provided by the Venezuelan minister of security were what gave him pause.\n He had worked with mercenaries before, more than once. The whole point of using them was that they did what they were paid to do. Problems arose only if they were serving two masters, in which case they would do what they had been told to do by the highest bidder.\n According to the plan, Jose should have incapacitated the guitarist, tied him up so they could question him to see if he knew where Selene was. Not kill him. There was nothing Ray could do about it now, but there would be plenty he could do when it was time to make the final payment to Jose.\n Frowning, he looked at the encampment, mentally ticking off at least a dozen safety violations that some OSHA representative on a movie lot would have written up. Here, it might even be an advantage. He knew from Manny\u0027s rough map of the camp where the terrorists kept most of their supplies. What wasn\u0027t on the map was where Green Impact kept its munitions. Food was in sealed lockers, some of which were suspended from trees, though the monkeys could still get at them. The rest of the cases and cans remained in the individual huts.\n Two large propane tanks provided fuel for grills in what passed for the camp\u0027s mess. He was surprised to note as he circled the building that the tanks also ran a heater and water pump attached to a shower at the back of the mess.\n He was examining the tanks when Diego, one of the Venezuelan mercenaries, found the weapons cache in a small, partially camouflaged hut apart from the main encampment. After making whispered calls and gestures, to which Ray, Peta, and the third Venezuelan soon responded, the mercenary used a long knife to pry open the first storage locker.\n Both of Bruzual\u0027s other men dropped their old rifles and hauled out assault rifles and boxes of ammunition, making far too much clatter in their excitement. Ray cautioned them to be quiet, but the mercenaries seemed unduly greedy. He wondered if they would simply snatch the contraband rifles, which they could sell at a handsome profit on the black market, and flee with them.\n Most of all, Ray was concerned with keeping the resources out of the hands of Green Impact.\n He reached a decision. Glancing first at the luminous dial on his wristwatch, he nodded to himself and rapidly opened the rest of the cases. With a shoestring attachment of wires and connected detonators, he rigged up three armed grenades, stuffed them in among packages of C-4 and Semtex, and played out the cord behind himself.\n The Venezuelans looked at him, scowling with disappointment as they saw what he meant to do. Clearly, they would have preferred to confiscate the explosives, not destroy them. Ray held the detonator string in the fingers of one hand and urgently waved them away with the other.\n One of the Green Impact men rustled through the bushes, calling out, \"Hey, what\u0027s going on?\" The voice held annoyance and curiosity, but not suspicion. Not yet.\n Ray yanked the string, pulling the grenade detonator pins. The Green Impact guard, finally doing his duty, switched on a big flashlight and shone it around the jungle. The beam of light, splashing like melted butter across the branches, struck a scrambling Ray and his partners.\n \"Hey! I see you!\" the Green Impact man called out.\n As if on cue, the grenades exploded. Thatch smoldered and burst into flame. Green Impact members started screaming.\n \"I see you too,\" Ray muttered as the shock wave bowled him over into the muddy ground. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-32.html","bookId":1691,"book":{"id":1691,"title":"Artifact","description":"Storyline: \n Artifact \n by F.
