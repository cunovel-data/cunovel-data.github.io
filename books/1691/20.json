{"id":64452,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"At least you didn\u0027t suggest climbing out there to roast marshmallows.\" McKendry pointed at the jet of flame coming from a pipe extended away from the rig, burning off the waste gases before they could build up and become a danger.\\n\\n Keene managed a soft chortle. It blended into the murmur of music and laughter that came from the complex of living quarters. \"They seem to be having a party down there,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Another egregious security lapse. Oilstar could certainly use our services as security consultants,\" McKendry said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll consider making the offer to Frik.\" Keene touched his nose, which had begun to ache from McKendry\u0027s punch.\\n\\n From what he could tell, so many people worked on the rig that it was like a condominium complex. He imagined what it must be like to live in a small cabin, to share common rooms. \"Not the life for me,\" he said. \"Hard work, long hours, boredom - \"\\n\\n \"None of which excuses the lack of security.Nobody tried to stop you?\"\\n\\n Keene shook his head. \"I didn\u0027t see a single human being. This place is wide open to an attack.\" They strolled around the platform, looking in all directions. \"I can\u0027t believe Frik Van Alman is so blind. If Selene Trujold means to strike this rig, she won\u0027t have much trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Especially if she shows up tonight.\" McKendry glanced at his watch. \"It\u0027s almost two-thirty. We should get back to the tanker before the replacement crew decides to do its job and head over there. We can talk to Calisto in the morning and maybe get him to call Frikkie and set up some better security here.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all for that, buddy. Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n They climbed back down the leg of the platform as quickly as possible, not pausing to admire the view of the tanker a quarter mile away. As they swam across the placid water toward theYucatan, Keene thought he sensed movement below him. Despite his professed lack of fear, he got set to defy the laws of motion if he encountered any contact with an undersea creature.\\n\\n \"Hey, McKendry,\" he called out. \"Did you ever read any of those Peter Benchley books? You know,Jaws, The Beast, White Shark ?\"\\n\\n \"Idiot,\" McKendry yelled back, but he put on some speed. Keene was impressed by how little fear there was in his partner\u0027s response. See, he said to himself, it was for your own good, Terris.\\n\\n \"I hope the replacement crew hasn\u0027t come back yet,\" McKendry said, climbing out of the water and scaling the tanker\u0027s hull ladder.\\n\\n Keene was right behind him. \"If they have, we might have a harder time sneaking back to our presidential suite down in the pump room. Let\u0027s see if the captain\u0027s awake. Maybe we can talk ourselves into a decent meal.\"\\n\\n They had reached the deck. Keene could see a group of people at the far end of the tanker, disengaging the long hose that had been filling theYucatan \u0027s hold for hours. The shadowy workers made no noise, quietly going through the motions with all the finesse of a Green Beret squadron instead of a crowd of roughnecks.\\n\\n \"A meal sounds fine to me. I\u0027m so hungry I could eat a shark.\" McKendry grinned.\\n\\n \"Better than the other way around,\" Keene responded. He yawned. \"It\u0027s after three in the morning. Asleep or awake, Calisto\u0027s likely to be in his stateroom.\"\\n\\n They entered the crew quarters, climbed up another level, and reached the larger rooms where the crew and officers slept. McKendry sniffed and frowned. \"Do you smell that? Gunpowder. Cordite...blood.\"\\n\\n \"Looking for trouble, McKendry?\" Keene said. They had reached the captain\u0027s stateroom. The door was not entirely shut and light spilled out. \"Captain?\"\\n\\n Keene tapped lightly on the door. McKendry pushed it wide open. Both men froze.\\n\\n Captain Miguel Calisto lay dead in his chair, shot three times in the chest. Pools of blood seeped along the floor.\\n\\n Keene looked at McKendry. \"I get the feeling,\" he said, \"that we just found Selene.\"\\n\\n Before McKendry could respond, the powerful engines of the OilstarYucatan roared to life. With a lurch, the supertanker began to move. The deck vibrated as the tanker crawled away, detaching itself from the pumping station and heading out into the Caribbean.\\n\\n \"Okay, genius. What now?\" McKendry raised his voice above the noise of the engines.\\n\\n \"We arm ourselves.\" Keene swiped his knuckles across the sweat on his forehead. \"He\u0027s got to have a gun here somewhere.\"\\n\\n He was talking as much to Captain Calisto, slumped in his wooden desk chair, as he was to McKendry. The captain\u0027s corpse was still cooling. An occasional drop of blood oozed from his gunshot wounds, playing counterpoint to the groan of the tanker engines that shuddered through the walls of the bridge superstructure and the crew housing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d settle for a baseball bat,\" McKendry said. Keene knew that his partner was too intent on the imminent crisis to waste words. He moved from cabinet to cabinet, methodically opening cupboard doors, sliding the front panel on an old metal credenza.\\n\\n Though he could smell the sour blood and the bitter residue of gunfire in the air, Keene, like McKendry, ignored the carnage and ransacked the captain\u0027s office. Unlike his methodical partner, his mode was to rifle the captain\u0027s desk with all the organization of a squall at sea. He found nothing useful: two well-watched Spanish-language porn videotapes, three battered paperback novels, some paperwork, a stack of photos that variously showed a grinning Calisto with what seemed to be six different women. The wide middle drawer held pencils, office paraphernalia. A few thin ledgers contained uninspired captain\u0027s logs.\\n\\n The bottom left desk drawer was locked.\\n\\n \"This must be it.\" Keene tugged on the metal handle and pried into the crack without success, making a loud rattling noise that he knew would put McKendry on edge. When the drawer didn\u0027t open, he reached into the central desk drawer and withdrew a letter opener. Though he snapped the blade off in the hasp of the drawer lock, he finally succeeded in jarring it open. \"Now we\u0027re getting somewhere.\"\\n\\n He slid open the drawer and rummaged inside. \"Nothing but crap!\"\\n\\n McKendry came forward, looked down, and frowned. He pulled out a half-empty bottle of cheap scotch whiskey. \"I guess the captain was more worried about someone stealing his booze than his - \"\\n\\n He melted back behind the metal cabin door as footsteps resounded in the corridor outside. A man entered, clearly one of the terrorists. He had high cheekbones, dark hair slicked back with seawater, and a gray jumpsuit with plenty of bulging pockets. His wide black belt was studded with the handles of several weapons or tools.\\n\\n \"Damn,\" he said. He stared at Joshua Keene. \"Looks like we missed one.\"\\n\\n Keene tried to grin disarmingly. \"I\u0027m looking for the gents\u0027 room. Can you direct me, please?\"\\n\\n The terrorist grabbed for a weapon at his belt.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Terris McKendry sprang out from behind the cabin door. Holding the heavy bottle of scotch, he swung it down with the force of a sledgehammer. With a solid crunch of impact between skull and booze bottle, the stranger\u0027s cranium lost the duel. The golden brown liquid sloshed in the bottle as, head bloodied, the terrorist crumpled to the deck.\\n\\n Keene dragged the man deeper into the cabin and closed the door with a kick of his heel. The fallen terrorist did not let out so much as a groan, and Keene didn\u0027t bother to check whether or not he was alive.\\n\\n McKendry nudged the motionless form with the toe of his shoe. \"Green Impact.\" There was no question in his voice. He wiped off the scotch bottle and set it next to the man, as if to offer him a good stiff drink to send him to the underworld.\\n\\n Raising an eyebrow at his friend, Keene said, \"You didn\u0027t spill a drop.\" He looked down at the body. \"I don\u0027t see a badge or anything, but I believe you\u0027re correct. We can make the assumption that Selene Trujold and her goons decided to hit this tanker instead of theValhalla platform, like Frik thought.\"\\n\\n \"Frik isn\u0027t always right.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe she considered this just a warm-up exercise.\"\\n\\n McKendry reached down and pried the dead man\u0027s hand away from his weapon. Instead of a handgun, the terrorist had been trying to draw a large knife, well sharpened, good for throwing or filleting. McKendry took it, examined the wide blade, and shook his head. \"Damn macho South Americans. Can\u0027t they carry a regular firearm like everyone else?\" He slid the knife into his belt just as his partner found the ship-to-shore phone behind the captain\u0027s desk.\\n\\n \"Who do we call? Rescue? Venezuelan military? Trinidad\u0027s coast guard?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s gotta be Frik,\" McKendry said. \"He\u0027s not gonna want this to be handled by anybody but his own people.\"\\n\\n Keene punched in the numbers for Frikkie Van Alman\u0027s private phone on board theAssegai . He listened to it ring until a recording kicked in. \"It\u0027s a friggin\u0027 answering machine,\" he said. \"Pick it up, Frik! We\u0027ve got a crisis here!\"\\n\\n With a clunk and a burst of static, the answering machine cut off and the phone picked up, carrying Frikkie Van Alman\u0027s familiar voice and familiar impatience. \"I\u0027m here. Who is this? What kind of crisis?\"\\n\\n Keene rapidly summarized what they knew so far. He heard the Afrikaner curse and what must have been him punching several buttons on a keyboard or alarm-control panel. \"I\u0027m sending in reinforcements to help you mop up. TheYucatan won\u0027t get far.\" In a clipped voice, loud enough to be heard by both of the men, he reminded them of their primary goal. \"While Selene Trujold is on board, you have one mission that takes precedence over all others. Acquire that artifact she got from her father.\"\\n\\n \"Instead of stomping terrorists? You\u0027ve got weird priorities, Frik,\" Keene said. \"Your tanker\u0027s been hijacked and the crew\u0027s been killed, and all you can think about is a hunk of jewelry?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sending help,\" Frik said. \"You two just stay on top of it there.\"\\n\\n Keene shrugged. \"It\u0027s your problem, Frik. Call up whatever cavalry you want.\"\\n\\n \"Who do you think he\u0027ll send?\" he asked his partner, setting down the receiver.\\n\\n \"Frik?\"\\n\\n \"No. The avenging angel. Of course I meant Frik.\" He looked around the cabin. \"Maybe we should have told him to call in a cleaning crew while he\u0027s at it.\"\\n\\n McKendry shook his head. \"I think you\u0027ve been sniffing blood long enough, Joshua. Let\u0027s get some air.\"\\n\\n Keene opened the cabin door. Bowing slightly, he waved his partner into the passageway and followed him until they reached the football-stadium-sized deck of the oil tanker.\\n\\n Working silently against the thrum of the tanker\u0027s equipment, they circled around theYucatan \u0027s white- painted bridge. Behind the bridge house loomed the radar mast with swiveling radar antennas and satellite dishes. The superstructure bristled with navigation and communication arrays. Foam monitors and fire-fighting stations stood unmanned. A third of the way forward from the bridge house, hose- handling derricks protruded skyward like stripped trees, and numerous pressure and vacuum-relief valves studded the deck like dark warts.\\n\\n White metal rails ran like a spine down the center of the wide deck, flanking the catwalk connecting the fore and aft gantries. The two Daredevils avoided the catwalk and kept to the shadows of bulkheads, vent pipes, and clusters of fifty-gallon drums that held lubricants and waste oil, dirty rags, and powdered absorbents for deck spills.\\n\\n Beneath the square tank hatches, the tanker deck throbbed as the big engines pushed theYucatan through the calm water, heading into the open straits. Far in the distance to the west, Keene could make out the Venezuelan mainland - a dark line with few marks of civilization. Even without a moon overhead, the billions of stars were like pinprick spotlights; the sparkling wire-caged bulbs scattered around the expanse of the giant ship shone down like guard posts around a prison, and the tall and brightValhalla production platform was like a lighthouse towering over the water.\\n\\n Looking at the receding platform, Keene figured that by now the disembarked members of the tanker crew, the lucky ones who had drawn R and R time aboard theValhalla, would have noticed that the ship had pulled away from the loading derrick and lurched silently out to sea.\\n\\n High up, in the center of the top deck, fore and aft walls of windows glowed with yellow light, showing the ship\u0027s main control rooms. Keene looked up and saw shadows moving in the otherwise quiet bridge, two silhouettes inside the control deck, backlit by the fluorescents. One was the trim and compact figure of a woman, directing the show.\\n\\n The woman leaned forward. Her voice came out of the 1950s-era public address system, old bell- shaped metal loudspeakers stationed along the deck. \"Everything is secure. The crew has been eliminated. Dump all the bodies overboard. When Oilstar finally catches up with this ship, I want it to look like theMarie Celeste . They\u0027ll never know how many of their crew members were part of our operations, and they\u0027ll waste time and effort looking for traitors among their own employees.\"\\n\\n \"That must be Selene,\" Keene said. He had expected her to have a French accent, but what came through the speakers was a flattened version of Peta\u0027s Caribbean lilt with a few hints of Spanish.\\n\\n Lucky for Green Impact that the production rig\u0027s efficiency stopped short of security, he thought. She didn\u0027t know that they had called Frik and that Oilstar had its security response on the way, but she must know that her group didn\u0027t have much time. \"She\u0027s gotta act fast. It\u0027s not like you can hide an oil tanker, and these things don\u0027t get up a lot of speed.\"\\n\\n Hunched in the shadows of one of the derrick brackets, McKendry nodded again, which was the usual extent of his conversation during an operation.\\n\\n \"I am afraid the oil load is not what we expected,\" Selene continued. \"Apparently, theYucatan docked at the platform two hours late, so there wasn\u0027t enough time to fill the storage chambers to the level we had hoped.\"\\n\\n From his vantage point, Keene saw several members of Green Impact pause in their furtive duties by the equipment bunkers to look up at her. Before groans could ring out from her team members, she raised her voice. \"There\u0027s enough to send a message around the world. Oilstar will never get this stain off its shoes!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/artifact/page-20.html","bookId":1691,"book":{"id":1691,"title":"Artifact","description":"Storyline: Artifact \\n by F.
