Her little face was scant inches from my face. Her little doggie breath wasn\u0027t so little.\n \"She needs a doggy mint,\" I said.\n \"She doesn\u0027t have bad breath,\" Cindy said.\n \"I beg to differ.\"\n \"You\u0027ve done enough begging for tonight.\"\n \"True,\" I said. \"Still, I\u0027m surprised you can\u0027t see the green radioactive cloud hovering over her head.\"\n \"You have a sensitive nose.\"\n \"I have a sensitive something else, too.\"\n \"Sometimes too sensitive.\"\n \"Let\u0027s change the subject.\"\n Ginger got up and stretched, legs vibrating down into the bed. She turned two circles, lay again and burrowed her little muzzle under her front paws, sighing loudly, absently licking her front paws, eyes closed. I\u0027m not even sure she was awake.\n \"Any leads on the other vandal?\" she asked.\n \"I\u0027m looking into it,\" I said. \"According to the police, Jolene Funkmeyer denies having an accomplice.\"\n \"The word \u0027accomplice\u0027 suggests something more grandiose than vandalism.\"\n \"How about vandal buddy?\"\n \"Better.\"\n \"Anyway,\" I said, \"turns out Jolene has been arrested before.\"\n \"For?\"\n I hesitated. \"Arson.\"\n \"Shit.\"\n \"Spent a year in prison.\"\n \"What did she burn?\"\n \"An abortion clinic in Buena Park. No one hurt. The clinic had been vandalized weeks on end prior to the arson.\"\n \"So the vandalism escalates into something more than vandalism.\"\n I nodded again. \"She was arrested with her boyfriend.\"\n \"You have his name?\"\n \"Chad Schwendinger.\"\n \"You think he\u0027s our man?\"\n \"A good chance,\" I said. \"The Irvine Police checked out his last known address this afternoon. He moved out long ago. And no leads where he might be. Yet.\"\n \"Maybe he\u0027s been shacking up with his vandal girlfriend.\"\n I shook my head. \"I checked out her place this afternoon. She lives alone. Although one neighbor mentioned she had seen a middle-aged man in a BMW come by on a few occasions.\"\n \"Maybe he will want revenge for the arrest of his girlfriend.\"\n \"What he wants and what he gets are two different things.\"\n \"But you\u0027ll still watch over me just in case?\"\n \"Like a hawk,\" I said.\n Chapter Thirty-eight\n Sanchez and I were in my car on a Sunday afternoon, parked outside the big Lutheran church on Fifth and Edinger.\n \"He\u0027s the last one. Name\u0027s Ricardo Gomez,\" said Sanchez, consulting a list of names. There were eight names on the list, seven of which were crossed off.\n \"You do realize we\u0027re outside a church,\" I said.\n Sanchez wasn\u0027t listening. \"Ricardo hasn\u0027t been alone in nearly a week. This might be our only chance to nail him.\"\n \"I think you\u0027ve let this go to your head.\"\n Sanchez looked at me. \"Hell, this went straight to my head the day I heard my boy was in the hospital. This went straight to my head the day eight boys kicked his face in.\"\n \"Take a deep breath,\" I said.\n He ignored me. \"Besides, we\u0027re doing the neighborhood a service. My son has single-handedly broken up this so-called gang. According to his school principal, these kids have been harassing students all year, not to mention vandalizing property.\"\n \"Did the principal know what happened to your son?\"\n Sanchez nodded. \"And he knows my son is picking them off one at a time.\"\n \"What did he say about that?\"\n \"Hallelujah.\"\n \"That because your kid\u0027s name is Jesus?\"\n \"Hay-zeus, asshole.\" Sanchez looked at his big cop watch. \"Church will be out soon.\"\n \"Kid named Jesus kicking ass at church,\" I said. \"Maybe it\u0027s the Second Coming.\"\n There was a box of donuts balanced on the console between us. I had insisted on getting the donuts at the Von\u0027s grocery store this time, which often had better donuts than most hole-in-the-wall chains. Sanchez thought getting donuts at a grocery store was sacrilegious but he ate them anyway.\n \"Church is out,\" Sanchez reported, leaning forward eagerly. \"And there he is, walking home alone.\" I thought Sanchez might wet his pants. He pulled out his notepad and made an entry. I leaned over his shoulder and read the entry: 11:53 AM. Sunday. Church out.\n \"Don\u0027t you have murderers to catch?\" I asked.\n \"Not on Sundays,\" he said. \"Day of rest.\" Then he made another entry: Intercept target. Next Sunday. Noon.\n \"Target?\" I said. \"You need to get a life.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get a life after next Sunday.\"\n \"You have a sprinkle on your chin.\"\n \"Fuck you.\"\n \"Such language at church.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-19.html","bookId":2352,"book":{"id":2352,"title":"The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2) \n Private investigator Jim Knighthorse (from DARK HORSE) takes on a very, very cold case.
