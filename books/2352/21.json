I clicked the door shut behind me, turned, and found myself standing in the living room. A massive mahogany entertainment center was to my immediate right. There was an old couch in front of me, and the kitchen was to my left. Sweat immediately trickled down my sides. The air was thick and hard to breathe. I considered opening the freezer door and sticking my head inside.\\n\\n Nervous excitement fluttered in my stomach. I wasn\u0027t entirely sure what I was looking for, but finding Willie\u0027s cell phone would be a start.\\n\\n The living room was cluttered with fast food wrappers. Hell, there were fast food wrappers on top of fast food wrappers. In New York, rats would have had a field day in here. But out here in the desert, the remains of his meals had gone to a regiment of ants.\\n\\n I stepped over the trail of ants and headed to the first bedroom. The room itself was a disaster, clothes everywhere. Ironically, the hamper was empty. Jarred must have been a lousy shot. The bed was so unmade it appeared to have never been made. Three of the five drawers in his dresser were empty. The other two were full of socks and boxers. I looked under the bed. More clothes.\\n\\n Next was the adjoining bathroom. The light and fan were both still on, and the air was thick with mildew, despite the fan. Water pooled in the center of the bathroom floor. Five or six colognes lined the cabinet below the mirror; three of them toppled over on their sides. The lower half of the mirror was filmy with dried water spots. Shaving scum lined the sink bowl. On the other side of the mirror was a rusted fingernail clipper, Band-aides and wrinkle cream. Maybe it was a man\u0027s wrinkle cream.\\n\\n The second bedroom was used as an office, and apparently it was Jarred\u0027s Holy of Holies. Utterly immaculate. Hell, it even looked freshly vacuumed. His computer was on a desk in one corner of the room. I considered going through his computer files, but doubted I would find the cell phone there. Piles of research books were stacked next to his printer, along with dozens of manila folders. A trashcan next to the desk was filled to overflowing with wadded paper. I un-wadded a few. These appeared to be false starts to the history he was writing on Rawhide. From what I could tell, he had a fair command of the English language, although he used too many commas for my taste. I opened the cupboard above his computer desk. It was mostly empty, other than a small pile of blank CD-ROMs ready to be burned.\\n\\n I left the study and went back through the kitchen and out through the sliding glass door to the backyard. It wasn\u0027t a real backyard. It was a condo backyard, with just enough dirt and grass to give the impression of a backyard. Parallel brick fences ran from the sides of the condo to an attached building. I crossed the yard in three strides and stepped into the semi-attached garage.\\n\\n I flipped a light switch, and a dusty bulb over the doorway sputtered to life.\\n\\n The garage was mostly empty, apparently primarily used to house Jarred\u0027s truck. There was a washer and a dryer and a folded up ping-pong table. The table was covered with cobwebs. Damn waste. Next to the ping-pong table was a dartboard bristling with plastic red and yellow fletches. Boxes were stacked here and there.\\n\\n I decided to check the boxes stacked here, rather than there, and within minutes sweat was dripping steadily from my brow and I felt as if I were being slowly cooked to death in this sweat box of a garage. I imagined my corpse being found hours from now, baked to perfection.\\n\\n Most of the boxes were filled with books. Others were home to black widow spiders. I shuddered. Enough with the spiders, already. I stood there in the garage, hands on hips, wondering if I was barking up the wrong Joshua tree.\\n\\n Maybe Willie Clarke really did run out of gas. And maybe Jarred had nothing to do with it.\\n\\n Maybe.\\n\\n I needed a better plan. There were too many boxes. And certainly too many spiders. If Jarred had indeed sabotaged Willie\u0027s truck, how would he have done it?\\n\\n Standing in the middle of the garage, I closed my eyes. Sweat trickled down my spine. Hell, sweat trickled down everywhere.\\n\\n I pictured Jarred heading back up to Willie\u0027s truck. Pictured Jarred using the keys to unlock Willie\u0027s truck door. Pictured Jarred stealing the bottles of water and cell phone. Pictured Jarred using a siphon hose, sucking on one end, getting the gas flowing, and nervously standing there in the desert while the precious fuel pumped out. Pictured Jarred using some of the water from the bottles to clean out the siphon hose. Pictured Jarred putting the empty bottles and the hose and a cell phone into a...what?\\n\\n I opened my eyes.\\n\\n A gym bag. At least, that\u0027s what I would have used.\\n\\n I would have ditched the gym bag in the desert, but Jarred had Patricia with him. So the gym bag probably went home with him. Where it has stayed because the last thing Jarred expected was a search of his home.\\n\\n I scanned the garage again. There, on some plastic storage shelves in the far corner, was a red gym bag.\\n\\n I sucked in some air and, mentally preparing myself for the possibility of more black widows, crossed the length of the garage, pulled down the gym bag. I set it on some boxes and opened it.\\n\\n Inside were two empty one-gallon bottles of Arrowhead water, a five-foot length of garden hose cut on both ends, and a cell phone. I flipped open the cell phone, turned it on, waited. Music chimed. It still had one bar of battery power left.\\n\\n Using my own phone, I dialed Willie Clark\u0027s number. My finger shook while I dialed. When finished, I pressed send. More shaking. I sucked in some hot air, waited.\\n\\n Waited.\\n\\n The phone in my hand came to life, vibrating and ringing.\\n\\n Chapter Forty-two\\n\\n I met Detective Sherbet at a McDonald\u0027s in downtown Fullerton across the street from the local junior college. The Fighting Hornets, or something. Half the customers who weren\u0027t Fighting Hornets were fighting mothers with kids. I came back carrying a tray filled with burgers and fries and sugar cookies to the table we had staked out in the corner of the dining area.\\n\\n \"Sugar cookies?\" said Sherbet.\\n\\n \"With sprinkles,\" I said. \"The sprinkles, of course, do not imply I am a homosexual.\"\\n\\n Sherbet started on the fries. He ate three at a time, mashing them together to form one huge super fry. Grease glistened between his thumb and forefingers.\\n\\n \"Why would you say something like that?\" he asked.\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Seems to be a concern of yours.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"Now don\u0027t go bringing up my kid again.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s the kid?\"\\n\\n \"Asshole,\" he said. \"The kid\u0027s just fine. In fact, I gave up his neighborhood singing and dancing recital this evening to meet you, so this better be good.\"\\n\\n \"Singing recital?\"\\n\\n Sherbet shrugged, looked a little embarrassed. \"It\u0027s a sort of one-man show. Or a one-kid show. And the kid\u0027s pretty good. Draws a fairly large neighborhood crowd. Stages it in our garage. He bakes cookies with his mother all afternoon, and serves them to anyone who shows up. It\u0027s quite a production.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be disappointed you\u0027re not there.\"\\n\\n Sherbet stopped eating. \"Yeah, he will be.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I should make this quick,\" I said.\\n\\n He sighed. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Maybe you should.\"\\n\\n \"You love that kid.\"\\n\\n \"Yup.\"\\n\\n \"Even though he\u0027s not like you.\"\\n\\n \"I do. Would be easier if he were more like me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay that he\u0027s not. Still your boy.\"\\n\\n Sherbet was about to speak when I jumped in. \"Let me guess: you want to change the subject.\"\\n\\n \"Lord, yes.\" His fries were gone, and he started in on the Big Mac. \"So what do you have for me?\"\\n\\n \"I might just have a killer for you,\" I said. In fact, I knew I had a killer for him, but I couldn\u0027t let on to Sherbet that I had broken into Jarred\u0027s condo. My search was illegal and would raise questions about evidence tampering. Jarred could walk. And I could lose my P.I. license.\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027m interested,\" he said. \"Tell me about it.\"\\n\\n So I did.\\n\\n Sherbet listened silently, working on his Big Mac, taking surprisingly delicate bites for someone who ate his fries three at a time. When I was done, he snorted. \"Even though this Jarred went back for some water, doesn\u0027t mean he sabotaged the vehicle.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"But it gives Jarred opportunity. And since Willie Clarke was later found without his water, or his cell phone for that matter, there is some room for doubt.\"\\n\\n Sherbet mulled this over, staring at me, chewing. The detective had me by about twenty years, but his face was smooth, nearly wrinkle free. His eyes never stopped working, as if he were continually sizing me up. There was grease on his chin, which caught some of the light and gleamed brilliantly.\\n\\n \"Sure, I\u0027ll give you that. If this kid, Willie, brings some water out, there should be some evidence of the bottles. I can tell you there was none. Kid brings his cell phone, he should have it; he didn\u0027t. Kid buys gas, he should have some; he didn\u0027t.\" Sherbet paused. \"Don\u0027t forget he was also found nearly ten miles from his truck. Could have tossed both the empty water bottles and the dead cell phone, and ten miles of desert is a lot of heat and sand to search for a fucking cell phone and some plastic water containers.\"\\n\\n \"Two gallons of water should have gotten him to the main road,\" I said. \"Or at least kept him alive long enough for a passing vehicle to spot him.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, if he didn\u0027t get lost first and waste the water.\"\\n\\n \"We are going in circles,\" I said. \"Dancing.\"\\n\\n \"We are not dancing,\" he said defensively. \"What else do you have?\"\\n\\n \"The way Jarred appeared that Saturday morning unannounced. The way he changed his tune once he returned from Willie\u0027s truck. The way he refused to go back to see if Willie was okay.\" I was leaning forward, my food completely forgotten. A few tables down a student was doing homework with some headphones on, a white cord attached to an iPod sitting on his table. \"Taken individually, yes, sounds like I\u0027m reaching for straws. Taken as a whole, we might have something here.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, so we might have something here. What\u0027s Jarred\u0027s motive for sabotage and murder?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"Notoriety and prestige.\"\\n\\n \"Notoriety and prestige?\" he said dubiously. A crumb had fallen from his mouth and disappeared into his thick arm hair. I wondered how many other crumbs had been lost in there. \"That doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n \"Not to you or me, but to Jarred it makes perfect sense. He is a young historian with something to prove. He staked out Rawhide as his very own. He was going to make a name for himself there, even if that name was only known in very limited circles.\"\\n\\n \"Have you been to Rawhide?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t much.\"\\n\\n \"No. But it\u0027s untapped history.\"\\n\\n Sherbet was done eating. He wadded up the Big Mac wrapper, sat back and folded his arms over his rotund belly. The plastic bench creaked under his weight. \"So he offs his competitor.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"So what do you want from me?\"\\n\\n \"I want you to dust Willie Clarke\u0027s truck for prints.\"\\n\\n He shook his great head. \"Of course there will be prints, Knighthorse. Jarred admitted to going back for water. They\u0027re probably all over the doors.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said.\\n\\n Sherbet thought about it some more, and then the light went on. \"The gas cap.\"\\n\\n \"Bingo,\" I said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-21.html","bookId":2352,"book":{"id":2352,"title":"The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2)","description":"Storyline: The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2) \\n Private investigator Jim Knighthorse (from DARK HORSE) takes on a very, very cold case.
