{"id":66907,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Chapter Twenty-seven\n Sanchez and I sat in my Mustang outside Harbor Junior High in Anaheim. A low vault of cobalt gray clouds hung low in the sky. We were eating donuts and drinking Diet Pepsis, the staples of surveillance. In a few minutes school would be out.\n \"You ever going to get a new car?\" asked Sanchez, sipping his diet soda with one hand, and working on a glazed with the other.\n \"No.\"\n \"How about some air conditioning?\"\n \"How much is air conditioning?\"\n \"Eight, nine hundred bucks.\"\n \"No.\"\n We waited some more. I think I dozed. I felt an elbow in my rib, but might have dreamt it.\n \"You\u0027re snoring.\"\n I sat up. \"Not anymore.\"\n \"Some detective you are.\"\n \"You\u0027re the one detecting,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sleeping.\"\n \"I bought the donuts, which means you\u0027re on my time.\"\n \"Fine,\" I said. \"You have a picture of the kid?\"\n Sanchez removed from his shirt pocket a folded up page torn from a school yearbook. He pointed to a goofy-looking kid with big ears. \"He\u0027s our man.\"\n \"What\u0027s his name?\"\n \"Richard.\"\n We drank some more Diet Pepsi. Occasionally, a cold wind rocked the Mustang, whistling through the cracked windows.\n Sanchez dozed.\n Later, I elbowed him, pointing.\n Richard had emerged from the school\u0027s central hallway with a pack of kids. The pack boarded a waiting bus. We gave pursuit. Along the way, we watched Richard shove a red headed kid\u0027s face into the bus\u0027s rear window. Perhaps amplified by the glass, the freckles along his forehead were huge. Judging by the way that the redhead resigned himself to his fate, I surmised this was a daily routine.\n \"I really don\u0027t like this kid Richard,\" said Sanchez.\n \"Yup,\" I said. \"Then again, the other kid is red headed.\"\n \"True.\"\n The bus dropped Richard off, along with a half dozen other kids. We followed Richard home from a safe distance. Along the way, we watched him turn over three trashcans and knock over a \"For Sale By Owner\" sign in front of a house.\n Sanchez said, \"I ought to bust his ass for vandalism.\"\n \"You realize we\u0027re trained investigators following a twelve-year-old kid.\"\n \"Kid or no kid, he took part in a pre-meditated beating of a defenseless eleven-year-old. My defenseless eleven-year-old,\" said Sanchez. \"And I\u0027m the only trained investigator here. You\u0027re just a rent-a-dick.\"\n \"Hey, we both fell asleep.\"\n The kid turned into an ugly white home, and promptly chased away an ugly orange cat off the wooden porch. He went inside. Sanchez pulled out a notebook and wrote something down.\n \"What are you doing?\"\n Sanchez checked his watch. \"Noting the mark\u0027s time of movements, assessing the daily routine.\"\n \"Did you include abusing the redhead?\"\n Sanchez ignored me. When finished, he snapped the notebook shut. \"Same time tomorrow, but this time we bring Jesus.\"\n \"Good,\" I said. \"I could use some more ice cream.\"\n Chapter Twenty-eight\n I was in the desert city of Barstow, otherwise known as the Great Las Vegas Rest Stop. I wasn\u0027t resting. I was actually working, sitting in front of a microfilm machine on the third floor of Barstow Junior College library.\n Earlier, a rather pretty college student with hair so blond it was almost white showed me how to operate the machine. I might have flubbed my first few attempts just to be shown the process all over again.\n Now, after being thoroughly trained, I zipped through some of the oldest issues of the Barstow Times, currently scanning headlines in the 1880\u0027s. Barstow is an old city, and its newspaper is one of the oldest in the region. Next to me, sweating profusely, was a regular Coke. I love regular Coke, and sneak it in when the mood strikes. After driving through 100-degree weather in a vehicle with no air conditioning, the mood struck and I ran with it.\n The headlines were fairly mundane. Cattle sold. Drops in silver prices. Heat waves. Oddly, no mention of terrorists, nuclear fallout, Lotto results, or presidential scandals.\n I was looking beyond headlines at what would be considered the filler articles. Most historians agree that Sylvester died no later than 1880. He was found in 1901. Like a good little detective, I was going to sift through every page of every newspaper published between January 1, 1880 and December 31, 1900.\n I may need some more Coke.\n Most of the news was indeed about Barstow, but there was the occasional mention of neighboring Rawhide and its wealthy family, the Barrons. From all accounts, the three Barron boys were hellraisers, always in some scrap or another, constantly bailed out by their wealthy family. Fights, shootouts, drunken misconduct, and wild parties. They were the Wild West\u0027s equivalent to rock stars. Their raucous exploits often made the front page, along with pictures. I suspected I was seeing the birth of the paparazzi.\n It took me two hours to go through the years 1880 and 1881. At this pace, I would be here all night. I wondered if the cute librarian would pull an all-nighter with me.\n In March of 1884, I came across something interesting. One of the Barron boys, Johansson Barron, had been in a barroom fight with a silver miner. According to the article and witnesses, it wasn\u0027t much of a fight: the Barron kid stabbed the miner from behind. The miner was later treated for a superficial wound to his left shoulder, but appears to have been okay.\n A week later, the very same miner disappeared.\n His disappearance rallied the whole town, probably because he had had the guts to stand up to a Barron. A thorough search of all the local mines was conducted. Search parties scouted the local hills. Nothing. The miner was gone, leaving behind a wife and five children.\n The miner\u0027s name was Boonie Adams.\n I thought about Boonie Adams some more, then looked at my watch, in which I started thinking about lunch. I decided to get the hell out of Dodge. Or at least Barstow.\n As I headed back out into the desert, with a fresh Coke nestled in my lap, I was feeling giddy. I was fairly certain I had found my man, and luckily there was one way to know for sure. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mummy-case-jim-knighthorse-2/page-14.html","bookId":2352,"book":{"id":2352,"title":"The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Mummy Case (Jim Knighthorse #2) \n Private investigator Jim Knighthorse (from DARK HORSE) takes on a very, very cold case.
