Thanks also to our little Peapod, who we will miss forever. This book is dedicated to my dad, Bert de la Cruz, true blue in every sense of the word, who has heroes\u0027 blood in his veins. This book would not exist without the love, support, insight, and intelligence of my husband, Mike Johnston, to whom I owe everything. The family was not simply the sum of the connections created by a large, extended set of relations... a family... was a name, a material and symbolic patrimony, and a form of stakeholding in America... \"describing a total lineage, past, present and future.\" - Eric Homberger, Mrs. Astor\u0027s New York You can\u0027t push it underground You can\u0027t stop it screaming out How did it come to this? You will suck the life out of me... - Muse, \"Time Is Running Out\" One hundred and two people arrived on the Mayflower in November of 1620, but less than half lived to see the establishment of the Plymouth Colony the next year. While no one had died during the Mayflower\u0027s voyage, life after arrival was extremely difficult, especially for the young. Almost all of the lost were hardly sixteen years of age. The staggering mortality rate was partly due to a harsh winter, as well as the fact that, while the men were out in the air, building homes and drinking fresh water, women and children were confined to the damp, crowded recesses of the ship, where disease could spread much more quickly. After the two-month voyage, they remained on the ship for an additional four months while the men built storehouses and living quarters on land. Young Puritans routinely cared for the sick, increasing their exposure to a vast array of illnesses, including a fatal affliction of the blood that historical documents called \"consumption.\" Myles Standish was elected governor of the colony in 1622 for thirty consecutive one-year terms. He and his wife Rose had fourteen children, a remarkable seven sets of twins. In an extraordinary turn of events, within a few years, the colony had doubled in size, with multiple births reported in all the surviving families. - From Death and Life in the Plymouth Colonies, 1620ï¿½C1641 by Professor Lawrence Winslow Van Alen Catherine Carver\u0027s Diary 21st of November, 1620 The Mayflower It has been a difficult winter. The sea does not agree with John, and we are always cold. Perhaps we will find peace in this new land, although many believe we have not left danger behind. Outside my window, the coastline resembles Southampton, and for that I am grateful. I will always long for home, but our kind are no longer safe there. I myself do not believe the rumors, but we must do as instructed. It has always been our way. John and I are traveling as husband and wife now. We are planning on marrying soon. There are far too few of us, and more are needed if we are to survive. Perhaps things will change. Perhaps good fortune will shine on us, and our situation will ameliorate. The ship has anchored. We have landed. A new world awaits. - C.C.

I am a fan of vampire lore, or good ones, at least, so I had to pick this up at my friendly local library. Was I surprised - or perhaps not, coming from the author of \u0027Au Pairs\u0027- that this book had very little to do with vampires. The first 100 or so pages had absolutely no vampire mentions, and hardly any insinuations that vampires would come up later. Even after that the whole \u0027Guess what, I\u0027m a vampire, and nearly everyone around you is too...oh yeah, and blood is indeed a necessity\u0027 thing is merely a side plot. Mainly, this book concerns Schuyler, an outcast of sorts, dealing with the Queen Bee, Mimi Force, and her gorgeous twin brother, and other high school dramas such as that. It takes a look at the high end of society, where teens learn to drip money without showing it off...","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blue-bloods-blue-bloods-1.jpg","author":"Melissa de la Cruz","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blue-bloods-blue-bloods-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:40:38 PM"}}
