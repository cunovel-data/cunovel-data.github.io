The river which they had been following here joined a broader river, wide and turbulent, which flowed from their left to their right, towards the east. Beyond this new river a delightful country rose gently in low hills, ridge beyond ridge, to the Northern Mountains themselves. To the right there were rocky pinnacles, one or two of them with snow clinging to the ledges. To the left, pine-clad slopes, frowning cliffs, narrow gorges, and blue peaks stretched away as far as the eye could reach. He could no longer make out Mount Pire. Straight ahead the mountain range sank to a wooded saddle which of course must be the pass from Archenland into Narnia.\\n\\n \"Broo-hoo-hoo, the North, the green North!\" neighed Bree: and certainly the lower hills looked greener and fresher than anything that Aravis and Shasta, with their southern-bred eyes, had ever imagined. Spirits rose as they clattered down to the water\u0027s-meet of the two rivers.\\n\\n The eastern-flowing river, which was pouring from the higher mountains at the western end of the range, was far too swift and too broken with rapids for them to think of swimming it; but after some casting about, up and down the bank, they found a place shallow enough to wade. The roar and clatter of water, the great swirl against the horses\u0027 fetlocks, the cool, stirring air and the darting dragon-flies, filled Shasta with a strange excitement.\\n\\n \"Friends, we are in Archenland!\" said Bree proudly as he splashed and churned his way out on the Northern bank. \"I think that river we\u0027ve just crossed is called the Winding Arrow.\"\\n\\n \"I hope we\u0027re in time,\" murmured Hwin.\\n\\n Then they began going up, slowly and zigzagging a good deal, for the hills were steep. It was all open park-like country with no roads or houses in sight. Scattered trees, never thick enough to be a forest, were everywhere. Shasta, who had lived all his life in an almost tree-less grassland, had never seen so many or so many kinds. If you had been there you would probably have known (he didn\u0027t) that he was seeing oaks, beeches, silver birches, rowans, and sweet chestnuts. Rabbits scurried away in every direction as they advanced, and presently they saw a whole herd of fallow deer making off among the trees.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it simply glorious!\" said Aravis.\\n\\n At the first ridge Shasta turned in the saddle and looked back. There was no sign of Tashbaan; the desert, unbroken except by the narrow green crack which they had travelled down, spread to the horizon.\\n\\n \"Hullo!\" he said suddenly. \"What\u0027s that!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s what?\" said Bree, turning round. Hwin and Aravis did the same.\\n\\n \"That,\" said Shasta, pointing. \"It looks like smoke. Is it a fire?\"\\n\\n \"Sand-storm, I should say,\" said Bree.\\n\\n \"Not much wind to raise it,\" said Aravis.\\n\\n \"Oh!\" exclaimed Hwin. \"Look! There are things flashing in it. Look! They\u0027re helmets - and armour. And it\u0027s moving: moving this way.\"\\n\\n \"By Tash!\" said Aravis. \"It\u0027s the army. It\u0027s Rabadash.\"\\n\\n \"Oh course it is,\" said Hwin. \"Just what I was afraid of. Quick! We must get to Anvard before it.\" And without another word she whisked round and began galloping North. Bree tossed his head and did the same.\\n\\n \"Come on, Bree, come on,\" yelled Aravis over her shoulder.\\n\\n The race was very gruelling for the Horses. As they topped each ridge they found another valley and another ridge beyond it; and though they knew they were going in more or less the right direction, no one knew how far it was to Anvard. From the top of the second ridge Shasta looked back again. Instead of a dust-cloud well out in the desert he now saw a black, moving mass, rather like ants, on the far bank of the Winding Arrow. They were doubtless looking for a ford.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re on the river!\" he yelled wildly.\\n\\n \"Quick! Quick!\" shouted Aravis. \"We might as well not have come at all if we don\u0027t reach Anvard in time. Gallop, Bree, gallop. Remember you\u0027re a war-horse.\"\\n\\n It was all Shasta could do to prevent himself from shouting out similar instructions; but he thought, \"The poor chap\u0027s doing all he can already,\" and held his tongue. And certainly both Horses were doing, if not all they could, all they thought they could; which is not quite the same thing. Bree had caught up with Hwin and they thundered side by side over the turf. It didn\u0027t look as if Hwin could possibly keep it up much longer.\\n\\n At that moment everyone\u0027s feelings were completely altered by a sound from behind. It was not the sound they had been expecting to hear - the noise of hoofs and jingling armour, mixed, perhaps, with Calormene battle-cries. Yet Shasta knew it at once. It was the same snarling roar he had heard that moonlit night when they first met Aravis and Hwin. Bree knew it too. His eyes gleamed red and his ears lay flat back on his skull. And Bree now discovered that he had not really been going as fast - not quite as fast - as he could. Shasta felt the change at once. Now they were really going all out. In a few seconds they were well ahead of Hwin.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not fair,\" thought Shasta. \"I did think we\u0027d be safe from lions here!\"\\n\\n He looked over his shoulder. Everything was only too clear. A huge tawny creature, its body low to the ground, like a cat streaking across the lawn to a tree when a strange dog has got into the garden, was behind them. And it was nearer every second and half second.\\n\\n He looked forward again and saw something which he did not take in, or even think about. Their way was barred by a smooth green wall about ten feet high. In the middle of that wall there was a gate, open. In the middle of the gateway stood a tall man dressed, down to his bare feet, in a robe coloured like autumn leaves, leaning on a straight staff. His beard fell almost to his knees.\\n\\n Shasta saw all this in a glance and looked back again. The lion had almost got Hwin now. It was making snaps at her hind legs, and there was no hope now in her foamflecked, wide-eyed face.\\n\\n \"Stop,\" bellowed Shasta in Bree\u0027s ear. \"Must go back. Must help!\"\\n\\n Bree always said afterwards that he never heard, or never understood this; and as he was in general a very truthful horse we must accept his word.\\n\\n Shasta slipped his feet out of the stirrups, slid both his legs over the left side, hesitated for one hideous hundredth of a second, and jumped. It hurt horribly and nearly winded him; but before he knew how it hurt him he was staggering back to help Aravis. He had never done anything like this in his life before and hardly knew why he was doing it now.\\n\\n One of the most terrible noises in the world, a horse\u0027s scream, broke from Hwin\u0027s lips. Aravis was stooping low over Hwin\u0027s neck and seemed to be trying to draw her sword. And now all three - Aravis, Hwin, and the lion were almost on top of Shasta. Before they reached him the lion rose on its hind legs, larger than you would have believed a lion could be, and jabbed at Aravis with its right paw. Shasta could see all the terrible claws extended. Aravis screamed and reeled in the saddle. The lion was tearing her shoulders. Shasta, half mad with horror, managed to lurch towards the brute. He had no weapon, not even a stick or a stone. He shouted out, idiotically, at the lion as one would at a dog. \"Go home! Go home!\" For a fraction of a second he was staring right into its wideopened, raging mouth. Then, to his utter astonishment, the lion, still on its hind legs, checked itself suddenly, turned head over heels, picked itself up, and rushed away.\\n\\n Shasta did not for a moment suppose it had gone for good. He turned and raced for the gate in the green wall which, now for the first time, he remembered seeing. Hwin, stumbling and nearly fainting, was just entering the gate: Aravis still kept her seat but her back was covered with blood.\\n\\n \"Come in, my daughter, come in,\" the robed and bearded man was saying, and then \"Come in, my son\" as Shasta panted up to him. He heard the gate closed behind him; and the bearded stranger was already helping Aravis off her horse.\\n\\n They were in a wide and perfectly circular enclosure, protected by a high wall of green turf. A pool of perfectly still water, so full that the water was almost exactly level with the ground, lay before him. At one end of the pool, completely overshadowing it with its branches, there grew the hugest and most beautiful tree that Shasta had ever seen. Beyond the pool was a little low house of stone roofed with deep and ancient thatch. There was a sound of bleating and over at the far side of the enclosure there were some goats. The level ground was completely covered with the finest grass.\\n\\n \"Are - are - are you,\" panted Shasta. \"Are you King Lune of Archenland?\"\\n\\n The old man shook his head. \"No,\" he replied in a quiet voice, \"I am the Hermit of the Southern March. And now, my son, waste no time on questions, but obey. This damsel is wounded. Your horses are spent. Rabadash is at this moment finding a ford over the Winding Arrow. If you run now, without a moment\u0027s rest, you will still be in time to warn King Lune.\"\\n\\n Shasta\u0027s heart fainted at these words for he felt he had no strength left. And he writhed inside at what seemed the cruelty and unfairness of the demand. He had not yet learned that if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one. But all he said out loud was:\\n\\n \"Where is the King?\"\\n\\n The Hermit turned and pointed with his staff. \"Look,\" he said. \"There is another gate, right opposite to the one you entered by. Open it and go straight ahead: always straight ahead, over level or steep, over smooth or rough, over dry or wet. I know by my art that you will find King Lune straight ahead. But run, run: always run.\"\\n\\n Shasta nodded his head, ran to the northern gate and disappeared beyond it. Then the Hermit took Aravis, whom he had all this time been supporting with his left arm, and half led, half carried her into the house. After a long time he came out again.\\n\\n \"Now, cousins,\" he said to the Horses. \"It is your turn.\"\\n\\n Without waiting for an answer - and indeed they were too exhausted to speak - he took the bridles and saddles off both of them. Then he rubbed them both down, so well that a groom in a King\u0027s stable could not have done it better.\\n\\n \"There, cousins,\" he said, \"dismiss it all from your minds and be comforted. Here is water and there is grass. You shall have a hot mash when I have milked my other cousins, the goats.\"\\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Hwin, finding her voice at last, \"will the Tarkheena live? Has the lion killed her?\"\\n\\n \"I who know many present things by my art,\" replied the Hermit with a smile, \"have yet little knowledge of things future. Therefore I do not know whether any man or woman or beast in the whole world will be alive when the sun sets tonight. But be of good hope. The damsel is likely to live as long as any of her age.\"\\n\\n When Aravis came to herself she found that she was lying on her face on a low bed of extraordinary softness in a cool, bare room with walls of undressed stone. She couldn\u0027t understand why she had been laid on her face; but when she tried to turn and felt the hot, burning pains all over her back, she remembered, and realized why. She couldn\u0027t understand what delightfully springy stuff the bed was made of, because it was made of heather (which is the best bedding) and heather was a thing she had never seen or heard of.\\n\\n The door opened and the Hermit entered, carrying a large wooden bowl in his hand. After carefully setting this down, he came to the bedside, and asked:\\n\\n \"How do you find yourself, my daughter?\"\\n\\n \"My back is very sore, father,\" said Aravis, \"but there is nothing else wrong with me.\"\\n\\n He knelt beside her, laid his hand on her forehead, and felt her pulse.\\n\\n \"There is no fever,\" he said. \"You will do well. Indeed there is no reason why you should not get up tomorrow. But now, drink this.\"\\n\\n He fetched the wooden bowl and held it to her lips. Aravis couldn\u0027t help making a face when she tasted it, for goats\u0027 milk is rather a shock when you are not used to it. But she was very thirsty and managed to drink it all and felt better when she had finished.\\n\\n \"Now, my daughter, you may sleep when you wish,\" said the Hermit. \"For your wounds are washed and dressed and though they smart they are no more serious than if they had been the cuts of a whip. It must have been a very strange lion; for instead-of catching you out of the saddle and getting his teeth into you, he has only drawn his claws across your back. Ten scratches: sore, but not deep or dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"I say!\" said Aravis. \"I have had luck.\"\\n\\n \"Daughter,\" said the Hermit, \"I have now lived a hundred and nine winters in this world and have never yet met any such thing as Luck. Them is something about all this that I do not understand: but if ever we need to know it, you may be sure that we shall.\"\\n\\n \"And what about Rabadash and his two hundred horse?\" asked Aravis.\\n\\n \"They will not pass this way, I think,\" said the Hermit. \"They must have found a ford by now well to the east of us. From there they will try to ride straight to Anvard.\"\\n\\n \"Poor Shasta!\" said Aravis. \"Has he far to go? Will he get there first?\"\\n\\n \"There is good hope of it,\" said the old man.\\n\\n Aravis lay down again (on her side this time) and said, \"Have I been asleep for a long time? It seems to be getting dark.\"\\n\\n The Hermit was looking out of the only window, which faced north. \"This is not the darkness of night,\" he said presently. \"The clouds are falling down from Stormness Head. Our foul weather always comes from there in these parts. There will be thick fog tonight.\"\\n\\n Next day, except for her sore back, Aravis felt so well that after breakfast (which was porridge and cream) the Hermit said she could get up. And of course she at once went out to speak to the Horses. The weather had changed and the whole of that green enclosure was filled, like a great green cup, with sunlight. It was a very peaceful place, lonely and quiet.\\n\\n Hwin at once trotted across to Aravis and gave her a horse-kiss.\\n\\n \"But where\u0027s Bree?\" said Aravis when each had asked after the other\u0027s health and sleep.\\n\\n \"Over there,\" said Hwin, pointing with her nose to the far side of the circle. \"And I wish you\u0027d come and talk to him. There\u0027s something wrong, I can\u0027t get a word out of him.\"\\n\\n They strolled across and found Bree lying with his face towards the wall, and though he must have heard them coming, he never turned his head or spoke a word.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Bree,\" said Aravis. \"How are you this morning?\"\\n\\n Bree muttered something that no one could hear.\\n\\n \"The Hermit says that Shasta probably got to King Lune in time,\" continued Aravis, \"so it looks as if all our troubles are over. Narnia, at last, Bree!\"\\n\\n \"I shall never see Narnia,\" said Bree in a low voice.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you well, Bree dear?\" said Aravis.\\n\\n Bree turned round at last, his face mournful as only a horse\u0027s can be.\\n\\n \"I shall go back to Calormen,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What?\" said Aravis. \"Back to slavery!\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Bree. \"Slavery is all I\u0027m fit for. How can I ever show my face among the free Horses of Narnia? - I who left a mare and a girl and a boy to be eaten by lions while I galloped all I could to save my own wretched skin!\"\\n\\n \"We all ran as hard as we could,\" said Hwin.\\n\\n \"Shasta didn\u0027t!\" snorted Bree. \"At least he ran in the right direction: ran back. And that is what shames me most of all. I, who called myself a war-horse and boasted of a hundred fights, to be beaten by a little human boy - a child, a mere foal, who had never held a sword nor had any good nurture or example in his life!\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" said Aravis. \"I felt just the same. Shasta was marvellous. I\u0027m just as bad as you, Bree. I\u0027ve been snubbing him and looking down on him ever since you met us and now he turns out to be the best of us all. But I think it would be better to stay and say we\u0027re sorry than to go back to Calormen.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all very well for you,\" said Bree. \"You haven\u0027t disgraced yourself. But I\u0027ve lost everything.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/115/5687.html","bookId":449,"book":{"id":449,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：能言马与男孩The Horse and His Boy","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Horse and His BoyBegun in March, completed end of July 1950[9] and published 6 September 1954, The Horse and His Boy takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290820232ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/115","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
