{"id":41460,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"RABADASH THE RIDICULOUS\\n\\n THE next turn of the road- brought them out from among the trees and there, across green lawns, sheltered from the north wind by the high wooded ridge at its back, they saw the castle of Anvard. It was very old and built of a warm, reddish-brown stone.\\n\\n Before they had reached the gate King Lune came out to meet them, not looking at all like Aravis\u0027s idea of a king and wearing the oldest of old clothes; for he had just come from making a round of the kennels with his Huntsman and had only stopped for a moment to wash his doggy hands. But the bow with which he greeted Aravis as he took her hand would have been stately enough for an Emperor.\\n\\n \"Little lady,\" he said, \"we bid you very heartily welcome. If my dear wife were still alive we could make you better cheer but could not do it with a better will. And I am sorry that you have had misfortunes and been driven from your father\u0027s house, which cannot but be a grief to you. My son Cor has told me about your adventures together and all your valour.\"\\n\\n \"It was he who did all that, Sir,\" said Aravis. \"Why, he rushed at a lion to save me.\"\\n\\n \"Eh, what\u0027s that?\" said King Lune, his face brightening. \"I haven\u0027t heard that part of the story.\"\\n\\n Then Aravis told it. And Cor, who had very much wanted the story to be known, though he felt he couldn\u0027t tell it himself, didn\u0027t enjoy it so much as he had expected, and indeed felt rather foolish. But his father enjoyed it very much indeed and in the course of the next few weeks told it to so many people that Cor wished it had never happened.\\n\\n Then the King turned to Hwin and Bree and was just as polite to them as to Aravis, and asked them a lot of questions about their families and where they had lived in Narnia before they had been captured. The Horses were rather tongue-tied for they weren\u0027t yet used to being talked to as equals by Humans grown-up Humans, that is. They didn\u0027t mind Aravis and Cor.\\n\\n Presently Queen Lucy came out from the castle and joined them and King Lune said to Aravis, \"My dear, here is a loving friend of our house, and she has been seeing that your apartments are put to rights for you better than I could have done it.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d like to come and see them, wouldn\u0027t you?\" said Lucy, kissing Aravis. They liked each other at once and soon went away together to talk about Aravis\u0027s bedroom and Aravis\u0027s boudoir and about getting clothes for her, and all the sort of things girls do talk about on such an occasion.\\n\\n After lunch, which they had on the terrace (it was cold birds and cold game pie and wine and bread and cheese), King Lune ruffled up his brow and heaved a sigh and said, \"Heigh-ho! We have still that sorry creature Rabadash on our hands, my friends, and must needs resolve what to do with him.\"\\n\\n Lucy was sitting on the King\u0027s right and Aravis on his left. King Edmund sat at one end of the table and the Lord Darrin faced him at the other. Dar and Peridan and Cor and Corin were on the same side as the King.\\n\\n \"Your Majesty would have a perfect right to strike off his head,\" said Peridan. \"Such an assault as he made puts him on a level with assassins.\"\\n\\n \"It is very true,\" said Edmund. \"But even a traitor may mend. I have known one that did.\" And he looked very thoughtful.\\n\\n \"To kill this Rabadash would go near to raising war with the Tisroc,\" said Darrin.\\n\\n \"A fig for the Tisroc,\" said King Lune. \"His strength is in numbers and numbers will never cross the desert. But I have no stomach for killing men (even traitors) in cold blood. To have cut his throat in the battle would have eased my heart mightily, but this is a different thing.\"\\n\\n \"By my counsel,\" said Lucy, \"your Majesty shall give him another trial. Let him go free on strait promise of fair dealing in the future. It may be that he will keep his word.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe Apes will grow honest, Sister,\" said Edmund. \"But, by the Lion, if he breaks it again, may it be in such time and place that any of us could swap off his head in clean battle.\"\\n\\n \"It shall be tried,\" said the King: and then to one of the attendants, \"Send for the prisoner, friend.\"\\n\\n Rabadash was brought before them in chains. To look at him anyone would have supposed that he had passed the night in a noisome dungeon without food or water; but in reality he had been shut up in quite a comfortable room and provided with an excellent supper. But as he was sulking far too furiously to touch the supper and had spent the whole night stamping and roaring and cursing, he naturally did not now look his best.\\n\\n \"Your royal Highness needs not to be told,\" said King Lune, \"that by the law of nations as well as by all reasons of prudent policy, we have as good right to your head as ever one mortal man had against another. Nevertheless, in consideration of your youth and the ill nurture, devoid of all gentilesse and courtesy, which you have doubtless had in the land of slaves and tyrants, we are disposed to set you free, unharmed, on these conditions: first, that-\"\\n\\n \"Curse you for a barbarian dog!\" spluttered Rabadash. \"Do you think I will even hear your conditions? Faugh! You talk very largely of nurture and I know not what. It\u0027s easy, to a man in chains, ha! Take off these vile bonds, give me a sword, and let any of you who dares then debate with me.\"\\n\\n Nearly all the lords sprang to their feet, and Corin shouted:\\n\\n \"Father! Can I box him? Please.\"\\n\\n \"Peace! Your Majesties! My Lords!\" said King Lune. \"Have we no more gravity among us than to be so chafed by the taunt of a pajock? Sit down, Corin, or shaft leave the table. I ask your Highness again, to hear our conditions.\"\\n\\n \"I hear no conditions from barbarians and sorcerers,\" said Rabadash. \"Not one of you dare touch a hair of my head. Every insult you have heaped on me shall be paid with oceans of Narnian and Archenlandish blood. Terrible shall the vengeance of the Tisroc be: even now. But kill me, and the burnings and torturings in these northern lands shall become a tale to frighten the world a thousand years hence. Beware! Beware! Beware! The bolt of Tash falls from above!\"\\n\\n \"Does it ever get caught on a hook half-way?\" asked Corin.\\n\\n \"Shame, Corin,\" said the King. \"Never taunt a man save when he is stronger than you: then, as you please.\"\\n\\n \"Oh you foolish Rabadash,\" sighed Lucy.\\n\\n Next moment Cor wondered why everyone at the table had risen and was standing perfectly still. Of course he did the same himself. And then he saw the reason. Aslan was among them though no one had seen him coming. Rabadash started as the immense shape of the Lion paced softly in between him and his accusers.\\n\\n \"Rabadash,\" said Aslan. \"Take heed. Your doom is very near, but you may still avoid it. Forget your pride (what have you to be proud of?) and your anger (who has done you wrong?) and accept the mercy of these good kings.\"\\n\\n Then Rabadash rolled his eyes and spread out his mouth into a horrible, long mirthless grin like a shark, and wagged his ears up and down (anyone can learn how to do this if they take the trouble). He had always found this very effective in Calormen. The bravest had trembled when he made these faces, and ordinary people had fallen to the floor, and sensitive people had often fainted. But what Rabadash hadn\u0027t realized is that it is very easy to frighten people who know you can have them boiled alive the moment you give the word. The grimaces didn\u0027t look at all alarming in Archenland; indeed Lucy only thought Rabadash was going to be sick.\\n\\n \"Demon! Demon! Demon!\" shrieked the Prince. \"I know you. You are the foul fiend of Narnia. You are the enemy of the gods. Learn who I am, horrible phantasm. I am descended from Tash, the inexorable, the irresistible. the curse of Tash is upon you. Lightning in the shape of scorpions shall be rained on you. The mountains of Narnia shall be ground into dust. The-\"\\n\\n \"Have a care, Rabadash,\" said Aslan quietly. \"The doom is nearer now: it is at the door: it has lifted the latch.\"\\n\\n \"Let the skies fall,\" shrieked Rabadash. \"Let the earth gape! Let blood and fire obliterate the world! But be sure I will never desist till I have dragged to my palace by her hair the barbarian queen, the daughter of dogs, the -\"\\n\\n \"The hour has struck,\" said Aslan: and Rabadash saw, to his supreme horror, that everyone had begun to laugh.\\n\\n They couldn\u0027t help it. Rabadash had been wagging his ears all the time and as soon as Aslan said, \"The hour has struck!\" the ears began to change. They grew longer and more pointed and soon were covered with grey hair. And while everyone was wondering where they had seen ears like that before, Rabadash\u0027s face began to change too. It grew longer, and thicker at the top and larger eyed, and the nose sank back into the face (or else the face swelled out and became all nose) and there was hair all over it. And his arms grew longer and came down in front of him till his hands were resting on the ground: only they weren\u0027t hands, now, they were hoofs. And he was standing on all fours, and his clothes disappeared, and everyone laughed louder and louder (because they couldn\u0027t help it) for now what had been Rabadash was, simply and unmistakably, a donkey. The terrible thing was that his human speech lasted just a moment longer than his human shape, so that when he realized the change that was coming over him, he screamed out:\\n\\n \"Oh, not a Donkey! Mercy! If it were even a horse - e\u0027en - a hor - eeh - auh, eeh-auh.\" And so the words died away into a donkey\u0027s bray.\\n\\n \"Now hear me, Rabadash,\" said Aslan. \"Justice shall be mixed with mercy. You shall not always be an Ass.\"\\n\\n At this of course the Donkey twitched its ears forward and that also was so funny that everybody laughed all the more. They tried not to, but they tried in vain.\\n\\n \"You have appealed to Tash,\" said Aslan. \"And in the temple of Tash you shall be healed. You must stand before the altar of Tash in Tashbaan at the great Autumn Feast this year and there, in the sight of all Tashbaan, your ass\u0027s shape will fall from you and all men will know you for Prince Rabadash. But as long as you live, if ever you go more than ten miles away from the great temple in Tashbaan you shall instantly become again as you now are. And from that second change there will be no return.\"\\n\\n There was a short silence and then they all stirred and looked at one another as if they were waking from sleep. Aslan was gone. But there was a brightness in the air and on the grass, and a joy in their hearts, which assured them that he had been no dream: and anyway, there was the donkey in front of them.\\n\\n King Lune was the kindest-hearted of men and on seeing his enemy in this regrettable condition he forgot all his anger.\\n\\n \"Your royal Highness,\" he said. \"I am most truly sorry that things have come to this extremity. Your Highness will bear witness that it was none of our doing. And of course we shall be delighted to provide your Highness with shipping back to Tashbaan for the - er - treatment which Aslan has prescribed. You shall have every comfort which your Highness\u0027s situation allows: the best of the cattleboats - the freshest carrots and thistles -\"\\n\\n But a deafening bray from the Donkey and a well-aimed kick at one of the guards made it clear that these kindly offers were ungratefully received.\\n\\n And here, to get him out of the way, I\u0027d better finish off the story of Rabadash. He (or it) was duly sent back by boat to Tashbaan and brought into the temple of Tash at the great Autumn Festival, and then he became a man again. But of course four or five thousand people had seen the transformation and the affair could not possibly be hushed up. And after the old Tisroc\u0027s death when Rabadash became Tisroc in his place he turned out the most peaceable Tisroc Calormen had ever known. This was because, not daring to go more than ten miles from Tashbaan, he could never go on a war himself: and he didn\u0027t want his Tarkaans to win fame in the wars at his expense, for that is the way Tisrocs get overthrown. But though his reasons were selfish, it made things much more comfortable for all the smaller countries round Calormen. His own people never forgot that he had been a donkey. During his reign, and to his face, he was called Rabadash the Peacemaker, but after his death and behind his back he was called Rabadash the Ridiculous, and if you look him up in a good History of Calormen (try the local library) you will find him under that name. And to this day in Calormene schools, if you do anything unusually stupid, you are very likely to be called \"a second Rabadash\".\\n\\n Meanwhile at Anvard everyone was very glad that he had been disposed of before the real fun began, which was a grand feast held that evening on the lawn before the castle, with dozens of lanterns to help the moonlight. And the wine flowed and tales were told and jokes were cracked, and then silence was made and the King\u0027s poet with two fiddlers stepped out into the middle of the circle. Aravis and Cor prepared themselves to be bored, for the only poetry they knew was the Calormene kind, and you know now what that was like. But at the very first scrape of the fiddles a rocket seemed to go up inside their heads, and the poet sang the great old lay of Fair Olvin and how he fought the Giant Pire and turned him into stone (and that is the origin of Mount Pire - it was a two-headed Giant) and won the Lady Liln for his bride; and when it was over they wished it was going to begin again. And though Bree couldn\u0027t sing he told the story of the fight at Zalindreh. And Lucy told again (they had all, except Aravis and Cor, heard it many times but they all wanted it again) the tale of the Wardrobe and how she and King Edmund and Queen Susan and Peter the High King had first come into Narnia.\\n\\n And presently, as was certain to happen sooner or later, King Lune said if was time for young people to be in bed. \"And tomorrow, Cor,\" he added, \"shalt come over all the castle with me and see the estres and mark all its strength and weakness: for it will be thine to guard when I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n \"But Corin will be the King then, Father,\" said Cor.\\n\\n \"Nay, lad,\" said King Lune, \"thou art my heir. The crown comes to thee.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t want it,\" said Cor. \"I\u0027d far rather-\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis no question what thou wantest, Cor, nor I either. \u0027Tis in the course of law.\"\\n\\n \"But if we\u0027re twins we must be the same age.\"\\n\\n \"Nay,\" said the King with a laugh. \"One must come first. Art Corin\u0027s elder by full twenty minutes. And his better too, let\u0027s hope, though that\u0027s no great mastery.\" And he looked at Corin with a twinkle in his eyes.\\n\\n \"But, Father, couldn\u0027t you make whichever you like to be the next King?\"\\n\\n \"No. The king\u0027s under the law, for it\u0027s the law makes him a king. Hast no more power to start away from thy crown than any sentry from his post.\"\\n\\n \"Oh dear,\" said Cor. \"I don\u0027t want to at all. And Corin - I am most dreadfully sorry. I never dreamed my turning up was going to chisel you out of your kingdom.\"\\n\\n \"Hurrah! Hurrah!\" said Corin. \"I shan\u0027t have to be King. I shan\u0027t have to be King. I\u0027ll always be a prince. It\u0027s princes have all the fun.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s truer than thy brother knows, Cor,\" said King Lune. \"For this is what it means to be a king: to be first in every desperate attack and last in every desperate retreat, and when there\u0027s hunger in the land (as must be now and then in bad years) to wear finer clothes and laugh louder over a scantier meal than any man in your land.\"\\n\\n When the two boys were going upstairs to bed Cor again asked Corin if nothing could be done about it. And Corin said:\\n\\n \"If you say another word about it, I\u0027ll - I\u0027ll knock you down.\"\\n\\n It would be nice to end the story by saying that after that the two brothers never disagreed about anything again, but I am afraid it would not be true. In reality they quarrelled and fought just about as often as any other two boys would, and all their fights ended (if they didn\u0027t begin) with Cor getting knocked down. For though, when they had both grown up and become swordsmen, Cor was the more dangerous man in battle, neither he nor anyone else in the North Countries could ever equal Corin as a boxer. That was how he got his name of Corin Thunder-Fist; and how he performed his great exploit against the Lapsed Bear of Stormness, which was really a Talking Bear but had gone back to Wild Bear habits. Corm climbed up to its lair on the Narnian side of Stormness one winter day when the snow was on the hills and boxed it without a time-keeper for thirty-three rounds. And at the end it couldn\u0027t see out of its eyes and became a reformed character.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/115/5692.html","bookId":449,"book":{"id":449,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：能言马与男孩The Horse and His Boy","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Horse and His BoyBegun in March, completed end of July 1950[9] and published 6 September 1954, The Horse and His Boy takes place during the reign of the Pevensies in Narnia, an era which begins and ends in the last...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1290820232ab323.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/115","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:47 AM"}}
