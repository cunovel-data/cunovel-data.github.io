But then, anything to escape that laughing. Aye, now that makes sense . Why, I’d probably ride straight up Hood’s arsehole to get away from that lot . And as soon as I smell something sweet, boys and girls, why, I’ll ride straight back and tell you . That dust cloud looked closer. Maybe. CHAPTER SEVEN ‘Awaiting Restitution’ Epigraph on gravestone, Lether ‘IS IT AS I SEE?’ BRYS BEDDICT ASKED. ‘THE FATE OF THE WORLD IN THE hands of three women?’ Atri-Ceda Aranict drew one more time on the stick and then flicked the stub into the fire. Into flames … She held the smoke in her lungs as long as she could, as if in refusing to breathe out she could hold back time itself. I saw caverns. I saw darkness … and the rain, gods below, the rain … Finally, she sighed. If there was any smoke left she didn’t see it. ‘Not three women alone,’ she said. ‘There is one man. You.’ They sat undisturbed before the fire. Soldiers slept. The bawling of animals awaiting slaughter had died down for the night. Cookfires dwindled as the swirling wind ate the last dung, and the air was filled with ashes. Come the dawn … we leave. Broken apart, each our separate ways. Could I have imagined this? Did she know? She must have. By her sword we are shattered . ‘It was necessary,’ said Brys. ‘You sound as if you are trying convince yourself,’ she observed, drawing a taper from her belt sheath and reaching to set one end into the flames. Watched as it caught. Brought the lurid fire closer to her face to light yet another stick. ‘I understood her, I think.’ He grunted. ‘Well, as much as anyone could.’ She nodded. ‘The look on the faces of her officers.’ ‘Stunned. Yes.’ She thought of Fist Blistig. ‘Appalled.’ He glanced across at her. ‘I worried for you, my love. Abrastal’s daughter—’ ‘A potent child indeed, to find us from so far away.’ She pulled on the stick. ‘I was unprepared. The visions made no sense. They overwhelmed me.’ ‘Are you able to make sense of them now?’ ‘No.’ ‘Will you describe them to me, Aranict?’ She dropped her gaze. ‘Forgive me for asking,’ he said. ‘I did not think – you should not have to relive such trauma. Ah, I am tired and tomorrow will be a long day.’ She heard the invitation in his words, but the flames of the hearth held her in place. Something. A promise. A warning. I need to think on this . ‘I will join you, love, soon.’ ‘Of course. If you find me dead to the world …’ She flinched, recovered and said, ‘I shall be careful not to wake you.’ He leaned close and she turned to meet his lips with hers. Saw the tenderness of his smile as he pulled away. Then she was alone, and her gaze returned again to the flames. A parley. A meeting of minds. Well . It had begun simply enough. Regal riders reining before the command tent, soldiers appearing to take the horses. Greetings exchanged with the Malazan officers awaiting these distinguished guests. The Adjunct was within, yes. Her wounds? She has recovered, thankfully. We’re afraid there will be little formality in all this, Highness – is it not best that we each make our own introductions? Mortal Sword, Shield Anvil, it is good to see you both … Fist Faradan Sort had held to her own standard of formality, Aranict supposed. Both comfortable and respectful. Whereas Fists Kindly and Blistig had said nothing, the tension between the two men palpable. She’d stood close to Commander Brys. It was difficult to know where to look. The Khundryl women, Hanavat and Shelemasa, held back from the others, as if uncertain of their own worth. As words were exchanged between Sort and Krughava and Abrastal on the matter of who should enter first – a clash of deference, of all things – Aranict edged back a step and made her way over to the Khundryl. They observed her approach with evident trepidation. Aranict stopped, drew out her pouch and counted out three sticks of rustleaf. She held them up with brows raised. Sudden smiles answered her. She stood and smoked with them, a few paces back from all the others, and Aranict caught Brys’s eye and was pleased by the pride she saw in her lover’s regard. It was finally determined that Queen Abrastal would be the first to enter, accompanied by the Barghast Warchief Spax, followed by the Perish. When faces turned to the Khundryl women, Hanavat gestured with one hand – clearly, now that she had something to do, she was content to wait. Shelemasa seemed even more relieved.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-89.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
