Find my sister.’\n ‘Did you see those defences, sir?’ Kalam demanded. ‘How do you hope to get the Perish to surrender? They can stop the Host right here, right now.’\n But Paran was frowning. ‘Why didn’t that demon tear you to pieces, Kalam?’\n The assassin looked away, shrugged. ‘Met it before. Did it a favour. Maybe. I think. Can’t remember exactly. But it was back in Seven Cities, the middle of the Whirlwind. Things happened.’\n ‘You weave a fine tale, Kalam,’ Quick Ben observed.\n ‘I leave the endlessly flapping mouth to you, wizard.’\n ‘Clearly a wise decision. But next time, just summarize.’\n Six High Watered officers stood uneasily before Erekala, twenty paces behind them the blackened stain and charred wreckage of the Pure’s tent, from which embers still blinked open and closed like glowing eyes amidst the ashes, and smoke lifted its black pall.\n The times the Perish commander had had occasion to engage with these mixed-bloods, they had looked upon him with disdain. Now such superiority had been swept away, in a conflagration of fire. Brother Serenity was dead. But uttering that statement was akin to stating the impossible. One rank below Reverence and Diligence, Serenity’s power had been immense, matched only by that of Calm – or so Erekala had been led to believe.\n And Serenity has this night fallen to two Malazans. And come the dawn, we shall face in battle eight thousand more. But did the Pure Brother heed my caution? He did not . ‘We have found blood trails leading out from the Pure’s tent,’ he now said. ‘It is fair to assume that Brother Serenity fought hard against his assailants; indeed, that he might have seriously wounded them, perhaps even killed one.’\n But he could see no effect from these words. Sighing, Erekala continued, ‘Will you elect one among you to assume command of the Shriven? Alternatively, you can place yourselves under my command. Dawn is fast approaching, sirs, and we shall soon be locked in battle.’\n One of the officers stepped forward. ‘Sir, in all matters tactical, Brother Serenity instructed us to obey your commands.’\n Erekala nodded. ‘As you have done.’\n ‘Sir,’ the officer began, and then hesitated.\n ‘Speak your mind.’\n ‘The Pures have felt Brother Serenity’s death. They are wounded, confused, and from them we receive no guidance. Indeed, Akhrast Korvalain itself has been damaged here.’\n ‘Damaged?’ This was unexpected. ‘How so?’\n ‘Another Hold manifested here, last night.’\n ‘Indeed?’ He scanned the faces before him. ‘Perhaps you too readily discounted the efficacy of seven thousand Perish praying to their gods.’\n ‘We do not speak of the Beast Hold, sir.’\n Erekala was silent, for now he was the one left shaken. In a quiet voice he asked, ‘And have you identified the intruder, sir?’\n ‘Not us, Commander. Sister Reverence, however – from the storm of her thoughts, we sense her … recognition .’\n ‘Go on.’\n The man shook his head. ‘This is all we have, sir.’\n ‘Is it now your thought that another ancient Hold has set itself against Akhrast Korvalain?’\n ‘We would know more of these Malazans, sir.’\n Erekala frowned. ‘Have you become uncertain regarding my preparations here?’\n ‘No, Commander. Today, the enemy shall be savaged, possibly shattered. But we seek to understand – are these Malazans nothing more than humans?’\n ‘No different from us Perish, you mean?’\n ‘Then … do they too serve an Elder God?’\n ‘The Malazan Empire long ago outlawed cults of war in its military … but that is not to say that there are no secret believers among the ranks.’ He studied the faces arrayed before him. ‘Has it not occurred to the Forkrul Assail that, in so forcefully asserting the power of Akhrast Korvalain, they would invite the attention of the other Elder Holds?’\n ‘It was our understanding that across most of this realm the Holds were abandoned, giving way to a younger ascendancy.’\n Erekala cocked his head. ‘And was this the case for the Perish?’\n At last, a faint sneer from the officer. ‘You were judged an aberration.’\n The commander smiled. ‘We can resume this discussion at a later time. You will descend among the Shriven and take command of your companies.’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-351.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
