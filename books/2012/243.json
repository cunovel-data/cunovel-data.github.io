I think not.’ She nodded. ‘Draconus will kill you!’ She faced him with burning eyes. ‘It was only a plan, my beloved son.’ BOOK SIX TO ONE IN CHAINS If you knew where this path led Would you have walked it? If you knew the pain at love’s solemn end Would you have awakened it? In darkness the wheel turns In darkness the dust dims In red fire the wheel burns In darkness the sun spins If you knew the thought in your head Would you have spoken it? If by this one word you betrayed a friend Would you have uttered it?

Will all these struggles Fade into white? Or melt like snow on stone In the heat of dawn? Do you feel my hands? These weathered wings Of dreams of flight – stripped – Are gifts worn down. Still I hold fast and climb sure Through your eyes – Who waits for me Away from the ravaged nests The scenes of violence Any searching will easily find The broken twigs The tufts of feather and hair The spilled now drying – Did you spring alight Swift away unharmed? So many lies we leave be The sweet feeding to make us strong But the rows are unmoving And we journey without a step What I dare you to lose I surrendered long ago But what I beg you to find Must I then lose? In these rows there are tales For every line, every broken smile Draw close then And dry these tears For I have a story to tell The Unwitnessed Fisher kel Tath THESE SOLDIERS . THE TWO WORDS HUNG IN HER MIND LIKE MEAT from butcher hooks. They twisted slowly, aimlessly. They dripped, but the drips had begun to slow. Lying on her side atop the packs of wrapped food, Badalle could let her head sink down on one side and see the rough trail stretching away behind them. Not much was being left behind now – barring the bodies – and beneath the light of the Jade Strangers those pale shapes looked like toppled statues of marble lining a long-abandoned road. Things with their stories gone, their histories for ever lost. When she tired of that view, she could set her gaze the opposite way, looking ahead, and from her vantage point the column was like a swollen worm, with thousands of heads upon its elongated back, each one of them slave to the same crawling body. Every now and then the worm cast off a part of it that had died, and these pieces were pushed out to the sides. Hands would reach down from those walking past, collecting up fragments of clothing which would be used during the day, stitched together to make flies – gifts of shade from the dead – and by the time those discarded pieces came close to her, why, they’d be mostly naked, and they’d have become marble statues. Because, when things fail, you topple the statues . Directly before her, the bared backs of the haulers glistened with precious sweat as they strained in their yokes. And the thick ropes twisted as they went taut and gusted out breaths of glittering dust all down their length. They call these soldiers heavies. Some of them anyway. The ones who don’t stop, who don’t fall down, who don’t die. The ones who scare the others and make them keep going. Until they fall over dead. Heavies. These soldiers . She thought back. The sun had been spilling out along the horizon. The day was going away, and it had been a day when no one had spoken, when the Snake had been silent. She had been walking three paces behind Rutt, and Rutt walked hunched over around Held, who was huddled in his arms, and Held’s eyes were closed against the glare – but then, they were always closed, because so much in the world was too hard to look at.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-243.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
