I will be fighting the power of their will. I will be preventing it from reaching my soldiers.’\\n\\n ‘But you gave up your damned sword, woman!’\\n\\n ‘There are residual effects to bearing such a weapon, Fist. In any case, none of that is your concern.’\\n\\n ‘Except when you fail. When you fall.’\\n\\n ‘Even then, Fist.’\\n\\n His eyes narrowed on her. ‘That only works if you take them down with you. Is that the plan, Adjunct? One final sacrifice to defend an army that doesn’t even like you? That doesn’t want to be here? That doesn’t even know what it’s supposed to be fighting for? And then you expect me and the other Fists to hold them together? With you dead and gone?’\\n\\n She cocked her head. ‘You are contradicting yourself.’\\n\\n He waved a dismissive hand, the gesture chopping the air.\\n\\n Tavore seemed to flinch slightly at that, but the tone of her next words belied the impression. ‘Maintain your line with the flanks, Fist.’\\n\\n ‘We’re going to get cut to pieces.’\\n\\n Turning away, she reached for her leather gloves. ‘If so, Fist, just make sure you take a long time dying.’\\n\\n He left without bothering to salute, walked with his helm dangling from one hand.\\n\\n Three foiled attempts on my life? A corrupted Claw?\\n\\n Then who did the foiling?\\n\\n Banaschar stood twenty paces away from her tent, motionless while figures moved in measured haste around him, wanting to be a heavy stone in the stream, a place to set a foot and find an instant or two of rest. But his was a lifeless island, until Lostara Yil found him, taking his arm in hers and pulling him round – Henar Vygulf grinning off to one side.\\n\\n ‘What is this?’ Banaschar demanded, only vaguely resisting as she led him away – he’d just seen Blistig exit Tavore’s tent, his stride echoing that of a lifeless T’lan Imass, and he’d been considering going to the Adjunct again, to see what he could glean of what had taken place between her and the Fist. Instead, he was being pulled away.\\n\\n And there, ahead, stood a small group of officers. Skanarow. Ruthan Gudd, Raband and Faradan Sort.\\n\\n Banaschar sought to disengage his arm. ‘You keep forgetting, I’m not actually in this army.’\\n\\n ‘Our last palaver,’ said Lostara. ‘Make it mocking, make it solemn, however you like it, Priest. But it will happen, and you will be in attendance.’\\n\\n ‘Why?’\\n\\n They’d reached the others, and Banaschar saw the expectation in their faces and wanted to hide under a shield.\\n\\n Ruthan Gudd, fingers combing his beard, was the first to speak. ‘Priest. We’ve all been given our orders. Will you be at the Adjunct’s side through all of this?’\\n\\n All of what? The dying? ‘I don’t know. I doubt it.’\\n\\n ‘Why?’ asked Faradan Sort, the word sharp, accusing.\\n\\n He shrugged. ‘I expect she will be fighting. Eventually.’\\n\\n Lostara Yil cleared her throat in the silence that followed, and then said, ‘She has ordered me, Henar and Ruthan Gudd to attend to her at all times.’\\n\\n ‘That makes sense,’ Banaschar said.\\n\\n ‘It’s the Forkrul Assail, isn’t it?’\\n\\n To Lostara’s question Banaschar simply shrugged again.\\n\\n ‘She has surrendered her sword, somewhere,’ said Faradan Sort. ‘How does she expect to defend herself against the sorcery of the Assail?’\\n\\n ‘I don’t know.’\\n\\n Raband voiced a raw curse and looked ready to leave, but Skanarow shook her head at him and he subsided, scowling.\\n\\n Lostara caught Banaschar’s eye – he could see fear in hers. ‘Priest, I do not think I will again Shadow Dance. Not the way I did before. If she is expecting such a thing from me – perhaps against the Forkrul Assail—’\\n\\n ‘Captain, I don’t know what she is expecting,’ said Banaschar quietly. ‘You and Ruthan Gudd, you have both shown exceptional abilities. Is that why she wants you close? I imagine that it is, and at the moment of greatest need, will she look to you two? Why wouldn’t she?’\\n\\n ‘I can’t do it again!’\\n\\n Banaschar glanced over at Ruthan Gudd. ‘And what of you, Captain? Besieged by the same uncertainties, are you? Or will the gift of the Stormriders reawaken to protect you?’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-420.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
