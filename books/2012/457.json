Reached desperately for warrens, but nothing awakened – it was all being destroyed. Every path, every gate. Life’s myriad fires were being snuffed out, crushed like dying embers.\n What have I done?\n They are following – they trusted in me! My lord and his followers are coming – there is no stopping that, but they will arrive in a realm which they cannot leave .\n Where flies Korabas, there shall be T’iam!\n What have I done?\n Suddenly, in the distance ahead, sure as a dreaded dawn, the rift she had made tore open wide, and five dragons sailed out, their vast shadows rushing towards her. Four were black as onyx, the fifth the crimson hue of blood.\n Desra. Skintick. Korlat. Silanah. Nimander.\n And awaiting them, in the skies above this world, between earth and the fiery heavens, the air swarmed with their kin. And Korabas.\n At war.\n She saw her lord and his followers drawn into that maelstrom – all lost, stolen away by what was coming.\n Where flies Korabas, there shall be T’iam .\n And the goddess of the Eleint had begun to manifest.\n Panicked, weeping, Apsal’ara began running again, and there, in the distance, beckoned a hill crowded with crags and boulders, and upon that hill there were figures.\n As Fiddler turned to face the west, he found himself staring at the most massive dragon he had ever seen. Harried by scores of lesser dragons, seemingly torn to shreds, it was labouring straight for them.\n He spun – the Adjunct’s sword was now bleeding coppery, rust-stained light, visibly trembling where it was driven into the earth. Oh no. We’re all dead .\n The land beneath the Otataral Dragon was withering, crumbling to dust and cracked, bare clay. The devastation spread out like flood-waters over the plains.\n The sword wasn’t enough. We all knew that. When we stood here – her, me, the priest …\n The priest!\n He whirled round.\n At that moment Quick Ben reached the crest. ‘No one leaves the barrow! Stay inside the ring!’\n The ring? ‘Gods below. D’rek!’\n The wizard heard him and flashed a half-panicked grin. ‘Well said, Fid! But not gods below. Just one.’\n Kalam stumbled into view behind Quick Ben, lathered in sweat and so winded he fell to his knees, face stretched in pain as he struggled to catch his breath.\n Hedge threw the assassin a waterskin. ‘You’re out of shape, soldier.’\n Fiddler saw his marines drawing up – their eyes were on the approaching dragon, and the hundreds of other, smaller dragons swooping down upon it in deadly waves. When some of them saw the blight, spreading out and now rushing closer, they flinched back. Fiddler well understood that gesture. ‘Quick Ben! Can she protect us?’\n The wizard scowled across at him. ‘You don’t know? She’s here, isn’t she? Why else would she be here?’ He then advanced on Fiddler. ‘Didn’t you plan this?’\n ‘Plan? What fucking plan?’ he retorted, unwilling to budge. ‘Banaschar said something … his god was coming – to offer protection—’\n ‘Exactly – wait, what kind of protection?’\n ‘I don’t know!’\n The blight struck the lower ground, caught the scattered Kolansii soldiers. They disintegrated in billows of dust.\n The Malazans threw themselves to the ground, covering their heads.\n Fiddler simply stared, as the Otataral Dragon voiced a terrible cry that seemed to hold in it a world’s pain and anguish, age upon age – and its tattered wings, snapping like torn sails, thundered wildly in the air as the creature halted directly above the barrow. Quick Ben pulled him down to the ground.\n Nearby the earth shook as the corpse of a dragon slammed into it. A curtain of blood slapped the hillside.\n The wizard dragged himself close. ‘Stay low – she’s fighting it. Gods, it’s killing her! ’\n Twisting round on the ground, Fiddler looked over at the Crippled God. His eyes widened.\n Forged by the gods, the chains shattered like ice, links exploding, flinging shards in a vicious hail. Soldiers cried out, flinched away. The Crippled God remained lying on the ground, motionless. He had carried that weight for so long, he felt unable to move.\n Yet his chest filled with air, the unyielding constriction now gone. The sudden release from pain left him hollow inside. Trembling took his body, and he turned his head. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-457.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
