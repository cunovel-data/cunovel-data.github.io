This woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, will challenge the gods - if her own mutinous troops don\u0027t kill her first.

In the realm of Kurald Galain, home to the long lost city of Kharkanas, a refugees commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, await the breaching of Lightfall, and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. In this war they cannot win, they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects. Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon. Against her force of utter devastation, no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying. Soon will come the Eleint, dragons, and a final cataclysm.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10.jpg","author":"Steven Erikson","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":472,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
