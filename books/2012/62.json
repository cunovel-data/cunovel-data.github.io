First one gets here can have this throne and all that goes with it. Husband, start building us a cottage in the woods. Make it remote. No, make it impossible to reach. And tell none but me where it is.’ ‘A cottage.’ ‘Yes. With a drawbridge and a moat, and pitfalls and sprawl-traps.’ ‘I’ll start drawing up plans.’ Yan Tovis said, ‘Queen Sandalath, I beg your leave.’ ‘Yes. Sooner the better.’ The ex-Letherii officer tilted her head, wheeled and strode from the chamber. Captain Brevity stepped forward to face the throne and settled on one knee. ‘Highness, shall I summon the palace staff?’ ‘In here? Abyss take me, no. Start with all the other rooms. Go on. You are, er, dismissed. Husband! Don’t even think of leaving.’ ‘The thought had not even occurred to me.’ And he managed to hold his neutral expression against her withering scepticism. As soon as they were alone, Sandalath sprang from the throne as if she’d just found one of those ancient tacks. ‘That bitch!’ Withal flinched. ‘Yan—’ ‘No, not her – she’s right, the cow. I’m stuck with this, for the moment. Besides, why should she be the only one to suffer the burden of rule, as she so quaintly put it?’ ‘Well, put it that way, and I can see how she might be in need of a friend.’ ‘An equal of sorts, yes. The problem is, I don’t fit. I’m not her equal. I didn’t lead ten thousand people to this realm. I barely got you here.’ He shrugged. ‘But here we are.’ ‘And she knew.’ ‘Who?’ ‘That bitch Tavore. Somehow, she knew this would happen—’ ‘There’s no proof of that, Sand,’ Withal replied. ‘It was Fiddler’s reading, not hers.’ She made a dismissive gesture. ‘Technicalities, Withal. She trapped me is what she did. I should never have been there. No, she knew there was a card waiting for me. There’s no other explanation.’ ‘But that’s no explanation at all, Sand.’ The look she threw him was miserable. ‘You think I don’t know that?’ Withal hesitated. ‘Listen,’ he said, ‘your kin are coming. Are you really certain you want me standing there at your side when they do?’ Her eyes narrowed. ‘What you’re really saying is: do I want to be standing at her side when they arrive? A mere human, a shortlived plaything to the Queen of Darkness. That’s how you think they’ll see you, isn’t it?’ ‘Well …’ ‘You’re wrong. It will be the opposite and that might be just as bad. They’ll see you for what you are: a threat.’ ‘A what ?’ She regarded him archly. ‘Your kind are the inheritors – of everything. And here you are, along with all those Letherii and blood-thin Shake, squatting in Kharkanas. Is there anywhere you damned bastards don’t end up sooner or later? That’s what they’ll be thinking.’ ‘Mael knows, they’ve got a point,’ he said, looking away, down the length of the throne room, imagining a score or more regal Tiste Andii standing there, eyes hard, faces like stone. ‘I’d better leave.’ ‘No you won’t. Mother Dark—’ Abruptly she shut her mouth. He turned his head, studied her. ‘Your goddess is whispering in your ear, Sand? About me?’ ‘You’ll be needed,’ she said, once more eyeing the lone amphora. ‘All of you. The Letherii refugees. The Shake. And it’s not fair. It’s not fair! ’ He took her arm as she moved to assault the crockery. Pulled her round until she was in his arms. Startled, terrified, he held her as she wept. Mael! What awaits us here? But there was no answer, and his god had never felt so far away. Yedan Derryg dragged the tip of the Hust sword, making a line in the crumbled bones of the Shore. The cascading wall of light flowed in reflection along the length of the ancient blade, like tears of milk. ‘We are children here,’ he muttered. Captain Pithy hawked phlegm, stepped forward and spat into the wall, and then turned to face him. ‘Something tells me we’d better grow up fast, Watch.’ Yedan clenched his teeth, chewed on a half-dozen possible responses to her grim observation, before saying, ‘Yes.’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-62.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
