Another pass comes – look—’\\n\\n A dark shape was descending behind Lightfall, a thing huge and blurred. Lunging to sweep past the heart of the wound. Something struck the barrier like a massive fist. Light sprayed like blood. Red cracks spread out from the dark stain.\\n\\n Yedan stood. ‘Go back to the queen of Kharkanas, Withal,’ he said, drawing his sword. ‘One more pass, if that, and then this begins.’\\n\\n ‘Begins?’ Withal asked, as if struck dumb.\\n\\n He saw Pithy and Brevity running up the strand. A sudden chill flooded through him. Terrible memories. Of his younger days, of battles upon the decks of the Meckros. Fear weakened his legs.\\n\\n ‘Tell her,’ continued Yedan, his tone as steady as ever, ‘we will hold as long as we can. Tell her, Withal, that once more the Shake stand upon the Shore.’\\n\\n Spear points thrust out from the wound, a shivering, bristling horror – he could see figures, pushing, crowding, could almost hear their howls. Light spurted like ropes of gore. Light flooded out on to the strand, illuminating the crushed bones. Light lit faces beneath helms.\\n\\n Tiste Liosan. The Children of Father Light. A star is born in the dark, and the heavens are revealed to all .\\n\\n ‘Go, Withal. We are breached.’\\n\\n We can hold against nothing. We can only crumble, like sand before the devouring wave. Yedan calls to his officers, his officers rush and shout, ranks form up, these would-be soldiers struggle and steady themselves. The Shake – my Shake – stand pale, eyes wide, straining to see what’s happening at the breach, where the Letherii, dreaming of riches, meet the thrusting spears .\\n\\n Screams now rise from the wound. There are Tiste Liosan, their faces broken masks of fury, and all the madness of war is down there, at the breach. Life’s blood even now spilling down .\\n\\n We cannot hold. Look at my people, how their eyes track my brother now, but he’s only one man, and even he cannot defeat this enemy. Long ago, there were enough of us, enough to hold, enough to last and to die to save this realm. But no longer .\\n\\n Pully and Skwish loomed in front of her. They were shouting, screaming, but she was deaf to them. The clash of weapons grew desperate, like a thousand knives upon a single whetstone. But you are flesh, my brother. Not a whetstone. Flesh .\\n\\n ‘You must kneel!’\\n\\n Yan Tovis frowned at the young woman before her. ‘Is it blood you want?’\\n\\n Eyes widened.\\n\\n She held out her wrists. ‘This?’\\n\\n ‘You need to kneel before the Shore!’\\n\\n ‘No,’ she growled. ‘Not yet. Go away, I’m done with you. The islanders are fighting – go down to them, kneel yourselves. In the sand beside the wounded and the dying – both of you. Look in their faces, and tell them it was all worth it.’ Yan Tovis lunged forward, pushing them so that they staggered. ‘Go! Tell them!’\\n\\n You want me to kneel? To sanctify all of this? Shall I be yet one more ruler to urge my subjects to their deaths? Shall I stand tall and bold, shouting fierce promises of glory? How many lies can this scene withstand? Just how empty can words be?\\n\\n ‘Kneel,’ she whispered. ‘Yes. Everyone. Kneel .’\\n\\n CHAPTER NINE\\n\\n I am fallen prey\\n\\n There was a time\\n\\n When fangs sank deep\\n\\n My body dragged\\n\\n And flesh howled\\n\\n Fear’s face was cold\\n\\n With instinct’s need\\n\\n There was a time\\n\\n When strangers took me\\n\\n And the unfamiliar\\n\\n Whispered terror\\n\\n And the shock of desires\\n\\n We could not expect\\n\\n Lit eyes so like our own\\n\\n There was a time\\n\\n When a friend twisted\\n\\n Before my eyes\\n\\n And all my solid faiths\\n\\n Washed free underfoot\\n\\n Unknowing the world\\n\\n With new and cruel design\\n\\n There was a time\\n\\n When kin drew the knife\\n\\n To sever sacred law\\n\\n With red envy\\n\\n And red malice\\n\\n The horror visits\\n\\n The heart of home\\n\\n Do you see this journey?\\n\\n What began in shadows\\n\\n And dark distance\\n\\n Has drawn ever closer\\n\\n Now I am fallen prey\\n\\n To the demon in my soul\\n\\n And the face twisting\\n\\n Is my own\\n\\n Railing at failures\\n\\n Of flesh and bone\\n\\n The spirit withers\\n\\n And I fall prey\\n\\n We have listed\\n\\n A world of enemies\\n\\n And now we fall prey\\n\\n We fall prey\\n\\n Faces of Fear Fisher kel Tath\\n\\n BROKEN AT LAST, THE BODY SLUMPS AND THE SPIRIT PULLS FREE, THE spirit wings away in flight and the sound of its wings is a sigh. But this, he knew, was not always the case. There were times when the spirit staggered loose with a howl, as broken as the body left behind. Too long inside tortured flesh, too long a sordid lover of punishing pain. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-117.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
