Icarium frowned and was silent.\n Ublala was ready to turn away when Icarium said, ‘Friend, I have remembered something.’\n EPILOGUE I\n Perched upon the stones of a bridge\n The soldiers had the eyes of ravens\n Their weapons hung black as talons\n Their eyes gloried in the smoke of murder\n To the shock of iron-heeled sticks\n I drew closer in the cripple’s bitter patience\n And before them I finally tottered\n Grasping to capture my elusive breath\n With the cockerel and swift of their knowing\n They watched and waited for me\n ‘I have come,’ said I, ‘from this road’s birth,\n I have come,’ said I, ‘seeking the best in us.’\n The sergeant among them had red in his beard\n Glistening wet as he showed his teeth\n ‘There are few roads on this earth,’ said he,\n ‘that will lead you to the best in us, old one.’\n ‘But you have seen all the tracks of men,’ said I\n ‘And where the mothers and children have fled\n Before your advance. Is there naught among them\n That you might set an old man upon?’\n The surgeon among this rook had bones\n Under her vellum skin like a maker of limbs\n ‘Old one,’ said she, ‘I have dwelt\n In the heat of chests, among heart and lungs,\n And slid like a serpent between muscles,\n Swum the currents of slowing blood,\n And all these roads lead into the darkness\n Where the broken will at last rest.\n ‘Dare say I,’ she went on,‘there is no\n Place waiting inside where you might find\n In slithering exploration of mysteries\n All that you so boldly call the best in us.’\n And then the man with shovel and pick,\n Who could raise fort and berm in a day\n Timbered of thought and measured in all things\n Set the gauge of his eyes upon the sun\n And said, ‘Look not in temples proud,\n Or in the palaces of the rich highborn,\n We have razed each in turn in our time\n To melt gold from icon and shrine\n And of all the treasures weeping in fire\n There was naught but the smile of greed\n And the thick power of possession.\n Know then this: all roads before you\n From the beginning of the ages past\n And those now upon us, yield no clue\n To the secret equations you seek,\n For each was built of bone and blood\n And the backs of the slave did bow\n To the laboured sentence of a life\n In chains of dire need and little worth.\n All that we build one day echoes hollow.’\n ‘Where then, good soldiers, will I\n Ever find all that is best in us?\n If not in flesh or in temple bound\n Or wretched road of cobbled stone?’\n ‘Could we answer you,’ said the sergeant,\n ‘This blood would cease its fatal flow,\n And my surgeon could seal wounds with a touch,\n All labours will ease before temple and road,\n Could we answer you,’ said the sergeant,\n ‘Crows might starve in our company\n And our talons we would cast in bogs\n For the gods to fight over as they will.\n But we have not found in all our years\n The best in us, until this very day.’\n ‘How so?’ asked I, so lost now on the road,\n And said he, ‘Upon this bridge we sat\n Since the dawn’s bleak arrival,\n Our perch of despond so weary and worn,\n And you we watched, at first a speck\n Upon the strife-painted horizon\n So tortured in your tread as to soak our faces\n In the wonder of your will, yet on you came\n Upon two sticks so bowed in weight\n Seeking, say you, the best in us\n And now we have seen in your gift\n The best in us, and were treasures at hand\n We would set them humbly before you,\n A man without feet who walked a road.’\n Now, soldiers with kind words are rare\n Enough, and I welcomed their regard\n As I moved among them, ’cross the bridge\n And onward to the long road beyond\n I travel seeking the best in us\n And one day it shall rise before me\n To bless this journey of mine, and this road\n I began upon long ago shall now end\n Where waits for all the best in us.\n Where Ravens Perch Avas Didion Flicker \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-464.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
