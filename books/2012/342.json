She asked me to die defending her – knowing I didn’t even like her much. Quick, for the rest of my life, I will never forget that moment.’\\n\\n ‘And you still can’t quite work out what happened.’\\n\\n The assassin nodded. ‘All at once, it’s as if she’s somehow laid bare your soul and there it is, exposed, trembling, vulnerable beyond all belief – and she could take it, grasp it tight until the blood starts dripping. She could even stab it right through. But she didn’t – she didn’t do any of that, Quick. She reached down, her finger hovered, and then … gone, as if that was all she needed.’\\n\\n ‘You can stop now,’ the wizard muttered. ‘What you’re talking about – between two people – it almost never happens. Maybe it’s what we all want, but Kalam, it almost never happens.’\\n\\n ‘There was no respect in what Laseen offered,’ the assassin said. ‘It was a raw bribe, reaching for the worst in me. But from Tavore …’\\n\\n ‘Nothing but respect. Now I see it, Kal. I see it.’\\n\\n ‘Quick?’\\n\\n ‘What?’\\n\\n ‘Is she alive? Do you think … is Tavore still alive?’\\n\\n Quick Ben kicked a stone from his path. ‘Even her brother can’t answer that. I just don’t know.’\\n\\n ‘But do you – are you …’\\n\\n ‘Do I have faith? Is that what you’re asking?’ He waved about. ‘Look around! This whole damned army is marching on faith! We just have to get on with it, right?’\\n\\n ‘Fine then,’ Kalam growled. ‘Let me ask you this: can Paran pull it off on his own? If he has to?’\\n\\n Quick Ben rubbed at his face. Scowling, he spoke under his breath. ‘Listen. Have you been paying attention?’\\n\\n ‘To what?’\\n\\n ‘Just … when he walks through camp. Or rides. Do you hear the soldiers – calling up to him as he passes? Jests flying back and forth, laughter and nods, all of it. They’re here because following him is what they need, what they want. The Host lost Dujek Onearm – that should’ve finished them, but it hasn’t, has it? Our old captain here is now leading the whole army. You say Tavore asks because for her that’s what’s needed. But her brother, he just expects .’\\n\\n Kalam slowly nodded. ‘Five coins to that, Quick. Still’ – and he shot the wizard a sharp look – ‘Shadowthrone sent you here, didn’t he?’\\n\\n Quick Ben made a face. ‘The Emperor’s drawing in all the old webs – frankly, I’m appalled how he can still do that, you know? What kind of knots did he tie on to us anyway? Gods below.’\\n\\n ‘Do you trust him?’\\n\\n ‘Shadowthrone? Are you mad?’\\n\\n The assassin paused, shook himself, and said, ‘That’s it, then. Kalam is done with his questions – you, wizard, you cover my back and I’ll do the same for yours. Let’s go and kill Forkrul Assail. Lots of them.’\\n\\n ‘It’s about time you regressed to your usual brainless bear-like self. So, there will be a camp up there, where the officers are all gathered. Well behind the entrenchments. Watered and Pures and whatever. We need to find the Pures first this time – take them out of the way and the rest won’t be as bad.’\\n\\n ‘Right. So what’s all this about me not sheathing my Otataral knife? Why should that be a problem?’\\n\\n Quick Ben shrugged. ‘How does one make Otataral?’\\n\\n ‘No idea.’\\n\\n ‘Of course you haven’t!’ the wizard snapped. ‘You make it by pouring as much magic into one place at one time as you possibly can, and if you’re lucky a threshold is crossed – a firestorm that burns everything out, making—’\\n\\n ‘Otataral.’\\n\\n ‘Will you stop interrupting me? My point is, what happens when ten thousand dragons and a few hundred Elder Gods decide to get together and do the same thing?’\\n\\n ‘Otataral Island? Off Seven Cities? No wonder there’s so much—’\\n\\n ‘Be quiet! No. Not Otataral Island – that was just some localized scrap a million or so years ago. No. What you get, Kalam, is an Otataral Dragon.’\\n\\n ‘Hood take me – wait, don’t tell me they went and did that?’\\n\\n ‘Fine, I won’t. But that’s still not the point, Kalam.’\\n\\n ‘So what is the point, Quick Ben?’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-342.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
