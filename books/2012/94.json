As for the rest, well, “for the rotted flesh, the Worm sings”.’ His laugh was bitter. He stared at Tavore. ‘See her? Look well, all of you. She is the madness of ambition, friends. From beneath the hands of the Forkrul Assail, and those of the gods themselves, she means to steal the Crippled God’s heart.’\\n\\n Queen Abrastal gusted out a breath. ‘My Fourteenth Daughter is even now approaching the South Kingdoms. She is a sorceress of considerable talent. If we are to continue this discussion of tactics, I will seek to open a path to her—’\\n\\n The Adjunct cut in. ‘Highness, this is not your war.’\\n\\n ‘Forgive me, Adjunct Tavore, but I believe it is.’ She turned to her Barghast Warchief. ‘Spax, your warriors hunger for a scrap – what say you?’\\n\\n ‘Where you lead, Highness, the White Face Gilk shall follow.’\\n\\n ‘The Otataral sword I wear—’\\n\\n ‘Forgive me again, Adjunct, but the power my daughter is drawing upon now happens to be Elder. Omtose Phellack.’\\n\\n Tavore blinked. ‘I see.’\\n\\n Brys Beddict then spoke. ‘Mortal Sword Krughava, if you will accept the alliance of Queen Abrastal, will you accept mine?’\\n\\n The grey-haired woman bowed. ‘Prince – and Highness – the Perish are honoured. But …’ she hesitated, then continued, ‘I must tell you all, I shall be harsh company. Knowing what the Bonehunters face … knowing that they will face it alone, as wounded as the very heart they would see freed … ah, my mood is grim indeed, and I do not expect that to change. When at last I strike for the Spire, you will be hard pressed to match my determination.’\\n\\n Brys smiled. ‘A worthy challenge, Mortal Sword.’\\n\\n The Adjunct walked to stand once more before Hanavat. ‘Mother,’ she said, ‘I would ask this of you: will the Khundryl march with the Bonehunters?’\\n\\n Hanavat seemed to struggle finding her voice. ‘Adjunct, we are few.’\\n\\n ‘Nonetheless.’\\n\\n ‘Then … yes, we shall march with you.’\\n\\n Queen Abrastal asked, ‘Adjunct? Shall I call upon Felash, my Fourteenth Daughter? There are matters of tactics and logistics awaiting us this day. By your leave, I—’\\n\\n ‘I am done with this!’ Blistig shouted, turning to leave.\\n\\n ‘Stand where you are, Fist,’ Tavore said in a voice like bared steel.\\n\\n ‘I resign—’\\n\\n ‘I forbid it.’\\n\\n He stared at her, mouth open in shock.\\n\\n ‘Fists Blistig, Kindly and Faradan Sort, our companies need to be readied for tomorrow’s march. I shall call upon you all at dusk to hear reports of our status. Until then, you are dismissed.’\\n\\n Kindly grasped Blistig by one arm and marched him out, Sort following with a wry smile.\\n\\n ‘Omtose Phellack,’ muttered Banaschar once they’d left. ‘Adjunct, I was chilled enough the last time. Will you excuse me?’\\n\\n Tavore nodded. ‘Captain Yil, please escort our priest to his tent, lest he get lost.’ She then shot Aranict a glance, as if to ask Are you ready for this? To which Aranict nodded.\\n\\n Abrastal sighed. ‘Very well, shall we begin?’\\n\\n Aranict saw that the dung had burned down to dull ashes. She flicked away the gutted butt of her last stick, and then stood, lifting her gaze to the Spears of Jade.\\n\\n We’ll do what we can. Today, we promised as much. What we can .\\n\\n One battle. Oh, Tavore …\\n\\n Sick and shaken as she had been, her hardest journey this day had been back through the Bonehunter camp. The soldiers, their faces, the low conversations and the occasional laugh – each and every scene, each and every sound, struck her heart like a dagger’s point. I am looking upon dead men, dead women. They don’t know it yet. They don’t know what’s awaiting them, what she means to do with them .\\n\\n Or maybe they do .\\n\\n Unwitnessed. I’ve heard about this, about what she told them. Unwitnessed … is what happens when nobody survives .\\n\\n He’d intended to call them all together during the Adjunct’s parley, but re-forming the squads had taken longer than he’d thought it would – a notion which, he decided, had been foolishly optimistic. Even with spaces in each campfire’s circle yawning like silent howls, marines and heavies might as well have been rooted to the ground. They’d needed pulling, kicking, dragging out of their old places.\\n\\n To fit into a new thing you had to leave the old thing behind, and that wasn’t as easy as it sounded, since it meant accepting that the old thing was dead, for ever gone, no matter where you tried standing or how stubbornly you held fast. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-94.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
