Reached for Heboric’s .\\n\\n But the mortal stepped back, and said , ‘ Not yet, and not both of them. Both of them will kill you. I will reach for you, Lord, when the moment arrives. This I promise .’\\n\\n The Crippled God bowed, and stepped back .\\n\\n And with his Otataral hand, Heboric, once named Light-Touch, reached through the waters above him. Copper light burst forth, filled the entire cavern .\\n\\n The vast fingers that erupted from the barrow encompassed the entire mound – but they did not tear the ground. Ghostly, translucent, they arced high overhead, and closed about the Otataral Dragon.\\n\\n Korabas loosed a deafening scream – but if it was a cry of pain, torment or release Fiddler could not tell.\\n\\n Beyond the Otataral Dragon, which was even now being drawn closer down above them, the manifestation of T’iam – growing ever more corporeal, forming a multi-headed leviathan – began to tear itself apart once more. Distant shrieks, as dragons pulled away, lunged free.\\n\\n Most fled as if their tails were on fire. Fiddler stared, now unmindful of the vast, descending form of the Otataral Dragon, as they raced away, while others, too badly damaged, spun earthward, striking the ground with thunderous concussions. It’s fucking raining dragons .\\n\\n Quick Ben stared upward, praying under his breath, and then his eyes narrowed – he could see through Korabas. He has her – whoever you are, you have her now .\\n\\n Gods, this is going to work .\\n\\n I promised, Burn. I promised you, didn’t I?\\n\\n All right, so maybe I can’t take all the credit .\\n\\n Maybe .\\n\\n For modesty’s sake, if I ever talk about it, I mean. But here, in my head … I did it!\\n\\n Kalam saw the infernal pride burgeoning in the wizard’s face and knew precisely what the scrawny bastard was thinking. The assassin wanted to hit the man. At least ten times.\\n\\n Crouched, even as the ghostly body of the Otataral Dragon slipped down around them all, Kalam turned to look at the Crippled God. Who stood motionless, eyes shut, hands still raised into the sky.\\n\\n Maybe a dragon can fly you up there, friend. They’re not all fleeing, are they?\\n\\n A woman he’d never seen before slumped down beside him, offered him an inviting smile. ‘I like the look of you,’ she said.\\n\\n Gods, not another one . ‘Who in Hood’s name are you?’\\n\\n Her smile flashed wider. ‘I am the woman who stole the moon. Oh, I see that you don’t believe me, do you?’\\n\\n ‘It’s not that,’ he replied. ‘Fine, you stole it – but then you broke the fucking thing!’\\n\\n Fury lit her face most becomingly. ‘I am Apsal’ara, the Mistress of Thieves!’\\n\\n He grinned at her. ‘Never liked thieves.’ Frustrate them. Works every time .\\n\\n Hearing the exchange, Quick Ben snorted.\\n\\n Kalam, you never learn, do you? Or maybe you just can’t help yourself .\\n\\n The roof of the cavern suddenly glowed white-hot, and Heboric spun to the Crippled God. ‘Now! Open your eyes – you can’t be down here when she arrives. No one can!’\\n\\n The Crippled God turned. He sensed the two Elder Gods were gone.\\n\\n Farewell, Mael of the Seas and K’rul Maker of Warrens .\\n\\n ‘Open your eyes!’\\n\\n And so he did, and in that moment he felt Heboric take his hand.\\n\\n Koryk had dragged himself behind a tilted standing stone, his eyes fixed upon the Crippled God not five paces away. There was a need inside him, unbearable, savage. It wanted to devour him. It wanted to annihilate the world, the one he lived in, the one that had nothing but the thinnest skin between what hid inside and what lay outside.\\n\\n There was no answer. None but the obvious one – the one he dared not look at. If he did, he would have to face his own story – not as some nostalgic bravado, but as the succession of hurts that he was not unique in carrying. And he would see all the scars – the ones he bore, the others he had made on those close to him.\\n\\n He stared at the Crippled God, as if it could somehow save his soul.\\n\\n And the Fallen One opened his eyes – and stared directly into Koryk’s.\\n\\n Jade fire lit a whirling pillar round the god, spinning ever faster, the glow brightening, the air howling.\\n\\n Their gazes were locked together through the emerald flames.\\n\\n And Koryk saw something – there, awakening, a look … a promise .\\n\\n He felt his soul reaching forth – closer … closer – reaching to touch. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-460.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
