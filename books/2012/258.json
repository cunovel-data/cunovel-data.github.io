Adjunct – do not do this. You cannot carry anything more —\n Hearing someone behind them, they both turned.\n A T’lan Imass. Ruthan Gudd grunted. ‘One of our deserters.’\n ‘Nom Kala,’ the apparition replied. ‘Now in the service of the Fallen One, Elder.’\n ‘What do you wish to tell me?’ Tavore asked.\n ‘Adjunct. You must march for another night – you cannot stop here. You cannot give up. One more night.’\n ‘I intend to march for as many nights as we can, Nom Kala.’\n She was silent, as if nonplussed.\n Ruthan Gudd cleared his throat. ‘You don’t want us to give up – we understand that, Nom Kala. We are the Fallen One’s last hope.’\n ‘Your soldiers fail.’\n ‘They’re not interested in worshipping the Crippled God,’ he said. ‘They don’t want to give their lives to a cause they don’t understand. This confusion and reluctance weakens their spirit.’\n ‘Yes, Elder. Thus, there must be one more night of marching.’\n ‘And then?’ the Adjunct demanded. ‘What salvation will find us by tomorrow’s dawn?’\n ‘The Seven of the Dying Fires shall endeavour to awaken Tellann,’ Nom Kala replied. ‘We have begun our preparations for a Ritual of Opening. Once we have created a gate we shall travel through, to a place where there is fresh water. We shall fill the casks once more and return to you. But we need another day.’\n ‘There are but seven of you,’ Ruthan said. ‘In this desert, that is not enough.’\n ‘We shall succeed in this, Elder.’\n Ruthan cocked his head. ‘If you say so.’\n ‘I do. Now, please inform your soldiers. One more march.’\n ‘To reach salvation,’ said the Adjunct.\n ‘Yes.’\n ‘Very well, Nom Kala.’\n The T’lan Imass bowed to them both, turned and then strode back into the camp.\n When she was gone, the Adjunct sighed. ‘In your obviously long life, Captain, did you ever throw dice with a T’lan Imass?’\n ‘No, and I used to think that wisdom on my part.’\n ‘And now?’\n Ruthan Gudd shook his head. ‘They are terrible liars.’\n ‘Still,’ she said under her breath, ‘I appreciate the effort.’\n ‘We don’t need it, Adjunct. To keep us all going – we don’t need it.’\n ‘We don’t?’\n ‘No.’ And he pointed to Badalle and Saddic. ‘I will go among the troops this day, Adjunct, for I have a story to tell. Two children, a sack of toys.’\n She eyed him. ‘These children?’\n He nodded. ‘These children.’\n CHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n Down on the strand where the sea meets the land\n Where fishermen kneel over wounds that won’t heal\n And the water weeps at the end of the day\n In the mirror you walk away\n Among the red trees and the long dead leaves\n The axeman wanders but cannot remember\n And the earth runs like tears and will not stay\n In the mirror you walk away\n In the silent season high on the hill’s bastion\n In the burning rain and the soul’s dark stain\n Where the children lie where they lay\n In the mirror you walk away\n Along the furrows of his heels a long shadow steals\n Down from the altar pulled all the destinies fulfilled\n Tell the tale another god has had his day\n And in the mirror you walk away\n When on the grey fields the troubles fall still\n Another soldier’s cause dies for what never was\n Drifting past the dreams now gone astray\n In the mirror you walk away\n Soiled the sacrament and broken the monument\n Sullied the sculpture and soured the rapture\n Beauty lives but brief its stay\n And in the mirror you walk away\n Gods will give and then take away\n If faith tastes of blood\n drink deep when you pray\n Beauty lives but brief its stay\n And when it all goes away\n and there’s nothing left to save\n In the mirror you walk away\n In the mirror you walk away\n Song of the Last Prayer (in the age of adjudication) Sevul of Kolanse \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-258.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore. This woman with no gifts of magic, deemed plain, unprepossessing, displaying nothing to instill loyalty or confidence, will challenge the gods - if her own mutinous troops don\u0027t kill her first. \n Her enemy, the Forkrul Assail, seek to cleanse the world, to annihilate everything. In the realm of Kurald Galain, home to the long lost city of Kharkanas, a refugees commanded by Yedan Derryg, the Watch, await the breaching of Lightfall, and the coming of the Tiste Liosan. In this war they cannot win, they will die in the name of an empty city and a queen with no subjects. \n Elsewhere, the three Elder Gods, Kilmandaros, Errastas and Sechul Lath, work to shatter the chains binding Korabas, the Otataral Dragon. Against her force of utter devastation, no mortal can stand. At the Gates of Starvald Demelain, the Azath House sealing the portal is dying.
