To deliver our revenge .\\n\\n Warleader Gall sat on his horse, eyes on the heavy infantry pushing past the embattled female Forkrul Assail. Their ranks were disordered, broken by the steep pitch of the hillside on their right, crowding to avoid the hill where fought their commander and the T’lan Imass. Large stones that had long ago rolled down from the summit further slowed their advance.\\n\\n He could see the flank of Malazans turning to ready for the inward attack – but he could also see that the intention of the enemy was to win through to the rear of the defenders.\\n\\n Beside him, Shelemasa said, ‘Warleader – the south flank—’\\n\\n ‘We must choose one or the other,’ Gall cut in. ‘Do you see the ones before us? They cannot hold their lines – but see how, once they are past the Malazans, they will be able to spread out, once more on level ground. They will then form up.’\\n\\n ‘Warleader, the Adjunct—’\\n\\n ‘We cannot help her,’ he said. ‘If there were three thousand of us, yes, we could challenge that flank. But these ones here – at the threshold of open ground – we will meet them there.’ He drew his tulwar, rode out ahead of his pitifully small army, and then wheeled.\\n\\n ‘In the name of Coltaine and the Fall!’\\n\\n He needed say nothing more. Weapons flashed, the horses tossing their heads as they caught the sudden fever of their riders.\\n\\n Gall sawed on his reins, pitching his mount round. The beast reared, hoofs scything in the air.\\n\\n And the Warleader laughed.\\n\\n Faradan Sort had pushed her way to the edge of the flank – once the Kolansii broke through, she would need to be there, to hold her soldiers, to maintain their resolve – but they do not need me. See their faces! The enemy seeks our underbelly and will be met with iron. And I will be there – this battle shall be mine, to the end .\\n\\n And then she heard the sound of horse’s hoofs. Looked up, twisted round – and saw the Khundryl Burned Tears at full charge. Even as the first of the Kolansii spilled out from the narrow passage, the horse-warriors – with Gall in the lead – crashed into them.\\n\\n The impact shook the ground, rippled through bodies all the way to the Malazan ranks.\\n\\n ‘Hold fast!’ Faradan Sort shouted. ‘Now push! Into the enemy! Push! ’\\n\\n The Kolansii advance had been checked – but not for long, she knew. It has to be enough. Now let’s make them pay for that bad footing .\\n\\n The north-facing side of the Malazan phalanx surged forward, Faradan Sort in their midst, and the Kolansii heavy infantry turned to meet them. But they were staggering, stones rolling underfoot, boulders trapping their legs.\\n\\n And the Khundryl were in a frenzy, driving ever deeper into their ranks.\\n\\n Gods! See them fight!\\n\\n Sergeant Ordinary Grey grasped hold of the corporal’s jerkin, pulled him close. ‘Grid Ffan – where’s your squad?’\\n\\n The Falari’s eyes were wild, his face bright red. ‘All around us, you Kartoolii spider bait!’\\n\\n ‘Where’s your sergeant?’\\n\\n ‘Dead! Where’s your fucking squad?’\\n\\n ‘With your sergeant,’ snapped Ordinary Grey. ‘Except for my Semk here …’\\n\\n They were being jostled, ever losing ground. Grid Ffan’s eyes shifted past the sergeant and then widened. ‘Someone sewed up his fucking mouth!’\\n\\n ‘He likes it that way. Now listen – the south flank—’\\n\\n ‘We ain’t got a south flank!’\\n\\n ‘She’s over there – her and that Shadow Dancer and that captain with piss-ice in his beard. The Assail’s finished, but the heavy infantry’s about to fold us up. She named you, Ffan! Just like she named me and Could Howl. You understanding me?’\\n\\n Grid Ffan shifted round. ‘Hare Ravage! Sample! Find the others – we’re pulling out of this press!’\\n\\n The squad’s huge mailed fist turned to the corporal. ‘I barely got a swing in! Been waiting for fucking ever, Corporal!’\\n\\n ‘We’ll get you your Hood-damned fight, you Kanese squid-eater – we’re taking on a whole army of heavies!’\\n\\n ‘How many of us?’ Sample demanded, her blue-tinted skin ashen with dust.\\n\\n Ffan turned back to Ordinary Grey, who answered, ‘Maybe ten.’\\n\\n The Napan’s grin flashed white, and in a sharp, piercing voice, she cried out, ‘Shades, Brutan, Asp, Shipwreck and Gill Slime! With us! Move, damn you all!’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-446.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
