His back creaked as he strained to lift the head into his arms. He faced the direction the Hound had been heading and then, with a running start that spun him round, he heaved the head out into the light.\\n\\n Facing the opposite direction, he set off for the wound.\\n\\n Aparal’s eyes had been on the gate, and he was not alone in seeing the Hound’s severed head sailing out to thump and roll on the ground. Shouts of dismay and horror sounded on all sides.\\n\\n He stared in horror.\\n\\n It cannot be just one man. It cannot!\\n\\n A Hust legion waits for us. Hundreds of the cursed slayers, each one driven mad by their weapons. Nothing will stop them, nothing can defeat them .\\n\\n We cannot win this .\\n\\n Unblinking, he stared at the huge head, the empty eyes, and then he turned to the dying dragon. It had lurched up against the corpse of Iparth Erule. Had bitten into his rotting flank. But now the motions were slowing, losing that frenzied strength. Eldat, please die. Please .\\n\\n ‘Not long now,’ he whispered. Not long now .\\n\\n Waves of sorcery had pursued the Hound back to the wound, Pully and Skwish advancing behind them, clambering over corpses and torn-up soldiers still in the process of dying. Pithy staggered in their wake. She’d taken a slash to her right shoulder and the bleeding wasn’t slowing. Her arm was sheathed in red, with thick threads draining from her fist. Colours were fast fading from the world.\\n\\n She saw Brevity leading a solid wedge of Letherii, coming up from the left flank. Where was the prince?\\n\\n And what was that thunder in the breach?\\n\\n Nearby was the carcass of a Hound, and nearer the breach another one of the horrid, giant beasts, still alive, still kicking where it lay on its side. Soldiers were closing on it, readying their pikes. Killing it was going to take some time.\\n\\n I’m so tired . All at once the strength left her legs and she sat down. Bad cut. A fang? A claw? I can’t remember – can’t twist round enough to see it. But at least the pain’s gone .\\n\\n ‘Captain!’\\n\\n Pithy looked down at the sword in her hand. Smiled. You did all right. You didn’t fail me. Where’s that girl? Need to tell her .\\n\\n ‘Someone get one of the witches! Quickly!’\\n\\n That voice was loud, almost right next to her ear, but it seemed muffled all the same. She saw Brevity running towards her now, but it was hard work, getting over all those bodies, and Pithy wondered if she’d arrive in time.\\n\\n In time for what? Oh. This .\\n\\n She settled, tried lying down, found herself cradled in someone’s arms.\\n\\n ‘Her back’s bitten half off! Where are the witches? ’\\n\\n ‘Spent.’\\n\\n ‘We need—’\\n\\n A roaring sound filling her head, Pithy looked down at her hand, the one holding the sword. She willed it to let go, but it refused. She frowned. But a moment later the frown faded. I understand. I am a soldier. Not a thief. Not a criminal. A soldier. And a soldier never lets go of the sword. Ever. You see it in their eyes .\\n\\n Can you see it in my eyes? I bet you can .\\n\\n It’s true. At last, it’s true. I was a soldier .\\n\\n Brevity was still ten paces away when she saw her friend die. She cried out, sagged down amidst the corpses. Crossing this killing field had been a nightmare, a passage of unrelenting horror. Letherii, Shake, Liosan – bodies were bodies, and death was death, and names didn’t mean shit. She was soaked in what had been spilled, what had been lost. The abattoir reek was thick enough to drown in. She held her head in her hands.\\n\\n Pithy .\\n\\n Remember the scams? How we took ’em for all they had? It was us against the world and gods, it felt good those times we won. It never hurt us, not once, beating ’em at their own game. Sure, they had law on their side, making legal all they stole. But then, they’d made up those laws. That was the only difference between us .\\n\\n We used to hate their greed. But then we got greedy ourselves. Served us right, getting caught .\\n\\n Island life, now that was boring. Until those Malazans showed up. It all started right then, didn’t it? Leading up to here. To now .\\n\\n They sent us tumbling, didn’t they? Fetching us up on the Shore. We could’ve gone off on our own, back into everything we knew and despised. But we didn’t. We stayed with Twilight and the Watch, and they made us captains .\\n\\n And now we fought us a war. You did, Pithy. I’m still fighting it. Still not knowing what any of it means .\\n\\n Ten paces, and I can’t look over at you. I can’t. It’s this distance between us. And while I live, I can’t cross it. Pithy, how could you leave me so alone? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-227.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
