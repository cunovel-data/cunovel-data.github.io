Mortal Sword, from the visions Gu’Rull has given me, I do not think the Grey Helms accept your command.’ Gesler snorted. ‘Pious bores – I’m glad of that, truth be told. Oh, Krughava looked to be capable and all that, but I tell you, all that Wolf-worshipping made me uneasy.’ Noting her raised brow he shrugged and said, ‘Aye, I went and picked my own god of war, so it’s a bit much to be going on about the Perish. The thing is, Kalyth, it makes sense for a soldier to choose a god of war. It doesn’t make sense when a god of war makes soldiers of an entire people. It’s the wrong way round, right? Well, there’s something skewed about it – though I can’t really tell you why I feel that way.’ ‘So they are free to do as they please?’ ‘I suppose so. I don’t know much about this Tanakalian, except that he’d have done well in the Malazan court, if there’s any truth to the story of how he usurped Krughava. People like that, Kalyth, I don’t trust. It’s what got me in so much trouble all those years ago. Anyway, if Tanakalian wants to take his Perish right up the arsehole of the Forkrul Assail, well, he’s welcome to light his own torch and go to it.’ ‘What are your thoughts on the Letherii prince, Mortal Sword?’ ‘Him I like. Aranict, too. Solid people, those two. From what I heard back in Letherii, before his brother took the throne, Brys was some kind of special bodyguard to the Letherii emperor. Unmatched with the sword. That tells me more about him than you think.’ ‘In what way?’ ‘Anyone who has mastered a weapon – truly mastered it – is a humble man or woman. More than that, I know how he thinks, and something of what he sees. The way his brain works. And it seems that making him a prince hasn’t changed him any. So, Kalyth, worry not about the Letherii. Come the day, they’ll be there.’ ‘Leaving only the Bolkando—’ ‘She defers to Brys, I think. She doesn’t want to, but that’s just how it is. Besides,’ Gesler added, ‘she has red hair.’ Kalyth frowned. ‘I don’t understand.’ ‘Me and Stormy, we’re Falari. Plenty of red-haired people in Falar. So, I’ll tell you what Abrastal is like. Deadly temper, glowing-hot iron, but being a mother she’s learned the wisdom of knowing what’s in her control and what isn’t. She doesn’t like it but she lives with it. Likes her sex, too, but prone to jealousy – and all of that bluster, why, it’s all for show. Inside, she’s just looking for a man like me.’ She gasped. ‘But she’s married! And to a king!’ Gesler grinned. ‘Was just seeing if you were still listening, Destriant. Saw your attention drifting there.’ ‘A Hunter found me – you’re closed off and Stormy is sleeping. A rider was seen, out from close to the Perish camp, riding into the Glass Desert.’ ‘Any more detail than that?’ ‘You can see what the Hunter saw, Mortal Sword.’ ‘Right, I can, can’t I?’ He concentrated for a moment, and then swore under his breath. ‘Krughava.’ ‘Where—’ ‘To the Adjunct, I’d wager. But she’ll never make it.’ ‘What should we do?’ Gesler scratched his jaw, and then wheeled round. ‘Stormy! Wake up, you fat bearded ox!’ BOOK FIVE A HAND UPON THE FATES ‘I have had visions of the future, and each and every one of them ends up in the same place. Don’t ask me what it means. I already know. That’s the problem with visions of the future.’ Emperor Kellanved CHAPTER FOURTEEN Where is the meaning in this stride foot following foot? Why must the land crawl so beneath us in our journey? All to take us to the place where we began so long ago Only to find it strange and unknown and unredeemed Who has blazed this trail and how weary must I become Before the rain grows gentle and soft as tears on the brow? Until the valley unfolds into a river the sweet colour of sand And trees ribbon the sky overhead with dusty leaves? How weary must you become as you rattle the chains And drown in the banners of meaning and rueful portent? If I make you share my torment foot following foot Know that this is my curse of the swallowed key","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-196.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
