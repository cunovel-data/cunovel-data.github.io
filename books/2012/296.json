Kadagar stared in horror as it rushed across the strand and slammed into his Liosan legions.\\n\\n Tiste Andii!\\n\\n He wheeled, crooked his wings, awakening the sorcery within him, and sped down towards his hated foes. I will kill them. I will kill them all!\\n\\n Something spun past him in a welter of blood and gore – one of his kin – torn to shreds. Kadagar screamed, twisted his neck and glared upward.\\n\\n To see a red dragon – a true Eleint, twice the size of his kin – close upon a brother Soletaken. Fire poured from it in a savage wave, struck the white dragon. The body exploded in a fireball, torn chunks of meat spinning away trailing smoke. And now, more black dragons sailed down from the sky.\\n\\n He saw two descend on the kin that had been pursuing the lone dragon, saw them crash down on them in a deluge of fangs and claws.\\n\\n The lone hunter below them banked then, and, wings thundering the air, rose towards Kadagar.\\n\\n Against him, she would not last. Too wounded, too weakened – he would destroy her quickly, and then return to aid his kin. This cannot end this way! It must not!\\n\\n Like a fist of stone, something hammered down on him. He shrieked in agony and rage as enormous talons tore ragged furrows deep across his back. Jaws snapped down, crushed one of his wings. Helpless, Kadagar plunged earthward.\\n\\n He struck the strand in a shower of crushed white bone, skidding and then rolling, slamming up against the unyielding wall of Lightfall. The sand pelted down, filling his ragged wounds. Far overhead, the death cries of his kin. A thousand paces away, the battle at the breach. He was alone, hurt, broken.\\n\\n Kadagar sembled. Dragged himself into a sitting position, setting his back to Lightfall, and watched the black dragon that had been rising to meet him now landing thirty paces away, shedding blood like rain.\\n\\n High overhead, the red Eleint killed another of his Soletaken kin – taking hold of it like a small bird, ripping its limbs off, crushing its skull in its massive jaws.\\n\\n Before him, she had sembled, and now she walked towards him.\\n\\n Kadagar closed his eyes. My people. My people . The sound of her boots. He looked up. She had a knife in one hand.\\n\\n ‘My people,’ he said.\\n\\n She showed him a red smile. ‘Your people.’\\n\\n He stared up at her.\\n\\n ‘Give me your name, Liosan.’\\n\\n ‘I am Kadagar Fant, Lord of Light.’\\n\\n ‘Lord of Light.’\\n\\n ‘I call upon the ancient custom of Hostage.’\\n\\n ‘We have no need of hostages. Your army is destroyed, Lord.’\\n\\n ‘I will speak for the Liosan. There shall be peace.’\\n\\n The woman nodded. ‘Yes, there shall be peace. Lord Kadagar Fant, on behalf of the Tiste Andii, welcome to Darkness .’ The knife flashed up towards his eye.\\n\\n A sudden sting of pain and then …\\n\\n Korlat stared down at the dead man, at her knife, pushed to the hilt in his right eye socket, and then she stepped back, turned away.\\n\\n At the breach, her Tiste Andii kin were slaughtering the last of the Liosan. They had driven them back to the wound itself, and when the enemy retreated into the miasma she saw ranks of Andii follow. There would be an end to this. An end .\\n\\n Overhead, Nimander and his kin were descending, along with Prazek. Dathenar had fallen earlier. Korlat had felt her death cry and its howl still echoed in her soul. Silanah remained high overhead, wheeling like a huntress. Not one of the Liosan Soletaken remained.\\n\\n She looked down the strand, eyes narrowing at the motley remnants of the Shake – three, four hundred at the most – now hunched over, slumping, some falling, in a ragged circle surrounding a kneeling figure. Her gaze drifted momentarily from this company of survivors, travelled over the solid carpet of bodies spreading out on all sides. And, slowly, the magnitude of the slaughter, here upon the First Shore, found resolution.\\n\\n Gods below .\\n\\n She set out for those survivors. A woman dripping blood from too many wounds to count, and beneath her feet, in a steady drizzle, crimson rain.\\n\\n Impossibly, the sound was gone, and the silence now surrounding them had thickened. Withal knelt, bent over, struggling to find his breath, but some blow had broken ribs, and he was afraid to move, afraid to inhale too deeply.\\n\\n The half-naked woman settled down beside him, tortured him by leaning against him. ‘Now that was a fight, thief. And for you, maybe not over.’\\n\\n He was having trouble with his eyes – the blood was drying, seeking to close them up. ‘Not over?’\\n\\n ‘If you don’t give that armour back, I will have to kill you.’\\n\\n He reached up, dragged his helm free and let it tumble from his hands. ‘It’s yours. I never want to see it again.’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-296.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
