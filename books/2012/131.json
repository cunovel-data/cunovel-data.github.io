Hood paused, regarding each witness in turn, and then walked towards Equity.\\n\\n ‘ They made you their king ,’ she whispered. ‘They who followed no one chose to follow you . They who refused every war fought your war. And what you did then – what you did—’\\n\\n As he reached her, his desiccated hands caught her. He lifted her from her feet, and then, mouth stretching, he bit into the side of her face. The tusks drove up beneath her cheek bone, burst the eye on that side. In a welter of blood, he tore away half of her face, and then bit a second time, up under the orbitals, the tusks driving into her brain.\\n\\n Equity hung in his grip, feeling her life drain away. Her head felt strangely unbalanced. She seemed to be weeping from only one eye, and from her throat no words were possible. I once dreamed of peace. As a child, I dreamed of —\\n\\n Shurq Elalle stared in horror as the Jaghut flung the corpse away. From his gore-drenched mouth fell fragments of scalp and skull.\\n\\n Then Hood faced them, and in a dry, toneless voice he said, ‘I have never much liked Forkrul Assail.’\\n\\n No one spoke. Felash stood trembling, her face pale as death itself. Beside her, the handmaid had set her hands upon the axes at her belt, but seemed unable to move beyond that futile, diffident gesture.\\n\\n Shurq Elalle gathered herself, and said, ‘You have a singular way of ending a discussion, Jaghut.’\\n\\n The empty pits seemed to find her, somehow, and Hood said, ‘We have no need of allies. Besides, I recently learned a lesson in brevity, Shurq Elalle, which I have taken to heart.’\\n\\n ‘A lesson? Really? Who taught you that? ’\\n\\n The Jaghut looked away, across the water. ‘Ah, my Death Ship. I admit, it was a quaint affectation. Nonetheless, one cannot help but admire its lines.’\\n\\n Princess Felash, Fourteenth Daughter of Bolkando, fell to her knees and was sick in the sand.\\n\\n CHAPTER TEN\\n\\n What is it about this world\\n\\n That so causes you trouble?\\n\\n Why avow in your tone\\n\\n This victim role?\\n\\n And the plaintive hurt\\n\\n Painting your eyes\\n\\n Bemoans a life’s struggle\\n\\n Ever paying a grievous toll\\n\\n We gathered in one place\\n\\n Under the selfsame sun\\n\\n And the bronze woman\\n\\n Holding the basin,\\n\\n Her breasts settled in the bowl,\\n\\n Looked down with pity\\n\\n Or was it contempt?\\n\\n She is a queen of dreams\\n\\n And her gift is yours to take\\n\\n Pity if you choose it\\n\\n Or contempt behind the veil\\n\\n I would have polished those eyes\\n\\n For a better look\\n\\n I would have caressed those roses\\n\\n For a sweeter taste\\n\\n When we drink from the same cup\\n\\n And you make bitter recoil\\n\\n I wonder at the tongue in waiting\\n\\n And your deadening flavours\\n\\n So eager to now despoil\\n\\n What is it about this world\\n\\n That so causes you trouble?\\n\\n What could I say to change\\n\\n Your wounded regard?\\n\\n If my cold kiss must fail\\n\\n And my milk run sour\\n\\n Beneath the temple bell\\n\\n That so blights your reward?\\n\\n Ten thousand hang from trees\\n\\n Their limbs bared roots\\n\\n Starved of hope in the sun\\n\\n And the wood-cutters are long gone\\n\\n Up to where the road gives way\\n\\n To trails in the dust\\n\\n That spiral and curl\\n\\n Like the smoke of fires\\n\\n They are blazing beacons\\n\\n In the desert night.\\n\\n It was said by the lepers\\n\\n Huddled against the hill\\n\\n That a man with no hands\\n\\n Who could stare only\\n\\n As could the blind\\n\\n Upon the horrors of argument\\n\\n Did with one hand gone\\n\\n Reach into the dark sky\\n\\n And with the other too gone\\n\\n He led me home\\n\\n Wood-Cutters Tablets II \u0026 III Hethra of Aren\\n\\n THE EDGE OF THE GLASS DESERT WAS A BROKEN LINE OF CRYSTALS AND boulders, for all the world like an ancient shoreline. Aranict could not pull her gaze from it. She sat slumped in the saddle of her wearily plodding horse, a hood drawn over against the blistering sun, off to one side of the main column. Prince Brys rode somewhere ahead, near the vanguard, leaving her alone.\\n\\n The desert’s vast, flat stretch was blinding, the glare painful and strangely discordant, as if she was witnessing an ongoing crime, the raw lacerations of a curse upon the land itself. Stones melted to glass, shards of crystal jutting like spears, others that grew like bushes, every branch and twig glittering as if made of ice.\\n\\n Rolled up against the verge there were bones, heaped like driftwood. Most were shattered, reduced to splinters, as if whatever had befallen the land had taken in a massive fist each creature and crushed the life from it – it felt like a deliberate act, an exercise in unbelievable malice. She thought she could still taste the evil, could still feel its rotted breath on the wind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-131.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
