Lifted so high to show us the perfection Of our own holy faces but their hands are empty Of bricks and sticks now that they’re grown Is there no faith to scour away the cruelty of children? Will no god shield the crying dog on the stone From his lesser versions caging the helpless And the lame? If we are made as we would be Then the makers are us. And if there stands A god moulding all he is in what we are Then we are that god and the children Beating to death a small dog outside my door Are the small measures of his will considered And in tasting either spat out or consumed In the ecstasy of the omnipotent Children Like Gods Fisher kel Tath THE RAMPS HAD BEEN LAID OUT, THE CREWS SINGING AS THEY HEAVED on the ropes. Columns of black marble, rising in a ring around the glittering mound. The dust in Spindle’s mouth tasted like hope, the ache in his shoulders and lower back felt like the promise of salvation . He had seen her this day and she had been … better. Still a child, really, a sorely used one, and only a bastard would say it had all been for the good. That the finding of faith could only come from terrible suffering. That wisdom was borne on scars. Just a child, dammit, scoured clean of foul addictions, but that look remained, there in her ancient eyes. Knowledge of deadly flavours, a recognition of the self, lying trapped in chains of weakness and desire . She was the Redeemer’s High Priestess. He had taken her in his embrace, and she was the last ever to have known that gift . The digging around the mound had scurried up offerings by the bucketload. T’lan Imass, mostly. Bits of polished bone, shells and amber beads had a way of wandering down the sides of the barrow. The great plaster friezes they were working on in Coral now held those quaint, curious gifts, there in the elaborate borders surrounding the Nine Sacred Scenes . Spindle leaned against the water wagon, awaiting his turn with a battered tin cup in one cracked, calloused hand . He’d been a marine once. A Bridgeburner. He’d trained in military engineering, as much as any Malazan marine had. And now, three months since his return from Darujhistan (and what a mess that had been!) he’d been made a pit captain, but as in his soldiering days he wasn’t one to sit back and let everyone else do all the hard work. No, all of this felt … good. Honest . He’d not had a murderous thought in weeks. Well, days then . The sun was bright, blistering down on the flood plain. On the west road huge wagons were wending up and down from the quarries. And as for the city to the south … he turned, squinted. Glorious light. Kurald Galain was gone. Black Coral was black no longer .","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-147.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
