The one with the watermelon tits and wide eyes. From the coast, yes? Filling your head with all sorts of rubbish.’\\n\\n ‘But—’\\n\\n ‘There’s not a horse in the wide world, Henar, happy to choose a rider. Not one beast eager to serve. Not one is delighted at being broken, its will beaten down. Are they any different from you, or me?’\\n\\n ‘But dogs—’\\n\\n ‘By the Black-Winged Lord, Henar, dogs are bred to be four-legged slaves. Ever seen a wolf smile? Trust me, you don’t want to. Ever. They smile right before they lunge for your throat. Never mind dogs.’ He pointed with his cane. ‘Those animals are wild. They have lived in utter freedom. So, see one you like?’\\n\\n ‘That piebald one, off to the left on its own.’\\n\\n His father grunted. ‘A young stallion. Not yet strong enough to contest the ranks. Not bad, Henar. But I’m … well, surprised. Even from here, one animal stands out. Really stands out. You’re old enough, have been around me enough, too. I would’ve thought you’d see straight off—’\\n\\n ‘I did, Father.’\\n\\n ‘What is it, then? Do you feel you do not deserve the best out there?’\\n\\n ‘Not if it means breaking them.’\\n\\n His father’s head had rocked back then, and he’d laughed. Loud enough to startle the herd.\\n\\n Recalling that moment of his youth, the huge warrior smiled. Remember that day, Father? I bet you do. And if you could see me now. See the woman walking at my side. Why, I can almost hear that beautiful roar of your laughter .\\n\\n One day, Father, I will bring her to you. This wild, free woman. We’ll step on to that long white road, walk between the trees – they must be big by now – and up through the estate gate .\\n\\n I’ll see you standing by the front entrance, like a statue commanding the stone itself. New lines on your face, but that hooked grin still there, in a beard now gone grey. You’re leaning on your cane, and I can smell horses – like a flower’s heady scent on the air, and that scent will tell me that I’ve come home .\\n\\n I’ll see you studying her, noting her height, her lithe confidence, the boldness in her eyes. And you’ll wonder if she’s broken me – not the other way round – you can see that. Not the other way round. But then you’ll look into my eyes, and your smile will broaden .\\n\\n And you’ll tilt back that majestic head. And laugh to the heavens .\\n\\n It will be the sweetest sound in the world. It will be the voice of our triumph. All of us. You, me, her .\\n\\n Father, I do miss you .\\n\\n Lostara’s calloused hand found his own, and he took some of her weight as she leaned one shoulder against him. ‘Bless Brys Beddict,’ she said under her breath.\\n\\n Henar nodded. ‘I suspect a streak of the sentimental in my commander.’\\n\\n ‘Be glad of it. I am.’\\n\\n ‘It was … unexpected.’\\n\\n ‘Why? I fought for you, Henar. Not the Adjunct. You. He understood—’\\n\\n ‘No, not all that, beloved. All … this. Where we have found ourselves. And how we have found each other, for that matter.’\\n\\n She looked up at the Strangers in the night sky. ‘So, he gives us what time there’s left to us. Less sentimental, then, more … pity. You’ve a dour streak, Henar – I think I prefer Brys’s sentimental one. Maybe I’ll get rid of you and ride back to him.’\\n\\n ‘You’d have to fight Aranict for him, I should think.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, you’re right, and I couldn’t do that. Wouldn’t. I like her far too much. Well then, seems I’m saddled with you.’\\n\\n He smiled. Saddled. Hah .\\n\\n ‘Henar.’\\n\\n ‘Yes?’\\n\\n ‘I fear we won’t be coming back from this journey.’\\n\\n He nodded, not because he agreed with her, but because he knew what she feared.\\n\\n ‘We’re going to die,’ she said. ‘In fact, we may not even make it across this desert.’\\n\\n ‘There is that risk.’\\n\\n ‘It’s hardly fair.’\\n\\n ‘I had a maid, once, at the country estate. Watermelon tits and big eyes—’\\n\\n ‘ What? ’\\n\\n ‘My father is terrible with names. So he came up with, er, memorable descriptions. Anyway, she used to tell me stories at night. Long, rambling tales of heroes. Loves lost, loves won. She’d make every ending sweet. To make the night’s dreams the same, you see?’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-169.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
