This invasion had already failed.\n The planks underfoot creaked and bowed slightly and Brother Diligence turned to see that Shield Anvil Tanakalian had arrived on the platform. The man was pale, his face glistening with sweat. He approached the Forkrul Assail as if struggling to stay upright – and Diligence smiled upon imagining the man flinging himself prostrate at his feet. ‘Shield Anvil, how fare your brothers and sisters?’\n Tanakalian wiped sweat from his upper lip. ‘The Bolkando forces possess a mailed fist in the Evertine Legion, Brother Diligence. Commanded by Queen Abrastal herself. And then there are the Gilk Barghast—’\n ‘Barghast? This is your first mention of them.’ Diligence sighed. ‘So they have at last come to the home of their ancient kin, have they? How fitting.’\n ‘They see themselves as shock troops, sir. You will know them by their white-painted faces.’\n Diligence started. ‘White-painted faces?’\n Tanakalian’s eyes narrowed. ‘They call themselves the White Face Barghast, yes.’\n ‘Long ago,’ Diligence said, half in wonder, ‘we created a Barghast army to serve us. They sought to emulate the Forkrul Assail in appearance, electing to bleach the skin of their faces.’\n Frowning, the Shield Anvil shook his head. ‘There was, I believe, some kind of prophecy, guiding them across the seas to land north of Lether. A holy war to be fought, or some such thing. We believe that only the Gilk clan remains.’\n ‘They betrayed us,’ Diligence said, studying Tanakalian. ‘Many Pures died at their hand. Tell me, these Gilk – are they in the habit of wearing armour?’\n ‘Turtle shell, yes – most strange.’\n ‘ Gillankai! Their hands are drenched in the blood of Pures! ’\n Tanakalian backed a step in the face of this sudden fury. Seeing this, Diligence narrowed his gaze on the Shield Anvil. ‘How many warriors among these Gilk?’\n ‘Three thousand, perhaps? Four?’\n Snarling, Diligence turned to face the valley again. ‘The weapons of the Forkrul Assail are our hands and feet – the Gillankai devised an armour to blunt our blows. Shield Anvil, when they come, concentrate against these Barghast. Break them!’\n ‘Sir, I cannot command the presentation of enemy forces. I came here to tell you it is my suspicion that the Evertine Legion will engage the Grey Helms – a clash of heavy infantry. We shall lock jaws with them and we shall prevail. As such, sir, we leave the Gilk, the Saphii and other assorted auxiliaries to your Kolansii. In addition to the Letherii, of course.’\n ‘Any other threats you’ve yet to mention, Brother? ’\n ‘Sir, you vastly outnumber the attackers. I expect we shall make short work of them.’\n ‘And does this disappoint you, Shield Anvil?’\n Tanakalian wiped again at the sweat beading his upper lip. ‘Provided you do not seek to use your voice, sir, to demand surrender, we shall welcome all the blood spilled on this day.’\n ‘Of course. It is the slaughter you so desire. Perhaps I shall indulge you in this. Perhaps not.’\n The Shield Anvil’s eyes flicked away momentarily, and then he bowed. ‘As you will, sir.’\n ‘Best return to your soldiers,’ Diligence said. ‘And keep a watchful eye on that Destriant. She is not what she would like us to believe she is.’\n Tanakalian stiffened, and then bowed again.\n Diligence watched the fool hurry away.\n Watered Hestand thumped up on to the platform and saluted. ‘Blessed Pure, our scouts report the advance of the enemy – they will soon crest the ridge and come into view.’\n ‘Very well.’\n ‘Sir – there are not enough of them.’\n ‘Indeed.’\n As Hestand hesitated, Diligence turned to eye the officer. ‘Your thoughts?’\n ‘Sir, surely their own scouts have assessed our numbers, and the completeness of our defences. Unless they hold some hidden knife or weapon, they cannot hope to best us. Sir …’\n ‘Go on.’\n ‘The High Watered among us have sensed the sudden absence of Brother Serenity, far to the northwest. Clearly, the forces that emerged from the keep are now advancing, and – somehow – they are proving their worth against even the most powerful Pures.’\n ‘Hestand.’\n ‘Sir.’\n ‘This is not the day to fret over distant events, no matter how disquieting they may be.’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-361.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
