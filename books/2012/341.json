They were watching Paran, flanked by a mob of Seven Cities horse-raiders, ride off towards the foot of the raw, worn range of mountains ahead. The assassin drew his cloak tighter over his broad shoulders. ‘Too bad he came to us too late.’ ‘Did he?’ the wizard wondered. ‘If he’d arrived before Pale, he would’ve been down in the tunnels when they collapsed.’ ‘Maybe.’ ‘Why are you walking with me, Kalam? Where’s Minala?’ The assassin’s only answer was a low growl. ‘Well,’ Quick Ben said, ‘it’s just as well that you’re here. We need to work out our next moves.’ ‘Our next what? We’re here to kill Forkrul Assail. There’s no other moves to talk about, and those ones don’t need talking about.’ ‘Listen, that last Pure damn near killed me.’ ‘Rubbish.’ ‘Well, all right. It hurt, then.’ ‘Get over it, wizard. We’re back fighting a real war. Old style. Ugly magic, toe to toe, the works. Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten how to do this.’ ‘I haven’t. But … where’s Fiddler? Hedge? Mallet, Trotts, Whiskeyjack? Where are all the ones we need to cover our backs? Paran’s sending us out into the enemy camp, Kalam. If we get in serious trouble, we’re finished.’ ‘So fix it so that we can get back out if we have to.’ ‘Easy for you to say.’ Sighing, Kalam scratched at the stubble on his jaw, and then said, ‘Something happened, Quick, back in Malaz City. In Mock’s Hold. In that damned chamber with Laseen and the Adjunct. Well, just afterwards. Tavore and me … she asked me to make a choice. Laseen had already offered me whatever I wanted, pretty much. Just to turn away.’ Quick Ben was studying him with narrowed eyes. ‘Everything?’ ‘Everything.’ ‘Knocking Topper off his perch?’ ‘Aye. She was giving me the Claw, even though I had a feeling it was rotten through and through, even then – and I found out the truth of that later that night.’ ‘So something had the Empress desperate.’ ‘Aye.’ ‘Fine. So … what did Tavore offer you instead?’ Kalam shook his head. ‘Damned if I know – and I’ve been thinking about it. A lot. There was a look in her eyes – I don’t know. A need, maybe. She knew that Laseen was going to try to kill her on the way back to the ships. We all knew it.’ ‘She wanted your help – is that so surprising? Who wants to die?’ ‘As simple as that? Quick Ben, she was asking me to die in her place. That’s what she was asking.’ ‘Just as desperate as Laseen, then. The two of them, they asked you to choose between two mirror reflections. Which one was real? Which one was worth serving? You still haven’t explained how Tavore did it.’ ‘She did it the way she seems to get all of us to do what she needs us to do.’ ‘Well now, that’s been the one mystery no one’s been able to answer, hasn’t it? But, just like you, we follow. Kalam, I wish I could have seen you on that night in Malaz City. You must have been the holiest of terrors. So, just like the rest of us, you gave her everything you had. How does she do it?’ ‘She simply asks,’ Kalam said. Quick Ben snorted. ‘That’s it?’ ‘I think so. No offers – no riches, no titles, nothing any of us can see as payment or reward. No, she just looks you straight in the eye, and she asks.’ ‘You just sent a shiver up my spine, Kalam, and I don’t even know why.’ ‘You don’t? More rubbish.’ The wizard waved his hands, ‘Well, Hood knows it ain’t chivalry, is it? She won’t even nudge open that door. No fluttering eyelashes, no demure look or coy glance …’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-341.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
