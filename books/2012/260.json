She said the Wickans have to be sacrificed – and Korbolo Dom. I want that bastard’s knobby head bouncing down every step from Mock’s Hold to the mouth of the sewer – where the fuck are my knives? ’\n Minala drew out a belted brace and flung the gear at his feet. ‘So I come riding through a thousand warrens, nearly get blasted by lightning, and you ain’t got a single word for your Hood-damned wife? ’\n ‘ You threw me out, remember? ’\n ‘ Remember? I’m remembering why, is what I’m remembering. This is all Cotillion’s fault .’\n Quick Ben said, ‘She won’t say it, but she misses you —’\n She rounded on him. ‘You stay out of this! ’\n ‘ I’d love to, but we haven’t got time. Look, Kalam, she’s sincere – she even found you a horse —’\n ‘ What do I need a horse for? We’re in Malaz City! If Laseen’s run away, I don’t need a horse – I need a ship .’\n ‘ Kalam, listen to me. Shadowthrone delivered you to the Deadhouse. You were dying. Poisoned. And then you were just, er, left here. Lying there on the floor. For some time – well, a fair bit of time, in fact .’\n ‘ Did you kill Laseen, then? Did you avenge me? And you have the nerve to call yourself my friend – you didn’t kill her, did you? Did you? ’\n ‘ No I didn’t – just close that trap of yours and try listening for a change. Never mind the Malazan Empire. Never mind the Regent or Protector or whatever title Mallick Rel’s come up with. And maybe Laseen got killed like they say she did, or maybe she didn’t – it doesn’t matter. We’re not hanging around, Kalam. We’re needed elsewhere. Do you understand what I’m saying? ’\n ‘ Not a word. But it sounds to me like we’re wasting time.’ He looked at Minala. ‘So you got me a horse, did you? Is it big enough? Better not be a stallion – you know how they get jealous when I’m around you .’\n ‘ I wasn’t picky,’ she said. ‘But if I’d thought about it, I’d have gotten you a fat one-eared three-legged ass, and you could take turns riding each other. Not that anybody’d tell the difference .’\n ‘ Gods below, you two!’ hissed Quick Ben, with a sharp look out into the yard. ‘Trying to wake up the whole waterfront? We’ve got to go. Now .’\n Kalam collected the weapon belt, checked to confirm that the sheaths held his long knives. But his memory still wasn’t the way it should have been, so he couldn’t be sure. But they looked to be decent weapons anyway. ‘Fine. Shut up the both of you and let’s get going .’\n Outside, beneath a strangely green cloudy night sky, Quick Ben led the way down the winding path between overgrown mounds and dead trees. They reached the gate and the wizard gestured off to their left .\n The horses were tethered to a hitching post in front of a sunken tavern thirty paces away. Rising waters had flooded the taproom, leaving the place abandoned and dark. As they set off for them, Kalam narrowed his gaze on one of the beasts. His steps slowed. ‘Hold on,’ he whispered, ‘that ain’t a horse .’\n ‘ Best I could do,’ Quick Ben muttered. ‘Don’t worry, it’s mine .’\n Four paces from the rail and a hulking, armoured figure stepped out from the tavern’s nearest alley. Two heavy blades clashed together, and then lifted threateningly .\n Quick Ben swore. ‘Look, Temper, I knocked. Nobody home .’\n The visored face swung to study the Deadhouse, and then a deep voice rumbled out. ‘I might have to kill you three anyway .’\n ‘ Why?’ yelped Quick Ben .\n Temper pointed with one of his huge swords. ‘You didn’t close the fucking door .’\n ‘ I’ll be right back .’\n They watched the wizard hurry back to the Deadhouse .\n Temper turned to Kalam. ‘He never fooled me, you know. I don’t know what Whiskeyjack was thinking .’\n ‘ You smell of Coop’s Ale,’ said Kalam. ‘I’m thirsty. Listen, Minala – when Quick gets back, tell him —’\n ‘ Don’t even try,’ she said in a growl. ‘Besides, here he comes .’\n ‘ Done,’ said Quick Ben when he returned. His teeth flashed white as he smiled .\n Temper slid his weapons back into their sheaths. ‘I suppose I don’t really need to say this to any of you. But … don’t come back. We like it sleepy here. I see any of you again …’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-260.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
