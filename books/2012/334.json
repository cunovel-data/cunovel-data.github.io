{"id":102730,"no":334,"title":"Page 334","content":"He saw Setoc standing apart, ignoring the Watered and his officers, ignoring everyone and everything. Was she caught in the grip of the Wolves? Did they stare out now from her mismatched eyes? She is a liability. But it’s not her fault – the Wolves have taken her, they use her – she is nothing more than a portal, and when the gods choose to manifest in this world they will tear right through her. I doubt she will even survive .\n If necessary, I will seal that portal. I will stop the Wolves from coming. I will do this to save their lives .\n So his prayers went unanswered. By her words she had made plain that the priests of the Grey Helms were all fools, self-deluded in believing they could touch the mind of the Wild. And generations of Perish who gave their lives to the Wolves … a waste. All that blood spilled. And the struggles for power, those precious titles of Mortal Sword, Shield Anvil, Destriant, they all meant nothing .\n And therein lurks the cruellest truth of all. In the end, we are no different from every other cult, every other religion. Convincing ourselves of the righteousness of our path. Convincing ourselves that we alone hold to an immutable truth. Secure in the belief that everyone else is damned .\n But it was all a game, the sacred a playground for secular power struggles, venal ambition .\n What’s left to believe in?\n His thoughts swirled, spun in a vortex, taking him down and down … to Krughava. Did you see through it all? Did you decide that personal glory was all there was, the only thing worthy of aspiration? Are you, Krughava, the reduction of the argument?\n Make your last stand. Die neck-deep in integrity and honour and duty – those words are borne on a flag, in three shades of red, and you will rally to that standard and once there you will happily die. Very well, Krughava, I can make sense of you now. It does not help, because still I will not follow you. But at least I understand .\n They didn’t need Setoc. The Grey Helms would be the wrath of the Wolves, the fury of the Wild, but without risk to the Wolves. Yes, this is war, but do not come here. Not to this one. If you do, they will take you. If you do, gods will die on that day .\n I will not have it .\n He realized that he stood between the two – between Krughava and Setoc, between the profane and the sacred, and yet to neither would he give his embrace. Poised on the knife edge indeed. I am the Shield Anvil, and the virtue of blessing is my one and my only virtue, yet here I stand, trapped, unwilling to reach out to either one .\n It seems that the glorious death shall be mine, after all .\n ‘Shield Anvil.’\n He turned, found himself facing the Watered commander. ‘Yes?’\n ‘I suggest you rest and feed for this night. Come the dawn we can begin our march to Blessed Gift—’\n ‘Excuse me, where?’\n ‘Blessed Gift is the old name for the plain where awaits the Kolanse army. It was a land once rich with wheat.’\n Tanakalian smiled, looked away. ‘Very well.’\n ‘Shield Anvil.’\n He glanced back. ‘What is it?’\n The Watered tilted his head. ‘I was about to comment on the impressive courtesy in the manners of your soldiers.’\n ‘Forgive me,’ said Tanakalian, voice tight, ‘I am … distracted.’\n ‘Of course. Brother Diligence wishes to know, are those pursuing you the only threat we should expect?’\n Those pursuing … but I say nothing of the K’Chain Che’Malle. Not to you, not to any of you . ‘I believe so. However …’\n ‘Shield Anvil?’\n ‘There was an army of foreigners – but they attempted to cross the Glass Desert. It is probably safe to assume that they have failed.’\n ‘I agree. We have sensed nothing impinging upon us from that direction.’\n Tanakalian nodded. ‘Well, I doubt you would have anyway, but it pleases me to hear your certainty in your assessment that the Glass Desert cannot be crossed.’\n ‘A moment, Shield Anvil – you say to me that you do not think we would sense their appearance. Why is that?’\n Tanakalian’s eyes wandered past, settled once more on Setoc. He shrugged. ‘Their commander wields an Otataral sword. Not that it could save—’ He stopped then, for the Watered was marching back to his entourage, shouting commands in the Kolansii language. In moments, three riders wheeled their mounts and set out at a gallop northward.\n When he glanced back at Setoc, he found her staring at him.\n The Shield Anvil realized that he was sweating, his heart beating fast in his chest. ‘It’s just an Otataral sword,’ he muttered, baffled at the Watered’s obvious alarm, unnerved by Setoc’s sudden attention. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-334.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
