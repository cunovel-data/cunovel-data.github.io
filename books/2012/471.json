The rider paused on the road, glancing down at the untended turnips growing wild in the ditch, and after a moment he kicked his horse onward. The sun was warm on his face as he rode west along Itko Kan’s coastal track. In his wake, in the lengthening shadows, two figures took form. Moments later huge hounds appeared. One bent to sniff at the turnips, and then turned away. The figure with the cane sighed. ‘Satisfied?’ The other one nodded. ‘And you imagine only the best now, don’t you?’ ‘I see no reason why not.’ Shadowthrone snorted. ‘You wouldn’t.’ Cotillion glanced over at him. ‘Why not, then?’ ‘Old friend, what is this? Do you still hold to a belief in hope?’ ‘Do I believe in hope? I do.’ ‘And faith?’ ‘And faith. Yes. I believe in faith.’ Neither spoke for a time, and then Shadowthrone looked over at the Hounds, and cocked his head. ‘Hungry, are we?’ Bestial heads lifted, eyes fixing on him. ‘Don’t even think it, Ammeanas!’ ‘Why not? Remind that fop on the throne who’s really running this game!’ ‘Not yet.’ ‘Where is your impatience? Your desire for vengeance? What sort of Patron of Assassins are you?’ Cotillion nodded down the road. ‘Leave them alone. Not here, not now.’ Shadowthrone sighed a second time. ‘Misery guts.’ The shadows dissolved, and a moment later were gone, leaving nothing but an empty road. The sun set, dusk closing in. He’d yet to pass any traffic on this day and that was a little troubling, but he rode on. Having never been this way before, he almost missed the side track leading down to the settlement on the shelf of land above a crescent beach, but he caught the smell of woodsmoke in time to slow up his mount. The beast carefully picked its way down the narrow path. Reaching the bottom, now in darkness, he reined in. Before him was a small fishing village, though it looked mostly abandoned. He saw a cottage nearby, stone-walled and thatch-roofed, with a stone chimney from which smoke drifted in a thin grey stream. An area of land had been cleared above and behind it where vegetables had been planted, and working still in the growing gloom was a lone figure. Crokus dismounted, hobbled the horse outside an abandoned shack to his left, and made his way forward. It should not have taken long, yet by the time he reached the verge of the garden the moon overhead was bright, its effervescent light glistening along her limbs, the sheen of her black hair like silk as she bent to gather up her tools. He stepped between rows of bushy plants. And she turned. Watched him walk up to her. Crokus took her face in his hands, studied her dark eyes. ‘I never liked that story,’ he said. ‘Which one?’ she asked. ‘The lover … lost on the moon, tending her garden alone.’ ‘It’s not quite like that, the story I mean.’ He shrugged. ‘It’s what I remember from it. That, and the look in your eyes when you told it to me. I was reminded of that look a moment ago.’ ‘And now?’ ‘I think,’ he said, ‘the sadness just went away, Apsalar.’ ‘I think,’ she replied, ‘you are right.’ The boy watched the old man come down to the pier as he did almost every day whenever the boy happened to be lingering along the waterfront at around this time, when the morning was stretching towards noon and all the fish were asleep. Day after day, he’d seen the old man carrying that silly bucket with the rope tied to the handle for the fish he never caught – and the fishing rod in his other hand would most likely snap in half at a crab’s tug. Bored, as he was every day, the boy ambled down to stand on the edge of the pier, to look out on the few ships that bothered sheltering in the harbour of Malaz City. So he could dream of the worlds beyond, where things exciting and magical happened and heroes won the day and villains bled out in the dirt. He knew he was nobody yet. Not old enough for anything. Trapped here where nothing ever happened and never would. But one day he would face the whole world and, why, they’d all know his face, they would. He glanced over to where the old man was sitting down, legs over the edge, working bait on to the hook. ‘You won’t never catch nothing,’ the boy said, idly pulling at a rusty mooring ring. ‘You sleep in too late, every day.’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-471.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
