Behind her was a mass of bone chains heaped over something that pulsed with carmine light. The heart of the Crippled God.\\n\\n ‘Where is your sword?’ the Forkrul Assail demanded. ‘Or do you think you can best me with just your hands?’\\n\\n My hands . ‘I broke a man’s nose once,’ Gesler said, advancing on her.\\n\\n She sneered. ‘It is too late, human. Your god’s death assured that – it was your god, wasn’t it? By your own prayers you summoned it – to its execution. By your own prayers you lost your war, human. How does that feel? Should you not kneel before me?’\\n\\n Her words had slowed him, then halted him still three paces from her. He could feel the last remnants of his strength draining away. There is no magic in her voice, none we would call so, anyway. No, the only power in her voice resides in the truth she speaks .\\n\\n I killed Fener .\\n\\n ‘When this day began,’ continued the Forkrul Assail, ‘I was an old woman, frail and bent. You could have pushed me over with a nudge then – look at you, after all. A soldier. A veteran of many battles, many wars. I know this not by the scars you bear, but by the endless losses in your eyes.’\\n\\n Losses. Yes. So many losses .\\n\\n The woman gestured behind her. ‘There can be an end to the pain, soldier, if you so desire. I can grant you that … sip.’\\n\\n ‘I – I need a way out,’ said Gesler.\\n\\n She nodded. ‘I understand, soldier. Shall I give it to you? That way out?’\\n\\n ‘Yes.’\\n\\n She cocked her head, her forehead seeming to flinch inward momentarily, as if about to vertically fold in half. ‘I sense no duplicity in you – that is good. I am indeed become your salvation.’\\n\\n ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘Lead me from here, Pure.’\\n\\n She raised one bony, long-fingered hand, reaching for his brow.\\n\\n His fist was a blur. It smashed into her face. Bones snapped.\\n\\n The Fokrul Assail reeled back, breath spraying from a crushed nose – and that fold dividing her face was deeply creased. Shaking her head, she straightened.\\n\\n Gesler knew he was fast – but she was faster. She blocked his second punch and countered. The blow broke his left shoulder, threw him six paces back. He landed hard, skidded and then rolled on to his broken shoulder – the agony that ripped through him took with it all of his strength, his will. Stunned, helpless, he heard her advance.\\n\\n A strange skittering sound, and then the sound of two bodies colliding.\\n\\n He heard her stumble. Heard bestial snarling.\\n\\n Gesler forced himself on to his side. Looked across.\\n\\n Bent had struck the Forkrul Assail from one side, with enough force to drive her to one knee. The cattledog’s jaws had closed on the side of her face, its canines tearing through flesh and bone. One eye was already gone, a cheekbone pulled away – spat out and lying on the blood-stained stone.\\n\\n He saw her reach round, even as she staggered upright, and one hand closed on Bent’s throat. She dragged the beast from the ruin of her face.\\n\\n The cattledog, held out at the end of that long, muscled arm, struggled desperately in her choking grip.\\n\\n No .\\n\\n Somehow Gesler found his feet. And then he was rushing her.\\n\\n Her lone eye locked with his glare and she smiled.\\n\\n He saw her flexing her free arm – drawing it back to await him. He could block that blow – he could try to take her down – but Bent was dying. She was crushing his throat. No . In a flash, he saw a battlefield filled with corpses, saw Truth dragging a limp dog free of the bodies. He heard the lad’s shout of surprise – and then that look in his eyes. So hopeful. So … young.\\n\\n No!\\n\\n Ignoring her fist, even as it shot out for his head, Gesler sent his own blow – not into her face, but into the shoulder of the arm holding the dog.\\n\\n The hardest punch he ever threw.\\n\\n Crushing impacts, and then—\\n\\n The soldier’s punch spun Reverence round, the stunning power behind it shattering her shoulder, even as her own blow connected with his forehead, splitting it, snapping his head back and breaking the vertebrae of his neck.\\n\\n He was dead before he struck the ground.\\n\\n But her right arm was useless, and she sagged to one knee as the dog pulled itself free of her numbed hand.\\n\\n No matter. I will kill it next. A moment – to push past this pain – to clear my thoughts .\\n\\n Bent kicked free, stumbled away. Air filled his lungs. Life flooded back into him. In his mind, a red mist, yearning need, and nothing else. Head lifting, the beast turned back to his master’s enemy . \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-405.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
