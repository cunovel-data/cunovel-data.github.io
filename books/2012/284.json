We see your grief, though we do not yet understand its meaning. What pact have you made with Silanah? Why does she lay waste to all the land? Why does she drive ever closer to proud Kharkanas?’ ‘Proud?’ The word was a sneer. ‘I am now one ghost among many, and it is only ghosts who belong here. If we are to be forgotten, the city must fall. If we are to be forgiven, the city must swallow our crimes. If we are to be dust, the city must be ash. That is how to end this.’ ‘We have journeyed long, Highness. From the Outer Marches, on a hundred hidden paths only a thief would remember. And then the violence took our leaders. The blood of Eleint .’ ‘Cursed blood!’ ‘Highness?’ ‘No! It poisoned me once – you know that, Spinnock Durav! You were there!’ He bowed his head still further. ‘I saw what was done, yes. I saw what you sought to hide away.’ ‘I did not ask them to come back. I didn’t!’ He lifted his gaze, tilted his head. ‘I sense … this is important. Highness. Who did you not ask to come back? ’ Hard, cold hands closed on her face. She felt them like her own, felt the long fingers like prison bars, smelled the wax of melted candles. ‘Can’t you hear it?’ ‘Hear what, Highness?’ ‘Their screams. The dying! Can’t you hear it? ’ ‘Highness, there is a distant roar. Lightfall—’ ‘ Lightfall! ’ Her eyes widened but she could not speak, could not think. ‘What is happening?’ he demanded. What is happening? Everything is happening! ‘Are they in disarray? Your troops?’ He shook his head. ‘No, Highness. They wait on Blind Gallan’s Road.’ Blind Gallan’s Road? There was no such road. Not then. Not when Spinnock Durav came to kneel before his lord. I have lost my mind . A sudden whimper, and she shrank back in the throne. ‘Take off that mask, Spinnock Durav. You were never so old.’ ‘Who did you ask not to come back?’ She licked her lips. ‘She should have taken the throne. She was a true queen, you see. Of the Shake. And the Letherii, the ones she saved. I don’t belong here – I told them—’ But Spinnock Durav was on his feet, a growing horror on his face. ‘Highness! Sandalath Drukorlat! What is that roar?’ She stared at him. Moved her mouth to make words. Failed. Tried a second time. ‘The breach. They’ve come again – tell Anomander – tell him! No one can stop them but him! The Shake – dying . Oh, Mother bless us. DYING!’ Her shriek echoed in the vast room. But he was already leaving. Out in the corridor now, shouting orders – but that voice, too desperate, too frantic. Not like Spinnock Durav at all. Lord Nimander Golit Anomandaris, firstborn of the fraught union of Son of Darkness and the First Daughter of Draconus, fell to his knees. His body trembled as he struggled against the blood of the Eleint and its terrible need, its inescapable necessity . Where was Skintick? Desra? Nenanda? The stones of the river bed crunched beside him, and he felt hands clutch his shoulders. ‘ Resist this, Lord. We’re the last two left. Resist the call of the Eleint! ’ He lifted his head, baffled, and stared into Korlat’s ancient eyes. ‘What – who?’ ‘She has commanded Silanah. She has summoned the Warren of Fire, and set upon the dragon the madness of her desire – do you understand? She would burn this realm to the ground! ’ Gasping, he shook his head. ‘Who sits upon the throne? Who would do this in Mother Dark’s name?’ ‘Can you not smell the blood? Nimander? There is war – here – I don’t know who. But souls are falling, in appalling numbers. And on the Throne of Darkness sits a queen – a queen in despair .’ He blinked. A queen? ‘Where is Apsal’ara?’","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-284.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
