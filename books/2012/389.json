No, we’ll move past the whole mess and come up behind the Perish, and then move forward.’\\n\\n ‘But I want to kill the mixed-blood!’\\n\\n ‘Maybe you’ll get a chance at that—’\\n\\n ‘No! I want to kill him right away! It’s important!’\\n\\n ‘Fine! You can lead a counter-attack once we’re up there, all right?’\\n\\n Gillimada smiled broadly, her teeth even and white as snow. ‘And we will cut down every tree we see!’\\n\\n He glared at her back as she loped ahead. His heart felt ready to burst and he wondered if it might, the moment he stepped up to fight – a sudden clenching in his chest, or whatever happened when the thing seized up. He was certain that it’d hurt. Probably a lot.\\n\\n Glancing upslope to his left, he saw rising dust, and there – the flash of spears or perhaps pikes, or even swords. Ahead, the Teblor raised a shout – and Spax squinted to see bodies sliding down the slope, limbs flailing, weapons skirling away.\\n\\n ‘Go past! Go past!’\\n\\n His warriors were pressing up behind him. Spax snarled. ‘Go round me then, damn you all! I’ll catch up!’ They poured past on either side in a clatter of armour and drawn weapons.\\n\\n My beloved fools, all of you .\\n\\n Forty more heaving paces, another ten, five, and then, looking up, he saw his Barghast scrambling in the wake of the Teblor, up the valley side, many of them using their hands where they could. And above them the Perish falling back, spinning away from blows, tumbling and skidding down into the midst of the climbing warriors.\\n\\n Gods curse us all!\\n\\n ‘Climb! Get up there!’\\n\\n He saw the Teblor reach the summit, saw them plunge forward and out of sight, weapons swinging. And then, behind them, the first of the Gilk, armour grey with dust, their white faces running with stained sweat.\\n\\n Spax reached the base, clambered upward. His legs were half numb under him. Blisters roared with pain on his ankles, his heels. He coughed out dust, was almost knocked over by a descending corpse – a Perish, most of his face cut away – and struggled yet higher.\\n\\n Is there no end to this damned hillside?\\n\\n And then a hand reached down, took hold of his wrist, and Spax was dragged on to level ground.\\n\\n They were in the midst of farm buildings, and the Kolansii were on all sides, sweeping down from the road, driving the buckling clumps of Perish back towards the valley edge.\\n\\n His first sight of this told him that the Grey Helms had been flanked, and though they fought on, with a ferocity worthy of their gods, they were dying by the score. His Gilk had slammed into this press, but even as they did so more Kolansii surged forward, fully encircling the defenders – with the valley side the only possible retreat.\\n\\n Dark fury raged in Spax as he staggered forward, readying his weapons. We failed, Firehair. May all the swamp gods rot in Hood’s own bog! We should have set out earlier – we should have marched with the Perish!\\n\\n The Teblor had formed a solid square and were pushing through the enemy, but even they were not enough.\\n\\n On the road, Spax could see massive elements of the Kolansii army simply driving forward, eastward, ignoring the vicious last stand on their right.\\n\\n We didn’t even slow them down .\\n\\n ‘Withdraw! Barghast! Perish! Teblor! Withdraw – down the hillside! Back down the hillside!’\\n\\n Seeing warrior and soldier stumbling back, seeing them twist and pour down from the summit, the Warchief’s heart felt cold, buried in ashes. Gesler, ’ware your flank. We couldn’t hold them. We just couldn’t .\\n\\n The press of retreating warriors, bloodied and desperate, gathered him up and they all slid ragged paths back down the slope. He was pulled along unresisting. All this way – for this? We could have done more . But he knew that any stand would have been doomed – there were just too many Kolansii, and they fought with demonic valour.\\n\\n He had lost both his weapons on the descent, and his soul howled at the appropriateness of that. Tilting his head back, he stared up at the sun.\\n\\n It was barely noon.\\n\\n In the depths of night rain was pouring down in Darujhistan. Karsa Orlong had walked into the city, and now he stood, water streaming from him, waiting. Opposite him was the temple, and the vow that he had made so long ago now, in the savage intensity of youth, was a heat in his flesh, so fierce that he thought he could see steam rising from his limbs . \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-389.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
