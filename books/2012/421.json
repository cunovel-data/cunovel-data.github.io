Nobody’s ever as forthcoming on these things as one might like. Did they know what was hidden in Kolanse? Probably. Are they interested in … liberation?’\n ‘Hardly,’ growled Faradan Sort, one hand now on the sword belted at her side.\n Ruthan Gudd’s eyes flicked down to that weapon and his smile was wry when he lifted his gaze to Faradan’s. ‘I suspected you had a sound reason for forswearing the Wall.’\n ‘I fought three links from Greymane.’\n Ruthan Gudd nodded but said nothing more.\n Breath hissed from Lostara Yil. ‘This isn’t fair. Ruthan – do you fear using what the Stormriders gave you?’\n ‘The Stormriders are not a people given to compromise,’ Banaschar said, when it was clear that Ruthan Gudd had no intention of replying. ‘The captain senses the ambivalence in what is to come. And the risk of failure. He anticipates that the power of the Stormriders will, if unleashed, conclude that said risk is too great – with too much to lose should the Adjunct’s plan fail.’\n Lostara said, ‘Ruthan – do you not control that power?’\n Finally, the man scowled and said, ‘Ask that of yourself and the Shadow Dance, Lostara Yil.’\n ‘But that is the will of a god!’\n ‘And whom do the Stormriders serve? Does anyone even know? You, Faradan? Are they mindless, senseless creatures? You have stood the Wall. Tell her – tell her what you have seen with your own eyes.’\n ‘They have purpose,’ she said slowly. ‘They are driven. More than that, I cannot say.’\n ‘This is getting us nowhere,’ said Raband. ‘The fact is this: you and me, Skanarow, we’re in command of our companies. Is there anything more that you and I need know? Then I suggest we head back to our troops and leave the rest of their discussion to our superiors.’\n Banaschar watched him dragging Skanarow away by one arm – she threw a look back at Ruthan Gudd but he either did not notice or chose not to, and so did not see the crushing grief take her face.\n Sighing, Faradan Sort drew her gauntlets from her belt. ‘Fare you well, captains.’\n The priest looked up at the morning sky, squinted at the Jade Strangers. Never been closer. We only have a day or two. Not more, surely .\n ‘Cotillion swore to me that he would never again take possession,’ said Lostara Yil.\n Banaschar shot her a searching look. ‘Too tempting, I imagine?’\n ‘What’s given and what’s taken away, Priest.’\n He nodded, understanding her meaning.\n ‘I was expecting to survive all of this,’ said Ruthan Gudd. ‘Now I am not so sure.’\n ‘So you know how the rest of us feel,’ snapped Lostara Yil.\n But the man simply turned to Banaschar. ‘If you will not be with her, Priest, then where will you be? What is your reason for being here?’\n ‘There is a question that has been haunting me,’ he replied over the sound of the first horns announcing column formation. ‘How does a mortal win over a god? Has it ever happened before, even? Has the old order been overturned? Or is this just … special circumstance? A moment unique in all of history?’\n ‘You have won the Worm of Autumn to her cause, Priest?’\n At Lostara’s question, Banaschar frowned. He studied her for a moment, and then glanced at Ruthan Gudd. ‘You look shocked,’ he said to him. ‘Is it that I somehow possessed that power? Or is it the very idea that what we do in this mortal world – with our lives, with our will – could make a god kneel before us?’ Then he shook his head. ‘But you both misunderstood me. I was not speaking of myself at all. I cannot win over a god, even when I am the last priest in that god’s House. Don’t you understand? It’s her. She did it . Not me.’\n ‘She spoke to your god?’\n Banaschar grunted. ‘No, Lostara. She rarely speaks at all – you of all people should know that by now. No. Instead, she simply refused to waver from her path, and by that alone she has humbled the gods. Do you understand me? Humbled them.’\n Ruthan Gudd shook his head. ‘The gods are too arrogant to ever be humbled.’ \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-421.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: \n The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
