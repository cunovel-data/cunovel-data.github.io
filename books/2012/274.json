There was no flaw in Onos Toolan, who was raised in Taur’s place. Indeed, if certain rumours are to be believed, that warrior is older than our gods, and of his prowess with that flint sword I have no doubt at all. No, he accepted the title out of love – for Humbrall’s only daughter. He possessed nothing of the zeal the younger warriors so desired in their warleader. His eyes did not shine with glory, and his voice – no matter how wise the words – held nothing of fire.’\\n\\n ‘In short, he was no politician.’\\n\\n Spax grimaced. ‘You’d think tribes beaten down by centuries of defeat, clans rotted with feuds and mutual hatreds, you’d think, wouldn’t you, that we’d listen to measured wisdom – that we’d heed his warnings against self-destruction.’\\n\\n ‘And if Humbrall Taur had not drowned—’\\n\\n ‘Even Taur was barely holding the clans together. I cannot even say for certain that his drowning was an accident – I was not witness to it. In any case, we Gilk saw nothing evil in Onos Toolan, only in what was likely to be done to him. Among the Barghast, Firehair, a leader is not simply ousted, cast adrift. He is killed. And so too his family – his entire bloodline is slaughtered. We Gilk would not be party to that.’\\n\\n ‘And did you warn Onos Toolan before you left?’\\n\\n ‘No, for it is possible that he would have sought our support in the power struggle to come. And, had he asked, well, how could I have looked him in the eye and refused? It’s my thought now that he would not have asked. But even then, it’s likely I would have offered nonetheless.’\\n\\n She was frowning at him thoughtfully. ‘You chose the coward’s path.’\\n\\n ‘Perhaps you see it that way. Perhaps many did, and still do. But what I did, I did to save my people. And this only Onos Toolan understood – for he did not pursue me, even when he had his chance.’\\n\\n ‘And now, perhaps alone among all the White Face Barghast, you have found that final war to fight, in the name of your bog gods.’\\n\\n He sighed. ‘And nightly I pray that when the battle begins, Onos Toolan will be there. To lead the Barghast.’\\n\\n ‘But it is not to be, Spax.’\\n\\n ‘I know, Highness. I know. And the Gilk shall stand alone, the last clan, the last of the White Faces.’\\n\\n ‘Will you call upon your gods, Spax, upon the charge?’\\n\\n ‘I doubt it.’\\n\\n ‘Then, what shall you do? To inspire your warriors?’\\n\\n He shrugged loose the tension in his shoulders, felt weariness draining in behind it. ‘I believe, Highness, I shall shame them .’\\n\\n As Faint swung herself astride the gaunt horse, she glanced back to see the ghost of Sweetest Sufferance standing at the edge of the camp. A shiver whispered through her, and she looked across to Precious Thimble. ‘Tell me you don’t see her.’\\n\\n ‘I don’t see her, Faint. Let’s go, else we lose them in the dark.’\\n\\n They set off at a canter. Overhead, heavy clouds obscured the Jade Strangers, enough to mute the green glow that had haunted every night for what seemed to be months, if not years. ‘Typical, isn’t it? The one night we could do with that ghoulish light.’\\n\\n ‘Are they rain clouds? That’s what I want to know. Are they, Faint?’\\n\\n ‘What am I, a weather scrier? I don’t know. But I don’t smell rain. I smell … dust.’\\n\\n ‘Thanks,’ snapped Precious Thimble.\\n\\n Faint could just make out the two riders ahead. Brys and Aranict. A K’ell Hunter had arrived with dusk, delivering a message scratched on a wax tablet, and now they were riding to the Che’Malle encampment. Aranict’s invitation had come as a surprise, but Faint was eager to see these huge lizard warriors who’d be fighting at their side. Fighting – well, not us shareholders – we’re just along for the ride, yee hah. But a good look at the Letherii allies just might put me at ease. At least there’s one army that isn’t starving and half dying of thirst. Or so I’ve heard .\\n\\n But for all their complaining, and Hood knows there’s been plenty of it, seems no one can get too heated up about it. Not with that Malazan army trying to cross a real desert. No matter how bad we’ve got it …\\n\\n ‘I still hate horses,’ Precious Thimble said beside her.\\n\\n ‘You’ve got to roll with the animal under you, girl. Just think about making love.’\\n\\n ‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-274.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
