{"id":102624,"no":225,"title":"Page 225","content":"The blunted, battered tip of the sword caught the Hound in the corner of its left eye. With an almost human scream, the beast lurched away, sending figures sprawling. It was scored with slashes from countless pike-thrusts, white hide streaming crimson, and more soldiers pressed in, pursuing. The Hound stumbled over a corpse, twisted round to face its attackers.\\n\\n Its left eye was filled with blood.\\n\\n Got you, you heap of dung!\\n\\n Someone leapt close, swinging a wood-cutter’s axe. The impact on the beast’s skull drove it to its knees. The axe handle shattered, and Pithy saw the wedge blade fall away. The Hound’s skull gleamed, exposed across half its head, a torn flap of skin dangling down past its jaw.\\n\\n One-handed Nithe flung the broken handle away, reached for a knife.\\n\\n The Hound snapped out, jaws hammering into the man. Canines punched through chain, tore deep into his chest. As they ripped free, Nithe’s ribs seemed to explode outward in their wake. He spun, landed on his knees.\\n\\n Pithy shrieked.\\n\\n The Hound’s second bite tore Nithe’s face off – forehead, cheekbones, his upper jaw. His mandible dropped down, hanging like a bloody collar. Both his eyes were gone. He pitched forward.\\n\\n Weaving drunkenly now, the Hound stumbled back. Behind it, Liosan warriors advanced in a bristling line, faces lit with desire.\\n\\n ‘ Drive them back! ’ Pithy screamed.\\n\\n Pikes levelled, her Letherii pushed forward.\\n\\n ‘ The queen! The queen! ’\\n\\n Shake warriors suddenly surrounded Yan Tovis. She heard the Hound somewhere behind her, snarls, weapons striking, shafts shattering, terrible cries of pain – a knot of madness tearing ever deeper through the ranks. But protecting her now, a score of her people, forming up to face the Liosan soldiers.\\n\\n To defend their queen. No, please – don’t do this —\\n\\n There weren’t enough of them. They would die for nothing.\\n\\n The Liosan arrived like the crest of a wave, and in moments rushed round to isolate Yan Tovis and her warriors.\\n\\n Someone crouched to hand her a sword.\\n\\n Her throat thick with nausea, she forced herself to her feet.\\n\\n Seeing the Hound charging for his line on the left flank, Yedan Derryg ran to meet it. The Hust sword loosed a manic, ululating cry, and it seemed that the chilling sound checked the beast – for the briefest of instants – before it launched itself at the prince.\\n\\n When its jaws reached for him, the head was driving down, anticipating that he would come in low. Instead, Yedan leapt high, twisted parallel with the ground, legs thrown out, and rolled in the air, over the Hound’s shoulders, and as he spun, down swung the sword.\\n\\n The Hust blade shrieked as it bit, athwart the beast’s spine, driving down through vertebrae and then spinal cord.\\n\\n He glanced off its hip coming down, and that hip fell one way and Yedan the other. Striking the ground, he rolled and came to his feet, eyes still on the Hound.\\n\\n Watched as it toppled, body thumping on the sand, head following. Its eyes stared sightlessly. And beyond the dead beast, rows of faces. Letherii. Shake. Gape-mouthed like fools.\\n\\n He pointed at Brevity. ‘Captain! Advance the flank – shallow wedge! Push into the Liosan and push hard!’\\n\\n With that he turned and ran across the strand. He’d seen two more Hounds.\\n\\n Ahead, a wedge formation of Liosan soldiers had closed with Pithy’s Letherii and neither side was yielding. Yedan could not see the Hound – had they killed it? No – there, trying to retreat to Lightfall’s wound. Should he let it go?\\n\\n No .\\n\\n But to reach it, he would have to carve through a score of Liosan.\\n\\n They saw him, and recoiled.\\n\\n The Hust sword’s laugh was shrill.\\n\\n Yedan cut the first two down and wounded another before he was temporarily slowed by the rest of them. Swords hacked at him, slashed for his face. Others thrust for his belly and thighs. He blocked, countered. Twisted, pushed forward.\\n\\n Severed arms and hands spun, releasing the weapons they’d held. Blood sprayed and spat, bodies reeled. Flashes of wild expressions, mouths opening in pain and shock. And then he was past them all, in his wake carnage and horror.\\n\\n The Hound was three strides from the breach, struggling to stay upright.\\n\\n He saw its head turn, looked into its eyes, both of which wept blood. Torn lips formed ragged black lines as it snarled at him, heaving to meet him—\\n\\n But not in time. A thrust. A slash. The Hound’s guts billowed out and spilled to the ground in a brown splash of fluids.\\n\\n It sank down, howling.\\n\\n Yedan leapt on to its back –\\n\\n – in time to see a fourth Hound lunge through the gate. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-crippled-god-the-malazan-book-of-the-fallen-10/page-225.html","bookId":2012,"book":{"id":2012,"title":"The Crippled God (The Malazan Book of the Fallen #10)","description":"Storyline: The Bonehunters march for Kolanse, led by Adjunct Tavore.
