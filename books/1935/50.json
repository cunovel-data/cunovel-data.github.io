How much longer will we manage to stay out of the bedroom? Don’t answer, because I can tell you right now, it won’t be long. You know it and so do I.”\n Dave threw back his head, laughed and then swept her back into his embrace. “Carolyn, oh, Carolyn, I love you so damned much. There isn’t a solitary reason on God’s green earth that you should marry a felon like me, but if you want me…”\n “Oh, I want you all right. I want you so much I wonder if I can last the three-day waiting period after we apply for the license.” Only then did she start to laugh, too. Tears ran down her cheeks and she was laughing and crying at once. The man who’d been dead was now alive. No—that wasn’t exactly right. Doug was dead, but Dave was alive. Alive and in love with her.\n Joe and Susannah parked in the Memorial Hospital lot and went up to Vivian’s room, where they found her eating lunch with every appearance of appetite. The color was back in her cheeks and she looked better than she had in weeks.\n Susannah had been anticipating this visit. She’d had a long heart-to-heart talk with her husband, and together they’d reached a major decision. She’d begun to feel trapped in her job and now acknowledged that this phase of her life was coming to a natural end. A new one was about to begin.\n “Should we tell your mother?” Joe asked.\n “Yes. I think she’ll be pleased.”\n “Hi, Mom,” she said, coming all the way into the room and bringing Joe with her. “Look who’s here. And look what I brought.” She held a vase filled with white and pink roses from the garden and carefully placed it on the windowsill.\n Vivian brightened and set aside her fork. “Joe!” She held out her arms for a hug. She sounded more and more like her old self. “Chrissie said you were in town. It’s so good to see you.”\n Joe folded Vivian in his arms and gave her a gentle hug. “How are you feeling?” he asked.\n “Better now that you’re here.” Her gaze went from Joe to Susannah. “The flowers are lovely, dear.” She raised her eyebrows. “You have the same look you always did as a little girl when there was something you were dying to tell me.”\n “I do?” It wasn’t any wonder; Susannah was giddy with excitement, giddy with joy.\n “You might as well tell her right away,” Joe said, sliding his arm around her waist. He smiled down on her, his eyes alight with love.\n Susannah drew in her breath and blurted it out. “Mom, I’m going to buy a flower shop.”\n Vivian’s eyes widened. “A what?”\n “A flower shop. Joe and I talked almost all night. I need a career change. I’m burned out as a teacher. In fact, it’s only been during these last few weeks that I recognized what was happening.”\n “A flower shop,” her mother repeated as though testing the idea. “Where?”\n “In downtown Seattle, on Blossom Street. Joe was there this week and he saw the For Sale sign at Fannie’s Flowers. He stopped in to investigate and ask her some questions. I haven’t talked to the owner myself yet, but the terms seem very reasonable. It feels so right, Mom.”\n Vivian looked at Joe. “That stubborn daughter of mine needs you, doesn’t she?”\n “I keep telling her that,” Joe said, winking at Susannah.\n Susannah nudged him in the ribs with her elbow.\n “Did you see the doctor today, Mom?” she asked quickly.\n Vivian nodded. “He says I’ve got a ways to go, but I’ll do it.”\n “I know you will,” Joe said, “and Susannah and I will visit often.”\n “Good. Bring some of those flowers when you do.” She reached for her napkin. “It wasn’t easy giving up my home, but I realize now it was the best thing for me. Changing careers will be good for Susannah, too.” Her mother sounded more clearheaded than she had all summer.\n “I think so, too, Mom.”\n “I haven’t seen you this happy in…in years, Susannah.”\n “I am happy, Mom. I feel wonderful.” Her mother might be experiencing memory problems, but her intuition was in excellent working order. Although Susannah hadn’t said a word about her father, she knew that Vivian sensed she’d made peace with the past and was looking forward to her future.\n “Good.” Her mother nodded once. Using the napkin to dab her mouth, she casually said, “George was by.”\n “Dad?” Susannah asked, sharing a secret smile with her husband.\n “No, no, my friend George from Altamira. He didn’t get to stay long, but it’s nice to have company.” Her mother blushed as she said it. “There’s nothing romantic about it, mind you. George is my friend. He told me there’s a big bingo pot building and I should hurry back before someone else gets it.” Then she abruptly switched gears. “Fannie’s Flowers? Will you keep the name?”\n Susannah hadn’t thought about that yet; the idea was still being born. “I don’t know. Do you have a suggestion?”\n Her mother nodded, eyes twinkling. “Call it Susannah’s Garden.”\n “Susannah’s Garden,” she repeated slowly. She liked the sound of it.\n “There’s a yarn store next door,” Joe added. “They apparently offer classes.”\n This was good news. Her mother had taught her to knit years ago, but Susannah hadn’t picked up her needles in far too long. She’d love to take a class if she could fit it into her new schedule.\n Vivian lay back against the pillow, looking tired.\n “We’ll let you rest now, but we’ll be back later,” Susannah said.\n Her mother accepted Susannah’s kiss on her cheek. Grabbing hold of her arm, Vivian whispered, “Joe loves you.”\n “I know, and I love him, too,” she whispered back.\n As they approached the elevator, Joe stole a kiss before he pushed the call button.\n Stepping into the elevator, she moved into Joe’s arms. “I hope you know how very much I love you.”\n Joe backed her into the corner and kissed her passionately. They hardly noticed that the elevator had come to a stop and the doors slid open.\n “Look, Mom, newlyweds,” a young girl squealed from the hospital lobby.\n Embarrassed, Susannah and Joe disentangled their arms and self-consciously walked onto the marble floor.\n “Are you newlyweds?” the youngster asked.\n Joe chuckled. “In a manner of speaking, we are,” he told her, reaching for Susannah’s hand.\n She’d found her husband again this summer—the summer that changed everything. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/susannah-s-garden-blossom-street-3/page-50.html","bookId":1935,"book":{"id":1935,"title":"Susannah\u0027s Garden (Blossom Street #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Susannah\u0027s Garden (Blossom Street #3) \n When Susannah Nelson turned eighteen, she said goodbye to her boyfriend, Jake--and never saw him again.
