He recognized the alien limb—thesplitting cilia feelers and globu.lar sensory organs could belong only to a Covenant Engineer. \n \n The Engineer pushed open the hatch and entered the ship, floating past John and Linda as if they weren\u0027t there. It chittered and squawked as it ran its tentacles over the foreign armor plates and spatters of lead. Two more Engineers bolted through the open hatchand joined the first. \n \n As long as they left the single-minded aliens to their work, they wouldn\u0027t raise an alarm.But what else was out there? \n \n John eased against the frame of the hatch and slid the fiber.optic probe outside. Therewas a line of dropships, Seraph fight.ers, and other singleships that stretched away into the shadows. Swarms of Engineers, thousands of the creatures, hovered and driftedthroughout the area. They moved parts, disassembled and reassembled sections of shiphulls, and plumbed plasma coils. There was no trace of a welcome party of Elites waitingfor Blue Team. \n \n John turned the optic probe up and saw a latticework deck overhead with tools, welders,and spotlights hanging like jungle vines. It was as good a place as any to get theirbearings. \n \n John turned and pointed at Linda and Will, then out the hatch and up. They nodded and moved out. \n \n 304HALO: FIRST STRIKEFive seconds later acknowledgment lights from Blue Four and Three winked on. It was safe for the rest of them. \n \n John grabbed the upper lip of the hatchway and flipped up onto the top of the dropship.He grabbed a dangling cord and pulled himself onto the latticework deck where Fred and Linda perched, watching and making sure the bay was clear. \n \n Grace and Fred disembarked and scrambled silently up into the darkness, joining them. \n \n John pointed two fingers at his eyes and then made a flat fan motion across the space ofthe bay. The Spartans moved to care.fully scan the area. \n \n From his shadowy overview John saw that this place was a repair-and-refit facility, withslots for hundreds of singleships. The room curved out of view three hundred meters ineither di.rection. It must run the circumference of the station\u0027s hub. \n \n Apart from the thousands of busy Engineers, John spotted only two Grunts wearing whitemethane-breather masks. It was not a color designation he had seen before. They pushedcarts containing barrels of sloshing fluids. They would be easy to avoid. \n \n One side of the bay had a series of sealed doors that he pre.sumed led to air locks. The opposite wall of the bay had a meter-thick window through which poured an intense blue light. \n \n Every thirty meters along that transparent wall was a recessed alcove. Overflowing from the nearest alcove were purple poly.hedral cargo barrels, old charred plasma coils, and plates of the silver-blue Covenant alloy. But what piqued John\u0027s interest was what was next to this pile of junk: a holographic terminal. \n \n John clicked his COM to get Blue Team\u0027s attention, pointed to the junk pile, held up two fingers, and then pointed again at the alcove. \n \n Everyone nodded, understanding his order. \n \n Fred and Linda silently dropped to the deck, ran across the bay, and melted into theshadows behind a cut section of hull. Grace followed. \n \n John looked up and down and side to side across the bay, mak.ing sure no Grunts werevisible. He and Will crossed and took cover behind a plasma coil the size of a Warthoglight reconnais.sance vehicle. \n \n ERIC NYLUND305He used both hands to point at Fred and Linda, turned his hands so they pointed tohimself, and then nodded to the data terminal. \n \n Linda la flat and slithered to the edge of the alcove shadows on his right; Fred took theleft. Theyyy would cover him while he moved to the terminal. \n \n John reached to the back of his neck and pulled Cortana\u0027s chip from his skull. He crawledon his stomach, hugging the wall un.til he got to the terminal. He slid Cortana\u0027s chip intothe input slot and then eased back into the shadows. \n \n \"I\u0027m in,\" Cortana reported over the COM. \"I have secured our own channel and encryptedthe signal so we\u0027re free to use the interteam COM.\"\"Good work,\" John told her. \"Is there a central reactor in this station? How well defendedis it?\"\"Stand by. I have to move carefully. There are Covenant secu.rity AIs in this system.\"John hoped that this copy of Cortana\u0027s infiltration routines was as good as the realCortana. \n \n \"I have schematics for the station,\" she told him. \"The good news is, each lobe has acentral reactor complex with five hun.dred twelve-terawatt units similar in design to thepinch fusion reactors on their ships. Apparently this energy is used to power a shieldgenerator that can repel the collision of a small moon. I can overload one reactor, causingthe melting of its field coils, which will saturate the surrounding—\"\"Will it explode?\" John asked impatiently. \n \n \"Yes—an explosion of sufficient force to vaporize both sections.\"\"That\u0027s the good news? Whatt\u0027\"s the bad? \n \n \"The reactor\u0027s control system is isolated. I cannot reach it from this terminal. You willhave to physically deliver me there.\"\"Where is \u0027there\u0027?\"\"The nearest reactor-control access point is seven kilometers farther into the station\u0027stop lobe.\"John considered this. If they were careful and lucky, it might be possible. \n \n \"Is there a way to leave you in the central system until we need306HALO: FIRST STRIKEyou?\" he asked. \"It would be handy to have you monitor the Covenant security systems.\"The duplicate Cortana was silent a full three seconds. \"There is a way,\" she finally replied. \n \n \"When I was copied from the origi.nal Cortana, the duplicating software was copied aswell—it becomes an inseparable part of all subsequent copies. I can use this to copymyself into this system.\"\"Perfect.\"\"There are risks, however,\" Cortana told him. \"Each succes.sive copy containsaberrations that I cannot correct. There may be unforeseen complications associated withusing a copy of a copy.\"\"Do it,\" John ordered. \"I\u0027ll take that chance. But I\u0027m not will.ing to take a chance oncrossing seven kilometers behind enemy lines without a way to bypass their securitysystems.\"\"Standby,\" Cortana said. \"Working.\"A minute ticked off John\u0027s mission timer. Then the data chip ejected from the terminal. \n \n \"Done,\" Cortana said over the interteam COM. \"I\u0027m in. There\u0027s an exit to this bay thirtymeters to your left. I will black out the security cameras there and open the door intwenty seconds. Hurry.\"John retrieved the chip and reinserted it into his skull. There was a flash of cold mercuryin his mind. \n \n \"Move out,\" John told Blue Team. \"Stay low.\"Fred\u0027s and Linda\u0027s acknowledgment lights flickered, indicat.ing the way was clear. \n \n Blue Team ran, crouching, for thirty meters. A small access panel slid open, they piledthrough—then the door snapped shut behind them. \n \n They proceeded, hunched over; they crawled on their hands and knees, on theirstomachs, and through ducting so tight they had to shut down their shields and scrape byon bare armor over metal. For kilometers they followed Cortana\u0027s directions, halt.ing as she ran motion sensors through diagnostics until they passed ... twisting and turning and shimmying down long lengths of pipe, dodging the giant blades of circulation fans, and edging by transformer coils so close that sparks arced across their shields. \n \n ERIC NYLUND307According to John\u0027s mission timer they had followed this route for eleven hours—when itdead-ended. \n \n \"New welds,\" Fred said, running his gauntlet over the seams in the alloy plate blockingtheir path. \n \n Cortana broke in over the COM, \"It must be a repair not logged into the station manifest.\"John said. \"Options?\"Cortana replied, \"I have only limited mission-planning rou.tines. There are three obvious options. You can blow the ob.structing plate with a Lotus antitank mine. You can return to the repair bay where we might find a less obvious way in. Or there is a faster,alternative route, but it has drawbacks.\"\"Time is running out,\" John said. \"The Covenant aren\u0027t going to stick around much longer before they strike Earth. Give me the faster route.\"\"Backtrack four hundred meters, turn bearing zero-nine-zero, proceed another twenty meters, and exit through a waste access cover. From there you will move in the open for seven hundred meters, pass through a structure, and then down a guarded corri.dor tothe reactor chambers.\"Grace interrupted, \"What do you mean \u0027in the open\u0027? This is a space station; there shouldbe no open spaces.\"\"See for yourself,\" Cortana said. \n \n A schematic of the \"open space\" appeared on their heads-up displays. John wasn\u0027t able tomake much sense of the diagram, but he could tell there were several catwalks, buildings,and even waterways—as Cortana indicated, lots of open areas for them to be seen in. \n \n \"Let\u0027s take a look,\" John said. \n \n He led his team back the way they had come and pushed open the waste access duct. Bluelight flooded the tunnel. John blinked and let his eyes adjust, then pushed the fiber-opticprobe through the opening. \n \n John didn\u0027t understand what he saw—the optical probe must have malfunctioned. Theimage looked impossibly distorted. But there was no motion nearby ... so he risked pokinghis head out. \n \n He was in the end of an alley with walls towering ten meters to either side, casting darkshadows over the waste access hole. A308HALO: FIRST STRIKEgroup of Jackals passed the mouth of the alley only five meters from his position. Heducked ... and none of the vulturelike creatures saw him in the dark. \n \n When they passed he looked up and saw that the fiber-optic probe had not been brokenafter all. \n \n The space station was hollow inside, and a light beam shot lengthwise through its center:a blue light that provided full day.light illumination. Along the curved inner surface wereneedle-thin spires, squat stair-step pyramids, and columned temples. Catwalks withmovi surfaces crisscrossed the space, as did tubes with capsules that whiskedpassengngngers. Water flowed along the walls in inward-spiral patterns and then waterfalled\"up\" into great hollow towers that sprouted from the opposite wall. \n \n Banshees flew in formation through the center space of the great room, as did flocks ofheadless birds and great clouds of butterflies. It could have been an Escher etching cometo life. \n \n John felt extreme vertigo for a moment. Then he understood that with advancedCovenant gravity technology, there didn\u0027t have to be an up or down here. \n \n Odd that a military station would have so much unnecessary ornamentation. Yet Fleet HQhad a large atrium in their lobby. Maybe this was the Covenant equivalent—multiplied ahundredfold. \n \n John spied a band of translucent material set into a far wall, glistening. \"Is that thewindow to the repair bays, Cortana?\"\"Correct,\" she replied. \n \n \"Then at least we know the way out. And the structure we need to enter?\"\"One o\u0027clock,\" she said. \"The one with the carved columns. It is the most direct route tothe reactor chambers.\"John moved out of the hole and hugged the nearby wall. The shadows in the brightdaylight would do a decent job of camou.flaging them. \n \n \"Okay, Blue Team. Get oriented... as much as you can. Our target is the columned buildingat one o\u0027clock. I make it to be a three-hundred-meter sprint across open ground. We\u0027llmake a break for it. Unless anyone has a better plan?\"Linda emerged, looked around, and said, \"Permission to post on the rooftop and providecover.\"ERIC NYLUND309\"Do it,\" John said. \"Let me know when you\u0027re in position and ready.\"Linda retrieved a padded grappling hook and rope from her pack, twirled it, and tossed itup and over the adjacent roof. She tugged it once, it caught, and then she quicklyascended. \n \n The remaining Spartans joined John in the shadows. He shouldered his battle rifle and thumbed the safety off. \n \n Linda\u0027s acknowledgment light winked once. \n \n John tensed and ran. It took him three strides to build to his top-speed sprint. Hisadrenaline spiked and it made his blood burn. He felt time slow, his perception running atan overclocked pace. He focused on speed— putting one foot in front of the other. Hisboots dug into cobblestones, crushed rock, and sent a fine spray of gravel behind him. He saw three obstacles in his path: a group of startled Grunts. He slammed the butt of hisrifle into the nearest one, and crushed its skull. The dead Grunt spun end over end and landed in a heap. He heard squawks and shouts around him but didn\u0027t stop to look. \n \n He was on the stairs of the building, worn-smooth stone steps that he bounded up five ata time. John saw three friendly con.tacts behind him on his motion tracker ... and at theperiphery of its range a solid mass of enemy contacts. \n \n \"You\u0027re good so far,\" Linda reported. \"There are Elites, but they\u0027re unarmed. No, wait. AHunter pair is advancing on your position. Stand by.\"A quartet of shots split the air like thunderclaps. \n \n \"Threat neutralized,\" Linda said. \"The rest of them are scat.tering. Bansheesapproaching. I\u0027m moving.\"John cleared the stairs and skidded to a halt on the threshold of the temple. The interiorwas cold; external temperature read.ings were near freezing. Light filtered in throughstained-glass windows in the ceiling—tinged lavender, cobalt, and turquoise. Three rowsof giant columns made of blue-black basalt ran the length of the thirty-meter-longrectangular structure, casting long shadows. It was a good place for an ambush. He set hisback against one of the pillars and swept the entrance, covering his team as they entered. \n \n \"Cortana, update on station security?\" John said. \n \n 310HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"There are dozens of reports on the security channels. I\u0027ve got them covered.\"Another Cortana voice broke in over the first: \"Also be ad.vised, Chief, that there areceremonial guards in this temple—a race we have not encountered before. Roughlytranslated from Covenant dialects, they are called \u0027Brutes.\u0027 They shouldn\u0027t be a significantthreat or they would have been used in previous mili.tary situations.\"John wasn\u0027t so sure of that. The name Brute didn\u0027t sound promising. He also wonderedwhy there now seemed to be more than one Cortana in the station\u0027s system—but thatcould wait. They had to keep moving now that they had revealed their posi.tion. Hewaved Blue Team forward. \n \n John took point. He moved up to the next column in the mid.dle of the building. Fred andWill stepped over to the columns on either side behind John. Grace had their backs. \n \n There was a flicker on his motion sensor—just ahead. It vanished. \n \n John held up his hand. Blue Team froze. \n \n His motion detector was clear ... but there had been some.thing there. \n \n He pulled out a frag grenade. \n \n The transient contact was back—a shadow moved around the same pillar John used forcover. It moved faster than an Elite— as fast as John. \n \n He fired his rifle point blank into the shadowy silhouette. It didn\u0027t slow—it only howledWill and Fred fired three-round bursts from their rifles into the creature. It flinched with with rage. \n \n each bullet impact. \n \n Three explosions detonated behind them. Grace\u0027s biosign alarm shrilled and flashed onJohn\u0027s heads-up display. \n \n \"Ambush!\" Will cried out. \n \n The creature Cortana had called a \"Brute\" stepped from the shadows and faced John. Itwas taller than an Elite—wider and more muscular. Its mouth was lined with razor-sharpteeth, and its red eyes burned with hate. Its blue-gray skin was riddled with bullet holes. \n \n The Brute tackled John, knocking his weapon from his grasp. \n \n ERIC NYLUND311Even with his MJOLNIR armor, John was not as strong as the alien. \n \n It pounded on him with bare fists—broke through his shield.ing, grabbed his neck, andsqueezed. \n \n Red flashes played across John\u0027s vision. He began to black out. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30073.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
