After the Chief had left to investigate the cryopod, Haverson made certain that the bridge doors locked. He turned and walked over to the Covenant Engineer who\u0027d repaired theMaster Chief\u0027s armor. \"Fascinating creatures,\" he murmured. He drew his sidearm and pointed it at the back ofits head. Two of the Engineer\u0027s six eyes locked onto the muzzle of the weapon. A tentacle reachedfor it, split into fine probing threads, and touched the blue-gray metal. Cortana asked, \"What are you—\"Haverson shot the Engineer. The round tore through its head and spattered gore across the display the alien had been repairing. \"Haverson!\" Cortana cried. The other Engineer turned and squealed—then a blinking light on the broken display captured its attention and it returned to its work, oblivious. Haverson knelt by the dead Engineer and holstered his gun. \"I had no other choice,\" hewhispered. He touched the creature\u0027s odd, slick skin. Its color faded from a faint pink to a cold gray. He dragged it to the escape hatch, opened it, and placed the body in the corridor. He paused, and went back to fold its tenta.cles over its body. \"I\u0027m sorry. You didn\u0027t deserve it.\"\"Why was that necessary?\" Cortana demanded. Haverson stood, wiped his hands on his slacks, and sealed the escape hatch access. \"I\u0027msurprised you even have to ask, Cor.tana.\" He heard the anger in his voice. He checkedhis rising ire. ERIC NYLUND 97He wasn\u0027t mad at Cortana; he was mad at himself—furious be.cause of the ugly necessityof his act. \"The Covenant are imitative—not innovative,\" he said. \"The Engineer you ordered torepair the Chief\u0027s armor just got a first.hand look at our shield technology, a technology we stole from the Covenant and improved upon. If it somehow managed to re.join theCovenant, that improved technology would be theirs. How would you like to see thattechnology manifest as better personal shields for their Elite warriors? Or on theirwarships?\"Cortana was silent. \"Corporal Locklear was right,\" Haverson muttered. \"I really hate this shit, too.\"\"I understand,\" Cortana finally replied, but her voice was so cold it could have frozen helium. Haverson sighed and looked at his hands. The Engineer\u0027s blood tattooed his skin with tinypinpoints of blue-black. \"Do you think that the Master Chief will find what he\u0027s reallylooking for on Reach?\"\"What do you mean \u0027really looking for\u0027?\" Cortana said. Her voice was still frosty, butcuriosity thawed her tone. \"I mean the other Spartans.\" Haverson gave a short laugh. \"True, his argument to go toReach was valid—we wouldn\u0027t be going otherwise. But that\u0027s not what he\u0027s after. He sent his team down to the surface of Reach... sent them to their deaths. What commander wouldn\u0027t go back? And what commander wouldn\u0027t hope that they were alive? No matter what the odds?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30050.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
