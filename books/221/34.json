The tendons in the Brute\u0027sforearms were solid bands of steel—and the creature was so determined to rip John\u0027shead off that a full clip from a rifle into its chest hadn\u0027t even slowed it down. \n \n Behind him, John felt another explosion thunder though the stone floor, followed by thestaccato rattle of rifle fire. \n \n Blue Team was busy with another threat. He was on his own. \n \n John blinked. The darkness dimming the edge of his vision wouldn\u0027t clear. \n \n John watched his shield bar flicker and sluggishly recharge. If it built up enough repulsiveforce, he might have a chance to wriggle out of the Brute\u0027s grasp. If he tried too quickly,though, the Brute wouldn\u0027t lose its grip and could pound his shield flat again. \n \n The Brute bellowed, and globules of spittle spattered onto the Chief\u0027s visor. It leanedcloser, screwing its massive hands tighter around his throat. \n \n John\u0027s vision narrowed. His windpipe swelled, and he gagged. \n \n Shields were at one quarter charge. It\u0027d have to be enough. \n \n John had been in similar death-grip holds before—endless hours of training on thewrestling mats with his teammates and martial arts specialists provided by Chief Mendez.There were ways to escape a larger, stronger opponent. And there were al.wayscountermoves to those escapes. And countermoves to those counters. It was like a gameof chess, except the pieces were armsERIC NYLUNO313and legs, torque and your center of mass ... and most impor.tantly your mind. \n \n He pulled his knees to his chest, and tucked his torso toward his pelvis at the same time.He twisted ninety degrees and shot out both legs and arms, and uncoiled his body. Themaneuver was called \"shrimping.\"John\u0027s head slipped from the Brute\u0027s grasp. \n \n He used the monster\u0027s split second of disorientation to scram.ble onto its back. Johnbrought his elbow down on the base of the Brute\u0027s neck. He swept out its elbow,wrenched the joint around, and pushed it as far as it would go—far past the point anyhu.man\u0027s or Elite\u0027s would have sna ped. John scissored his legs wide and pushed againstthe floor, leveraging his body to keeppp the Brute pinned. \n \n It growled and pushed itself and John up with its one free arm. \n \n \"No. You. Don\u0027t.\"John still clutched a frag grenade in his left hand. He flicked the arming pin—reachedaround and under, and thrust it into the Brute\u0027s belt—then withdrew, sweeping out itsone arm holding them up. \n \n The Brute dropped onto the floor and screamed with rage. \n \n The grenade detonated. It lifted them both a meter, and they landed again ... this timeaccompanied by a wet, pulpy smack as the Brute\u0027s dead hulk slammed into the ground. \n \n The Master Chief rolled off and sprang to his feet and looked for Blue Team.and sprang to his feet and looked for Blue Team. \n \n The large pillars blocked his view, but he saw on his motion tracker that Fred was behinda pillar down and to John\u0027s left, and Will behind the pillar to the right. There was no tag indicating Grace\u0027s location. There were, however, blurry motion contacts beyond thewide arched entrance to the temple. \n \n And there was one other thing—neither Will nor Fred checked John\u0027s status over theCOM. That silence meant trouble. \n \n John fumbled for his fiber-optic probe, but it had been lost in the scuffle with the Brute.He eased around the basalt pillar. \n \n Grace lay face-first on the floor, five meters from the temple en.trance. A puddle ofhydrostatic gel and blood spread across the floor. \n \n John clicked the COM once, a status query. \n \n 314HALO: FIRST STRIKEThe instant he did this, two Brutes wheeled from their cover on either side of theentrance archway. They held rifles with large-caliber muzzles and padded stocks, fixedwith razor-edged blades. One of the Brutes saw John, aimed, and fired. \n \n John darted back behind the basalt pillar; he saw the flash and thunder of a grenadelaunched from the weapon—heard two more rounds fired immediately after that. \n \n The first grenade impacted on the opposite side of the pillar and exploded. The overpressure rattled his teeth. \n \n The Chief turned and dived, hoping to get behind the next stone column before——the second and third grenades impacted and detonated on the pillar he had stoodbehind a split second before. The solid stone crumbled into fist-sized chunks. \n \n He skidded and scrambled for cover as the upper part of that column collapsed, raining stones that shattered the floor... and would have crushed him. \n \n So much for engaging these Brutes in a direct assault. John wasn\u0027t up for another round ofwrestling, either. Not with the clock ticking. Not with every Covenant on this station about to tear them to pieces. Complicating all this was the enemy\u0027s appar.ent ability tolocate them when they used the COM. \n \n That only left one tactical option: run. \n \n He wasn\u0027t going to leave Grace behind, though. Not until he knew for certain she wasHe removed his backpack and took out one of his two Lotus antitank mines. The disk wasa quarter meter across with spikes set along the rim to stabilize it when buried. He set thedetona.tion selector to countdown mode, seven seconds. He then slid around the edge ofthe column. \n \n He threw the mine with a flick of his wrist. It spun in a wide arc across the temple halland embedded into the wall just over the entrance archway. \n \n Two seconds until it blew. \n \n John clicked on his COM and said: \"Fire in the hole!\"The Brutes again wheeled around from their cover and lev.eled their deadly grenadelaunchers. \n \n The Lotus mine detonated—it was a flash and an instant ofERIC NYLUND315fire. The temple opening and Brutes vanished, replaced by a cloud of dust and a cascadeof stones that fell from the ceiling. \n \n One gray arm remained exposed under the rubble, still flexing. \n \n John moved up. The entrance was sealed. They were safe for a few seconds. \n \n He knelt next to Grace. Her biosigns had flatlined. He tried to roll her upright—but there was no need. The detonations he had heard while wrestling the first Brute had been three of their high-velocity grenades... which had blown Grace\u0027s midsection apart. \n \n Fred and Will emerged from their cover. John looked at mem and shook his head. \n \n John opened the tiny access panel on Grace\u0027s armor power pack and entered the fail-safecode. They still had a mission to finish, which meant they couldn\u0027t carry her out; it wouldslow them down too much. They wouldn\u0027t be leaving her for the Covenant either, though.Her armor\u0027s tiny fusion reactor would overload and burn everything within a ten-meter radius— Grace\u0027s funeral pyre. \n \n \"Let\u0027s move,\" John said. \"Cortana, which way?\"\"Proceed into the temple thirty meters. Turn right. There will be a sealed doorway, an access hatch for Engineers. I will open it and lock it behind you. Hurry. I\u0027m encounteringincreased resistance from the station\u0027s AIs. While I have their security COM channelsblocked, word of intruders is speeding via private COMs.\"There was a curious echo to her voice. Maybe it was feedback from the Covenanttriangulating on their signals. Or maybe there was some other effect at work. What hadshe warned him about? Unforeseen complications using a copy of a copy of Cortana? \n \n \"Roger that,\" he said and waved Fred and Will forward. He took one last look at Grace,then marched quickly and silently ahead. \n \n There were no more motion contacts in the temple. The Chief, however, saw Grunts andJackals, Elites and Hunters in murals painted on the walls. In the shadows and stained-glass filtered light, those pictures seemed to move. They genuflected to some.thingfarther ahead. The Chief wished he had more time to take a full video record. \n \n Blue Team moved thirty meters and turned to face a section of the wall. It parted. Thepassage could have fit two Engineers side316HALO: FIRST STRIKEby side, but John had to crouch and turn sideways to pass. Will and Fred followed;Cortana sealed the door behind them. \n \n They continued until the narrow passage turned ninety de.grees and dropped straightdown. Will attached a rope and they rappelled down a hundred meters, landing on aplatform. \n \n John overlooked a cavern hewn from rough stone that arched up ninety meters andvanished into the shadows in the distance. Five hundred twelve fusion reactors thatlooked like flatted spi.ral seashells filled the space, stacked in rows and columns eightdeep. Each was the size of a Pelican dropship and thrummed with power, casting offwaves of wavering heat. \n \n The open areas between the reactors were a tangle of plasma conduits and alive withswarms of thousands of buoyant Engi.neers as they tended the machinery. Faint wispyborealis com.prised of escaped plasma swirled, whipped into a luminous froth by theintense magnetic vortices within the chamber. \n \n It was a tremendous feat of engineering. It was as if the sta.tion\u0027s builders had hewn thisfrom a seed asteroid and built the rest of the installation around it. \n \n Will ointed across the room to three Jackals who walked along a catwalk. Blue Teamheld ppposition and didn\u0027t move. \n \n \"There,\" Cortana announced. \"Across the platform is a termi.nal on the reactor subsystem.\"John held up a hand to Will and Fred, waited for the Jackal guards to pass, and thensprinted across the platform. He re.moved Cortana\u0027s chip and inserted it into theterminal. \n \n After three seconds, she re orted: \"I\u0027m in. Very few Covenant counterintrusion measuresin this system. I can accomppplish the overload. \n \n \"I\u0027ve found an exit route for Blue Team and uploaded it into your NAV systems,\" shecontinued. \"It should be stealthy enough for you to return to the repair bay undetected.Once there, give me the order and I can begin. It will take ten minutes for the overload tobuild. There\u0027s no stopping once I start this, Chief, so be sure.\"\"This station and the Covenant fleet might jump to Earth in the next ten minutes,\" Johnsaid. He looked to Fred and Will, and they nodded as if they could read his mind. \n \n \"Proceed with the overload now, Cortana.\"ERIC NYLUND317The li ht from the reactors shifted; blue plasma tinged white and spread like a poisonthrougggh the interconnecting conduits. \n \n \"Overload commencing,\" the copy of Cortana announced. \"I suggest Blue Team move attop speed to the exit.\"A NAV triangle indicated a ladder that ran to the catwalk overhead. John held up twofingers at Will and Fred and then nodded to the patrolling Jackals. Fred and Will knelt,braced, and waited for him to go ahead. \n \n John climbed the ladder. As he neared the top, three shots rang out behind him. Thesound was nearly drowned out by the inten.sifying reverberations from the reactors. Hecleared the top of the ladder and saw three dead Jackals on the catwalk. He swept bothdirections with his rifle and then waved Will and Fred forward. \n \n His countdown timer read 9.47. The heat and light from the re.actors grew stronger, andJohn\u0027s shields flared slightly. \n \n Blue Team jogged down the catwalk to an elevator. They got inside, the doors closed, andthe car immediately ascended. \n \n When the doors opened again, artificial blue sunlight filled the car—as did the shadowscast by two Elites waiting for the elevator. Blue Team opened fire and cut down the Elites,leaving a spray of blood across the ground. \n \n The Chief edged around the frame of the elevator door and saw a tangle of pipes andfountains and one of the curious spiral waterways that fell up from its center. This was a heat exchange plant for the reactors below. Already the water in the canals steamed and boiled. \n \n He saw that Covenant Elite and Hunter pairs had converged at the entrance to the templea hundred meters to his right. Over the temple dozens of Banshee fliers circled thecarnage. \n \n A gang of Grunts managed to clear an opening to the temple. There was a flash of lightand fire that roiled out in a long plume, burning them as well as their Elite overseers. \n \n \"Good-bye, Grace,\" John whispered. \n \n The detonation of her power pack would buy them more time while the Covenant forces tried to figure out what just happened— perhaps they\u0027d think Blue Team was still insidethe temple. Grace had also taken out a dozen Grunts and four Elites with her last action. That would have pleased her. \n \n 318HALO: FIRST STRIKEJohn turned toward the far end of the great room and spotted a band of translucent material on the far wall. It led to the repair bays and air locks beyond. That was their exit. \n \n He glanced at his mission timer: 8:42. They\u0027d have to get there fast. \n \n His gaze locked onto the Banshees in the air. He searched for Linda, posted somewhere inthe odd geometry of this station. She could be anywhere along several kilometers ofcityscape. \n \n John clicked on his COM. \"Linda, do not reply. The Covenant are triangulating on our signals. I\u0027m hoping they do and send a few of those Banshees to reconnoiter. When they get close to the heat-exchange plant, take them out—we\u0027ll need their vehicles.\"There was no answer. Did that mean Linda understood and was in a position to help? Or was she dead? \n \n As John hoped, three Banshees peeled off the search forma.tion, circling the temple and turning toward them. \n \n John waved Fred and Will out of the elevator and into the for.est of steaming pipes. They scattered, took cover, and aimed at the incoming Banshees. \n \n The Banshees spread out, slowed... but then banked, return.ing to the temple. \n \n John clicked his COM three times.imes. \n \n The Elite pilots immediately wheeled about and accelerated toward their position. One Banshee flier nosed into a classic strafing dive. Its plasma cannons warmed and crackledwith en.ergy, indicating an imminent discharge. \n \n There was a spray of blood in the flier, then the pilot fell for.ward and pushed theaccelerator to full. The Banshee careened through the air at maximum velocity—crashinginto a water-recovery tower, and wobbled to the ground. \n \n \"Linda,\" John muttered and tried to spot her. Judging from the blood spray, she\u0027dmanaged to send a round through the tiny ex.posed area of the cockpit, and inflicted alethal ricochet. He looked for her position; most likely the shot had come from be.hindand above. There were numerous catwalks running across the length of the massive room. She had to be on one of them. \n \n The two remaining Banshees accelerated toward Blue Team. Their plasma cannons flickered, and they leveled into a flat trajectory. \n \n ERIC NYLUND319John, Fred, and Will raised their rifles. \n \n There was a muted crack of a sniper rifle, and another Ban.shee drifted to the ground, itspilot felled by Linda\u0027s uncanny skill. \n \n The last remaining pilot veered starboard, not knowing what had just taken out its two wingmates ... only that it had to get out of the area if it was going to live. In the tightest arc of its curve, the craft slowed. John couldn\u0027t tell precisely where the shot came from, but athird sniper round ricocheted through the craft\u0027s cockpit. The Banshee spun in circles before it thumped to a halt, nose-down in the street. \n \n Three impossible shots, three kills. Even for Linda, this was superb shooting—the finestshots John had ever seen. He looked around the station, over the buildings, spires,catwalks, transit tubes—it was impossible to spot her. \n \n John waved Fred and Will toward two of the downed Ban.shees and sprinted toward theone still spinning riderless in the street, its canards scraping and sparking along thestones. \n \n He climbed aboard, pushed the throttle forward, and pointed to the far wall. He held hishand flat and lowered it, indicating that Fred and Will should skim low to the ground. \n \n John veered off in a wide arc. Maybe he could divert the atten.tion away from them. \n \n He rose slightly higher and buzzed the tops of gilt domes and statues of Elite heroes withraised swords. Grunts and Jackals scattered as he approached, and John fired at them. He shifted to the side as he splashed though water falling from one side of the station to theother. \n \n Four Banshee fliers fell in behind him. John weaved back and forth. A pair of plasma boltssizzled over his head. \n \n He risked a look over his shoulder and saw two of the Ban.shees drop away. A moment later they crashed into the surface. \n \n Linda still had his back covered. \n \n He dropped to the ground and skimmed along a street, skid.ded, and turned into an alley.Banshee shadows passed overhead. He pushed the throttle to full and made a direct run toward the back wall. \n \n Will and Fred had grounded their fliers and crouched next to the meter-thick window separating this inner section from the320HALO: FIRST STRIKErepair bays. John settled his Banshee next to theirs, turned his backpack around, reachedin, and tossed Fred his last Lotus anti.tank mine. \n \n \"Get that on the window and set for a remote trigger.\" He then risked an open COM channel to the copy of Cortana in the station\u0027s system. \"Cortana, can you open the airlocks in the re.pair bay?\"A flurry of voices filled the COM, all speaking at the same time, shouting to be heard over one another ... all Cortana\u0027s voices. One finally broke through. \"Chief, I\u0027ve spun off a copy dedicated exclusively to communicating with you. Go ahead.\"\"How many copies are there of you?\"\"Unknown. Hundreds. The Covenant AI overwhelmed me. Had to. This is difficult. Many errors in my systems. Filtering overall subchannels of information. \n \n \"To answer your initial question: yes. I can override safety lockouts and open the airlocks. My systems are fragmenting. I cannot exist in a coherent state much longer.\"John looked out across the kilometers of curving cityscape. Wraith tanks rolled into thestreets; legions of Grunts, Jackals, and Elites raced from building to building and shot attargets that weren\u0027t there. Banshees and Ghosts buzzed through the air like clouds offlies. \n \n John\u0027s mission countdown timer read 7:45. \n \n \"Linda\u0027s back there,\" he told Fred and Will. Fred started to say something, but John cuthim off. \"If I\u0027m not back in three min.utes, blow that window and exit.\"Fred hesitated but then nodded. \n \n \"I can\u0027t leave her,\" John said and gunned his Banshee\u0027s throt.tle. \"Not if she\u0027s still alive.\"Dr. Halsey\u0027s last words to him resonated in John\u0027s mind: I should have been trying to saveevery single human life—no matter what it cost. \n \n He\u0027d get to Linda. He\u0027d get her out alive—or die trying. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30074.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
