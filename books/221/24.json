{"id":6849,"no":24,"title":"chapter 24","content":"TIME:DATE RECORD [[ERROR]]ANOMALY\\Date unknown \\ Captured Covenant dropshipnear flagship Ascendant Justice, in anomalous Slipspace bubble. \\n\\n \\n\\n The faintly blue luminous walls of the Covenant dropship pressed in, which made Johnfeel slightly claustrophobic. It was ironic when he stopped to think about it, because hewas always inside his skintight armor. His fellow Spartans sat in the bay be.side him,motionless. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred, designated Blue-Two on this mission, was John\u0027s second in command. He had foughtin more than 120 campaigns, was a great leader and a quick thinker. Sometimes he tookthe respon.sibility of his command too seriously, though, empathizing too deeply withany wounded member of his team. \\n\\n \\n\\n Li, Blue-Three, was the team\u0027s zero-gee combat specialist. He had trained extensivelywith microgravity equipment and mar.tial arts at the UNSC\u0027s extreme-conditions facilityon Chiron in orbit about Mars. He was as much at home in free fall as the rest of them were on solid land, and John was glad to have him on this mission. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anton, Blue-Four, had John worried. He spent most of his life with his feet firmly plantedon the ground. He\u0027d cross-trained in tracking, camouflage, and stealth, and had been usedalmost ex.clusively on ground-based operations. More than once he had expresseddiscomfort in zero-gee situations. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will, Blue-Five, was quiet, but had never failed to complete his mission. He wasn\u0027t always that way, though. When he was younger he was the one with the jokes and riddles thatkept the team\u0027s spirits high. Something had hardened in him over the220HALO: FIRST STRIKEyears ... as it had in them all. But with Will something special had been lost. \\n\\n \\n\\n Grace, Blue-Six, had a knack for explosives. She could shape a charge to cut through asingle steel bolt with only a whisper sound, or rig a hundred thousand liters of kerosene to blow into a firestorm from hell. Ironically her temper was nonexistent. \\n\\n \\n\\n John opened a COM channel. \"Give me a systems check, Blue Team.\"Five acknowledgment lights winked on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This reminds me of the underwater mission Chief Mendez sent us on at Emerald Cove,\" Fred whispered. \"When he sabo.taged half our air tanks? And we ended up stealing his.\"\"And after,\" Anton said, laughing, \"we ditched him and camped on that island. It was a week with nothing to do but light bonfires, bake clams, and surf.\"\"Mmrnmm,\" Grace added, \"calamari.\"John wondered if Emerald Cove even existed anymore. The UNSC had abandoned thatcolony a decade ago. The Covenant had most likely glassed that world. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blue Team.\" Polaski\u0027s voice broke over the COM. \"Local conditions are as calm as they\u0027re going to get. Exiting in three... two...one!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n John felt the acceleration in the pit of his stomach. He rose, moved to the hatch, andpopped it open. Outside, Ascendant Jus.tice\u0027s hull moved past them—almost every square centimeter of the flagship\u0027s polished alloy skin had been scarred by heat andmicrometeors; tendrils of metal vapor snaked and shimmered in the vacuum. \\n\\n \\n\\n On Ascendant Justice\u0027s upper deck he saw the looming shadow of the inverted UNSCfrigate Gettysburg still miracu.lously attached. It was on fire, pockmarked with craters,and venting atmosphere, but it was remarkably intact. If not for the thousands of deadNaval personnel undoubtedly on board, he might have christened the ship \"lucky.\"The dropship slowed and Polaski drifted, turned, and de.scended onto the surface of theship. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Latch engaged,\" she said over the COM. \"All yours, Chief.\"\"Fred, Grace, and I will reconnoiter,\" he told Blue Team. \"An.ton, Will, and Li, get ready tomove the arc welder and hull platesERIC NYLUND 221we scavenged from the Gettysburg when we give the all-clear signal.\"John eased his boots onto the hull. Their magnetic soles clamped onto the metal with asatisfying click. \\n\\n \\n\\n Polaski had landed the Covenant dropship so that its mandibles cradled the hole and gave them some shelter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Overhead, Slipspace was on fire. It looked as if someone had doused the night with jet fueland ignited it. Bloody, boiling streaks of flame tore across a midnight-blue sky. Meteors flashed past and sprayed molten metal in trails of glittering Stardust. \\n\\n \\n\\n A fist-sized projectile blurred past the Master Chief and rammed into the ship\u0027s starboardside. Sparks and liquefied alloy spattered into space. His shields flickered as debrisricocheted from the armor\u0027s protective field. \\n\\n \\n\\n They had to move fast. The Admiral was right: This was a shooting galley. The quickerthey sealed that hole and got out of here—the better. \\n\\n \\n\\n John turned and swept his rifle over the terrain. There were bumpy sensor nodes,kilometers of conduits, and a dozen gaping canyons in the hull. A legion of Covenantwarriors could hide in this mess. \\n\\n \\n\\n No enemy contact. Nothing on his motion sensors, either. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stepped close to the main-drive conduit and examined the hole. The pipe was fivemeters across and still red hot, even though Cortana had shut it down three minutes ago. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hole was round, a three-meter-wide gap, with ragged edges that all pointed inward. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If that was from a plasma strike,\" Grace said, \"the metal would have been boiled away. Ifit was from an impact, the edges would be scraped on one side, compacted on the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n This hole was deliberately made.\"\"Eyes sharp,\" John said. \"We have company. My guess is camouflaged Elites. Maybe someof the original crew still alive. Blue-Three, -Four, and -Five—move out.\"\"Roger,\" Will replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n Anton emerged from the dropship hefting an arc welder, while Will and Li maneuveredthe three-by-three-meter hull plates. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fred and Grace, you\u0027re on the welders,\" John ordered. \"An222HALO: FIRST STRIKEton, post on top of the dropship. Li, you\u0027re at three o\u0027clock. Will at nine. I\u0027ll take the six.\"Blue acknowledgment lights winked on. \\n\\n \\n\\n John helped Fred and Grace set the plates in position. Grace and Fred fired up the arcwelder, and pinpoints of metal liquefied beneath their tips. A shower of sparks swirledaround them in the evacuated environment like a swarm of fireflies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re in position, Admiral,\" John reported. \"ETA for repairs is two minutes.\"\"Roger, Chief,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. Ionization made the channel flood with static. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you\u0027re done, give the word and get secure—we\u0027ll be accelerating immediately.\"\"Yes, sir.\"So far, so good, John thought. Just another minute or two.t. Just another minute or two. \\n\\n \\n\\n A streamer of plasma appeared from nowhere. The tangled, crisscrossed Slipspacearound them dropped the bolt of boiling fire fifty meters overhead; it moved port tostarboard—and van.ished back into the void. \\n\\n \\n\\n The COM shattered into white noise, and the motion sensors blurred... as did the activecamouflage shielding of the six Elites who had been slowly—and until a moment agoimperceptibly— crawling toward their position. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Enemy contacts!\" John shouted. \\n\\n \\n\\n He crouched behind the dome of a sensor node and o ened fire. A hail of bullets caughtthe closest Elite dead-center in its chest. The gunfire pppunched through its shielding andthen tore into its armor. It tumbled backward and spun off the hull. \\n\\n \\n\\n In his peripheral vision John saw the silent muzzle flashes from his team. He glancedback; Fred and Grace hadn\u0027t moved. They stared at the beads of molten alloy under theirarc welder\u0027s tip. \\n\\n \\n\\n As if Fred could read his mind, he said, \"I need another twenty seconds, Chief.\"A volley of crystalline needles fired from one of the Elites peppered the sensor node. TheMaster Chief returned fire, but the Elite\u0027s camouflage kicked in and it faded from view. \\n\\n \\n\\n Another plasma bolt sizzled close to the hull, this one thirty meters to port. It was a riverof fire that lit the surface of Ascen.dant Justice like a dozen suns. John\u0027s shields drainedto a quarter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Okay, Chief,\" Fred told him, \"I\u0027m—\"ERIC NYLUND 223\"Incoming!\" Polaski cried over the COM. \\n\\n \\n\\n John turned to the dropship and saw a third plasma projectile materialize from the foldsof tangled Slipspace. This one skimmed a mere three meters over the hull—straighttoward them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will dived into the crux where the dropship met the hull. Fred and Grace hit the deck. Listood his ground and fired at the Elites, muzzle flash reflected in his helmet\u0027s faceplate.Anton rose from his limited cover on top of the dropship, but instinc.tively ducked againas an Elite took a shot at him. John crouched, jumped, and propelled himself into thesheltered area between the dropship\u0027s mandibles. \\n\\n \\n\\n The plasma blasted over the dropship like a tidal wave of fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n Polaski screamed, and her channel went silent.hannel went silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n Blue-white light filled John\u0027s vision, and electrical discharges jolted his flesh and buzzedthrough his muscles and ligaments. Temperature warnings blared. Boiling hydrostatic gelvented through his MJOLNIR armor\u0027s emergency ducts. \\n\\n \\n\\n Through blurry eyes, John saw the Covenant Elites flash va.porize. Downship, AscendantJustice\u0027s hull heated to a glowing yellow and softened. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the light and heat vanished, and the torrent of fire trailed aft like the tail of a comet. \\n\\n \\n\\n John craned his neck u , every muscle in his body screaming in pain. There was no traceof Li or Anton. The dropppship\u0027s hull was melted and distorted like a wax candle caught in ablow.torch\u0027s blast. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cockpit and Polaski were gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n His biosign warning blared. Will, Grace, and Fred lay next to him—dead or unconscious,he couldn\u0027t tell. He quickly attached their tethers to the deck, then clipped his own inplace. \\n\\n \\n\\n John keyed the COM. \"Admiral, conduit breach is sealed, sir.\"\"Hang on, son,\" Admiral Whitcomb replied. \"This might be a rough ride.\"John slumped to the deck unconscious. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30064.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
