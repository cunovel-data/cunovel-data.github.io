{"id":6832,"no":7,"title":"chapter 7","content":"1750 hours, September 22,2552 (Military Calendar) \\ Aboard unidentified Covenant flagship, uncharted system, Halo debris field. \n \n Plasma bolts impacted on the Longsword\u0027s hull and splashed across the windshield. The packets of glowing energy siz.zled across the cockpit and etched cloudy, molten trailsinto the glass. \n \n A legion of Grunts hunkered behind docked Seraph fighters and fuel pods. Some darted inand out of cover and fired ghostly green blobs of plasma at the Longsword. \n \n \"I got \u0027em,\" Polaski said and flipped a switch. \n \n The Longsword\u0027s landing gear deployed and raised the craft a meter off the floor. \"Guns clear,\" Polaski announced. \" \u0027Bye, boys.\"She brought up a targeting reticle and swept it around the bay. A hail of 120mm rounds tore through the Grunts\u0027 cover. Fuel pods and unshielded fighters detonated and sentmetal frag.ments and alien soldiers hurtling to the deck. The air exploded into roilingflame, which billowed toward the ceiling and then subsided. Pools of burning fuel and thecharred bodies of Grunts and Covenant Engineers littered the launch bay. \n \n \"Fire suppression system activating,\" Cortana said. \n \n Jets of gray mist blew down from above. The fires intensified for a moment, then gutteredand went out. \n \n \"Is there atmosphere in the bay?\" the Chief asked. \n \n \"Scanning,\" Cortana replied. \"Traces of ash, some contami.nation from the melted shiphulls, and a lot of smoke, but the air in the bay is breathable, Chief.\"ERIC NYLUND 59\"Good.\" He turned to the others. \"We\u0027re going in. I\u0027ll lead. Locklear, you\u0027re up with me.Sergeant, you\u0027ve got the rear.\"\"You\u0027ll need to take me, too,\" Cortana said. \"I\u0027ve pulled a schematic of this ship tonavigate, but the engineering controls have been manually locked down. I\u0027ll need directaccess to this ship\u0027s command data systems.\"The Chief hesitated. His armor allowed an AI like Cortana to tag along stored in a specialcrystal layer. On Halo, Cortana had been an invaluable tactical asset. \n \n Still, she also used part of his armor\u0027s neural interface for pro.cessing purposes, literallyharnessing parts of the Chief\u0027s brain. And after coming out of Halo\u0027s computer system,she\u0027d been act.ing... twitchy. \n \n He put his discomfort aside. If Cortana turned into a liability, he\u0027d pull the plug. \n \n \"Stand by,\" he said. He punched a key on the computer termi.nal and dumped Cortana toa data chip. A moment later the ter.minal pulsed green. \n \n He removed the chip and slotted it in the back of his helmet. There was a moment ofvertigo, and then the familiar mercury-and-ice sensation flooded his skull as Cortana interfaced. \n \n \"Still plenty of room in here, I see,\" she said. \n \n He ignored her customary quip and nodded at Johnson and Locklear. \"Let\u0027s go.\"Sergeant Johnson hit the door release, and the side hatch slid open. Locklear shoulderedhis rifle and poured fire through the opening. A pair of Grunts who had crouched near theLongsword to protect themselves from the fire flew backward onto the deck.Phosphorescent blood pooled beneath their prone forms. \n \n The Chief dived through the open hatch and rolled to his feet; his motion tracker pickedup three targets to his side. He whirled about and saw a trio of Covenant Engineers. He removed his fin.ger from the weapon\u0027s trigger. Engineers were no threat. \n \n The odd, meter-high creatures hovered above the deck, using bladders of some lighterthan-air gas produced by their bodies. Their tentacles and feelers probed a tangle of fuellines, quickly repairing the pipes and pumps. \n \n \"Funny that there\u0027s no welcoming committee yet,\" Cortana whispered. \"I looked over thisship\u0027s personnel roster: three60HALO: FIRST STRIKEthousand Covenant, mostly Engineers. There\u0027s a light company of Grunts, and only a hundred Elites.\"\"Only a hundred?\" the Chief muttered. \n \n He waved his team forward toward a heavy door at the back of the launch bay. The airwas full of smoke and fire-suppressing mist, which reduced visibility to a dozen meters. \n \n The rattle of assault rifle fire echoed through the bay. The Chief spun to his right and brought his own rifle to bear. \n \n Locklear stood over the twitching corpses of the Engineers. He fired another burst into the fallen aliens. \n \n \"Don\u0027t waste your ammunition, Corporal,\" the Sergeant said. \"They may be ugly, butthey\u0027re harmless.\"\"They\u0027re harmless now, Sarge,\" Locklear replied. He wiped a spatter of alien blood from his cheek and smirked. \n \n The Chief tended to agree with Locklear\u0027s threat analysis of the Covenant: When in doubt,kill. Still, he found the young Ma.rine\u0027s actions unnecessary... and a little sloppy. \n \n The architecture of the Covenant fighter bay was similar to the interior of the other Covenant ship the Chief had recently been inside, the Truth and Reconciliation. Low indirect lights illumi.nated the dark purple walls. The alien metal appeared to besten.ciled with odd, faintly luminescent geometric patterns that overlapped each other.The ceiling was vaulted and unneces.sarily high, maybe ten meters. In contrast to a human ship, it was a waste of space. \n \n The Chief spotted a large door at the back of the bay. \n \n The door was a distorted hexagonal shape and large enough that the entire team couldenter at the same time—not that he\u0027d ever be foolish enough to take up such a formation in hostile ter.ritory. The door had four sections that, when keyed to open, would silentlyslide away from the center. \n \n \"That will take us to the main corridor,\" Cortana said. \"And from there, to the bridge.\"The Chief waved Locklear to the right side of the door, Sergeant Johnson to the left. \n \n \"Lieutenant Haverson,\" he called out, \"you\u0027re our rear guard. Polaski, hit the door controls. Hand signals from now on.\"Haverson tossed an ironic salute to the Chief but tightened his grip on his weapon and scanned the bay. \n \n ERIC NYLUND 61Polaski moved forward and crouched by the panel in the mid.dle of the door. She turnedher cap around and leaned closer, then looked back to the Chief and gave him a thumbs-up. \n \n He raised his rifle and nodded, giving her the go-ahead to breach the door. \n \n She reached for the controls. Before she touched them, though, the door slid apart. \n \n Standing on the opposite side were five Elites: Two stood shielded by either edge of thedoor; a third stood centered in the corridor, plasma rifle leveled at the Chief; behind it,the fourth Elite covered the rear of their formation; and one last Elite crouched in front ofthe door control panel—nose to nose with Polaski. \n \n The Chief fired two bursts directly over Polaski\u0027s head. His first shots struck the Elite inthe middle of the corridor. His sec.ond burst hit the Elite standing rear guard. The alien warriors hadn\u0027t activated their shields, and 7.62mm rounds punctured their armor. The pair of Elites dropped to the deck. \n \n Their comrades on either side of the door howled and at.tacked. The whine of plasma rifle fire echoed through the bay as blue-white energy bolts crashed into the Chief\u0027s own shields. \n \n His shield dropped away, and the insistent drone of a warning indicator pulsed in hishelmet. His vision clouded from the flare of energy weapon discharges, and he struggledto draw a bead on the Elite in front of Polaski. It was no good—he had no clear shot. \n \n The Elite drew a plasma pistol. Polaski drew her own sidearm. \n \n She was faster—or luckier. Her pistol cleared its holster; she snapped it up and fired. The pistol boomed as a shot took the Elite right in the center of its elongated helmet. \n \n The Elite\u0027s own shot went wide and seared into the deck be.hind Polaski. \n \n Polaski emptied her clip into the alien\u0027s face. A pair of rounds rocked the alien back. Itsshields faded, and the remain.ing rounds tore through armor and bone. \n \n It fell on its back, twitched twice, and died. \n \n Johnson and Locklear unleashed a hellish crossfire into the corridor and made short workof the remaining Elites as Polaski hugged the deckplates. \n \n 62HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"Now that\u0027s what I\u0027m talkin\u0027 about,\" Johnson crowed. \"An honest-to-God turkey shoot.\"Ten meters down the passage a dozen more Elites rounded a corner. \n \n \"Uh-oh,\" Locklear muttered\"Sergeant,\" the Chief barked. \"\"Door control!John moved to Polaski\u0027s position in twoquick strides, grabbed her by her collar, and dragged her out of the line of fire. Plasmabolts singed the air where she\u0027d been. \n \n He dropped her, primed a grenade, and tossed it toward the rushing Elites. \n \n The Sergeant fired his assault rife at the door controls; they exploded in a shower ofsparks, and the doors slammed shut. \n \n A dull thump echoed behind the thick metal, then an eerie si.lence descended on the bay.Polaski struggled to her feet and fed a fresh clip into her pistol. Her hands shook. \n \n \"Cortana,\" the Chief said. \"We need an alternate route to the bridge.\"A blue arrow flashed on his heads-up display. The Chief turned and spotted a hatch to hisright. He pointed to the hatch and signaled his team to move, then ran to the hatch andtouched the control panel. \n \n The small door slid open to reveal a narrow corridor beyond, snaking into the darkness. \n \n He didn\u0027t like it. The corridor was too dark and too narrow—a perfect place for anambush. He briefly considered heading back to the primary bay door, but abandoned thatidea. Smoke and sparks poured from the door seams as the Covenant forces on the otherside tried to burn their way through. \n \n The Chief clicked on his low-light vision filters, and the dark.ness washed away into agrainy flood of fluorescent green. No contacts. \n \n He paused to let his shields recharge, then dropped into a low crouch. He brought his rifleto bear and crept into die corridor. \n \n The interior of the passage narrowed, and its smooth purple surface darkened. The Chiefhad to turn sideways to pass through. \n \n \"This looks like a service corridor for their Engineers,\" Cor.tana said. \"Their Elitewarriors will have a tough time follow.ing us.\"ERIC NYLUND 63The Chief grunted an acknowledgment as he eased his way through. There was a scrapingsound and a flash of sparks as his energy shield brushed the wall. It was too ti ht a fit. Hepowered down the shields, which left him just enough room to squeeze througggh. \n \n Locklear followed behind him, then Polaski, the Sergeant, and finally Haverson. \n \n The Chief pointed at Haverson, then at the door. The Lieu.tenant frowned, then nodded.Haverson closed the hatch and ripped out the circuitry for the control mechanism. \n \n There had been dozens of Engineers in the launch bay— and there were enough on theship to merit their own access tun.nel. The Chief hadn\u0027t seen anything like this on theTruth and Reconciliation. \n \n In fact, he hadn\u0027t seen a single Engineer on that ship. What made this ship different? Itwas armed like a ship of war... yet had the support staff of a refit vessel. \n \n \"Stop here,\" Cortana said. \n \n The Chief halted and killed his external speakers so he could speak freely. \"Problem?\"\"No. A lucky break, maybe. Look to your left and down twenty centimeters.\"The Chief squinted and noticed that a portion of the wall ex.truded into a circularopening no larger than the tip of his thumb. \"That\u0027s a data port... or what passes for onewith the Covenant Engineers. I\u0027m picking up handshake signals in shortwave and infraredfrom it. Remove me and slot me in.\"\"Are you sure?\"\"I can\u0027t do much good in there with you. Once I\u0027m directly in contact with the ship\u0027sbattlenet, however, I can infiltrate and take over their systems. You\u0027ll still need to get tothe bridge and manually give me access to their engineering systems. In the meantime, Imay be able to control secondary systems and buy you some time.\"\"If you\u0027re sure.\"\"When have I not been sure?\" she snapped. \n \n The Chief could sense her impatience through the neural interface. \n \n He removed Cortana\u0027s data chip from the socket in his helmet. \n \n 64 HALO: FIRST STRIKEThe Chief felt her leave his mind, felt the heat rush back into his head, pulsing with therhythm of his heart... and once again, he was alone in the armor. \n \n He slotted Cortana\u0027s chip into the Covenant data port. \n \n Locklear\u0027s face rippled with disgust, and he whispered, \"You couldn\u0027t pay me to stick anypart of myself in that thing.\"The Chief made a slashing gesture across his throat, and the Marine fell silent. \n \n \"I\u0027m in,\" Cortana said. \n \n \"How is it?\" the Chief said. \n \n There was a half-second pause\"\u0027\". Its ... different,Cortana replied. \"Proceed thirty meters down this passage and turn left.\"The Chief motioned the team forward. \n \n \"It\u0027s very different,\" Cortana murmured. \n \n Cortana was built for software intrusion. She had been pro.grammed with every dirtytrick and code-breaking algorithm the Office of Naval Intelligence, Section Three had ever created, and a few more tricks she\u0027d developed on her own. She was the ultimate thiefand electronic spy. She slipped into the Covenant system. \n \n It was easy the first time she had entered their network as the Longsword hadapproached the flagship. She had set their weap.ons systems into a diagnostic mode. The Covenant had deter.mined the problem and quickly reset the system, but it had given Polaski the precious seconds her sluggish human reflexes had needed to get inside thelaunch bay. \n \n \"How is it?\" the Chief asked. \n \n Now the element of surprise was gone, and the system\u0027s counterintrusion systems were running on high alert. Something else prowled the systems now. Delicate pings bouncedoff the edges of Cortana\u0027s presence; they probed, and withdrew. \n \n It felt as if there were someone else running through their sys.tem. A Covenant AI? There had never been any reports of alien AIs. The possibility intrigued her. \n \n \"It\u0027s.. . different,\" she finally answered. \n \n She scanned the ship\u0027s schematics, deck by deck, then flashed through the vessel\u0027s three thousand surveillance systems. She picked out the quickest route to the bridge from theircurrentERIC NYLUND 65position and stored it in a stolen tertiary system buffer. She multitasked a portion ofherself and continued to analyze the ship\u0027s structure and subsystems. \n \n \"Proceed thirty meters down this passage and turn left.\"Cortana hijacked the external ship cameras and detected the six Covenant cruisers. They had stalled their pursuit of the Longsword and now hovered a hundred kilometers off theflag.ship\u0027s starboard side. The strange U-shaped Covenant dropships launched from thecruisers and swarmed toward the flagship. That was trouble. \n \n Within the flagship she spotted a dozen hunt-and-kill Elite teams sweeping the corridors. \n \n She scrambled the ship\u0027s tracking systems, generated electronic ghosts of the Chief andhis team along a path directed toward the nose of the ship, where UNSC command-andcontrolcenters were typically located. Maybe she could fool the Elites into a wild goose chase. \n \n She uploaded the coordinates of those enemies into the Chief\u0027s HUD. \n \n A tickle of feedback teased through the data stream. \n \n Cortana locked onto the source of that feedback, listened, dis.cerned a nonrandom pattern to the signal, then cut off contact. She had no time to play hide and seek withwhatever else was in this system. \n \n Cortana had to finally admit to herself that she didn\u0027t have the power to contend with apossible enemy artificial construct. She had absorbed a tremendous volume of data from Halo\u0027s systems: eons\u0027 worth of records on Halo\u0027s engineering and maintenance, thexenobiology of the Flood, and every scrap of information on the mysterious \"Forerunners\" the Covenant revered so much. The information would take her a week ofnonstop processing to examine, collate, codify... let alone understand. \n \n Even compressed, all the data filled her and cut into optical subsystems that she usuallyreserved for her processing. She had a nagging suspicion that the file compression hadbeen too hasty—and that the Halo data might be corrupted. \n \n In effect, the vast amount of information she had copied bloated her, made her slower andless effective. \n \n She hadn\u0027t mentioned this to the Chief. She could barely ad.mit it to herself. Cortana was extremely proud of her intellect. \n \n 66 HALO: FIRST STRIKEBut to operate as if nothing were different would be even more foolish. \n \n She sent a blocking countersignal along the connection where this \"other\" was trying tocontact her. \n \n The portion of her consciousness examining the ship\u0027s struc.ture discovered that thebridge had another access point. Stupid. She should have seen it immediately, but thisother entrance had been filed under the schematics as an emergency system. It was a tinycorridor that connected to a set of escape pods. That route shared a vent with an engineering passage. \n \n \"Chief, there\u0027s another way to the bridge.\"\"Affirmative. Wait one.\" There was a burst of gunfire on the COM, then silence. \"Go ahead,Cortana.\"\"Uploading the route now,\" s\"he said. I do not believe you can fit through this newpassage in your armor. I suggest you split your team and proceed along both routes tomaximize your chances of egress onto the bridge.\"\"Understood,\" the Chief said. \"Polaski and Haverson with me. Johnson and Locklear, youtake the escape pod route.\"She continued to track both teams and the relative positions of the Covenant parties. Shereplicated additional ghost signals to confuse the enemy. \n \n Cortana picked up increasing communications bandwidth be.tween the flagship and thecruisers. Reports of the invaders—a call for help—a warning to be relayed to the homeworld. There were references to the \"holy one,\" and those messages had what sheconsidered amusing attempts at encryption to keep them se.cret. Curious, she had toinvestigate what the Covenant thought important enough to hide. \n \n As she decrypted those messa es and others cross-referenced and filed in their COMarchives, she detected an energggy spike on the flagship\u0027s lateral sensors. One cruiser off tostarboard moved farther away; it turned, its engines glowed, the black around it ri pledelectric blue. The Covenant ship sped forward, tore the night, and vanished into Slipppspace. \n \n Cortana noted their departure vector for future reference... a possible clue at the locationof their home world. \n \n It was puzzling that the Covenant would call for help. Their warriors were intenselyproud; they almost never ran from aERIC NYLUND67fight. They didn\u0027t ask for help... not for themselves. Then again, this ship, although armedfor war, didn\u0027t appear to be staffed for combat. It carried only a few hundred Elites and anarmy of Engineers. \n \n As Cortana pondered this, she continued to generate a counter-signal to match to therobe sent by the other presence in the system. She hoped to cloak her activity as long aspppossible. The other\u0027s signal morphed into a series of Bessel functions, and shecompensated to match. \n \n She automated this process, commandeering a portion of the Covenant\u0027s own NAVcomputer to do so, and then she herded the electronic ghosts of the Chief and the othersto confuse the pursuing Elite forces. \n \n At the same time, she continued her study of the Covenant ship and its systems—it was aunique opportunity. The informa.tion on their advanced Slipspace drive, their weapons—it could leapfrog human technology decades forward. \n \n \"Cortana?\" The Chief\u0027s voice broke her concentration. There were sounds of plasma boltsand automatic weapons fire. \"We\u0027ve got Elites in active camouflage in the passage. Weneed a way around this intersection.\"She had not considered the Elites\u0027 light-bending technology. She was doing too much,spreading herself too thin. She halted her ongoing study of the Covenant technology andfound the Chief a way around the intersection. \n \n She rebooted her human communications and protocol rou.tines and said, \"Access panelto your ri ht, Chief. Down three meters, straight ahead five meters, turn to your left andthen up agggain.\"She heard an explosion. \"Got it,\" the Chief said. \n \n Cortana had to focus on protecting the Chief. She halted her other searches andscrutinized the ship\u0027s schematics. There had to be something she could use. A weapon. Away to stop then-enemies—there: the backup terminus for their atmosphericpre.processors. Unlike the other systems, this one was classified as low priority and hadminimal security layers. \n \n She generated several hundred thousand Covenant codes in a microsecond and crackedthe system. She diverted the air vents along the corridors the Chief and his team occupiedto the pri68HALO: FIRST STRIKEmary air systems. She then tasked the processor pumps to ser.vice the rest of the shipand activated them—in reverse. \n \n Warnings flashed throughout the Covenant system as the pressure suddenly dropped in87 percent of the ship\u0027s passages. She squelched them. \n \n The other presence in the system tried to shut the pumps off. She blocked that signal andassigned a new code to the security systems: \"WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU.\"She heard the other AI scream, an echo of an echo that rever.berated through herprocessors. She knew trie sound—familiar like a human voice, but terribly distorted. \n \n She scanned through the ship\u0027s cameras and saw Grunts squeal and fall over, methane leaking from their breathers as the pres.sure dropped. Engineers turned blue, slowed,and died, floating in place with tentacles twitching, still searching for something to fix.The Elite hunt-and-destroy parties halted in the corridors and clutched their throats,mandibles snapping at air that was no longer there; they toppled and suffocated. \n \n An impulse flickered through her ethics subroutine and gen.erated an interruptcommand, designed to make her stop and re.think her decisions. But Cortana knew itwas either kill or be killed. She rerouted all signals from her ethics routine and shut itdown. She couldn\u0027t afford to be slowed down by such secondary considerations. \n \n \"Chief,\" she whispered over the COM. \"Be advised that the passages I\u0027m uploading into your NAV system no longer contain atmosphere. Proceeding into those regions will belethal to the rest of your team.\"There was a three-second pause, and then the Chief replied, \"Understood.\"Cortana\u0027s decryption of the Covenant communiques referenc.ing the \"holy one\" finallycycled to a halt. The language in them was unusually ornate—even more so than theflorid prose of the higher-ranking Elites. It was impossible to develop a literal translation,but she gleaned that some dignitary was due at the Halo construct. Soon. \n \n This visitor was so important that these warships were only the advance scouting party.More ships were on their way. Hun.dreds of them. \n \n ERIC NYLUND 69\"Chief,\" Cortana said. \"We may have a prob—\"\"Hold transmission, Cortana,\" the Chief interrupted. \"We\u0027re outside the command center.Can you tell how many are inside?\"\"Negative. They have disabled the bridge sensors,\" she replied. \n \n \"You heard Cortana,\" the Chief said, addressing his com.panions. \"Expect anything.Sergeant, you and Locklear: Get in position.\"\"Roger that,\" Sergeant Johnson whispered. \"In position and ready to kick Covenant ass.\"\"We\u0027re about to blow the door on this end, Cortana. Stand by.\"Cortana picked up energy surges on the flagship\u0027s lateral sen.sors. The Covenant cruisers turned; their plasma weapons warmed and readied to fire. \n \n \"Chief,\" Cortana said. \"Hurry!\"\"Plasma grenades on my mark,\" the Chief said on the COM. \"Mark! Toss them and takecover.\"The Chief tossed two plasma grenades. They burned magnesium-brilliant and adhered tothe heavy alloy of the bulk.head doors that encased the bridge—one of the alien weapons\u0027 more useful properties. He moved around the corner of the pas.sage and shielded Haverson and Polaski. \n \n Five seconds elapsed, and a flash filled the hallway. The Chief moved back to the doors.They shone mirror-bright where the grenade had detonated but were otherwise unharmed. \n \n A hundred grenades wouldn\u0027t have blasted through these doors—but when Covenant plasma grenades detonated, they disrupted electronics and shielding. The Chief dug hisgauntleted fingers into the door crack— hoping that the disruption had knocked out themotors and shielding keeping these doors closed. \n \n He braced himself and tried to pull the doors apart at the seams. They slid a few centimeters, then ground to a halt. The Chief adjusted his footing and strained at them again, but the doors remained frozen in place. \n \n The Chief\u0027s motion sensors pulsed a warning—there was movement directly on the other side of the door. \n \n He shoved the muzzle of his assault rifle into the narrow open.ing and squeezed thetrigger. Spent shell casings clattered to the floor. \n \n 70HALO: FIRST STRIKEA howl echoed from the other side, and a curl of gray smoke drifted through the crack. \n \n The Chief slung his rifle, grabbed the doors, flexed, pulled— and this time the heavy metalmoved. \n \n A flash of plasma fire washed over his shields, blinding him. He ignored it, closed his eyes,and continued to force his way through the door. Another plasma shot struck him in thechest. \n \n The doors were half a meter apart—good enough. \n \n He rolled to the side and gave his shields a moment to regenerate. \n \n Nothing. The suit\u0027s alarms pulsed insistently. He squinted through the glowing spots thatswam in his vision and scanned the damage report—the MJOLNIR\u0027s internal temperaturewas over sixty degrees Celsius, and the Chief heard the whine of microcompressors in hisarmor, trying to compensate. \n \n \"Marines!\" he yelled. \"Suppressing fire!\"\"Hell yes, Master Chief,\" Locklear replied. Locklear dropped to one knee and fired throughthe opening; Johnson stood and fired over the younger Marine\u0027s head. \n \n The Chief rebooted his shielding control software. \n \n Nothing. His shield system was dead. \n \n The shooting stopped. \"I\u0027m out,\" Locklear said. \n \n \"And I\u0027m in,\" the Chief said. \n \n . He rushed into the room and stepped over the dead Elite on the floor before him. Itstorso had been ripped open—shot as it tried to hold the doors closed. \n \n The Chief scanned the room. It was circular, twenty meters across, with a raised platform in the center that was ten meters across and ringed with holographic control surfaces.The central platform floated over a pit in the floor. Within the pit were ex.ploded opticalconduits and a trio of Covenant Engineers, cow.ering in fear. \n \n \"Don\u0027t shoot the Engineers,\" Cortana warned. \"We need them.\"\"Understood,\" the Chief replied. \"Acknowledge that order, Locklear.\"There was a pause over COM and then Locklear said, \"Roger.\"Along the circular walls, floor-to-ceiling displays showed the flagship\u0027s status as a varietyof charts and graphs, peppered withERIC NYLUND 71the odd calligraphy of the Covenant. They also showed the space surrounding them, andthe five remaining Covenant cruisers closing in. \n \n The Chief caught a motion in his peripheral vision: An Elite in jet-black armor materialized from the wall display, its light-bending camouflage dissolving. It strodetoward the Chief, roar.ing a challenge. \n \n The Chief\u0027s rifle snapped up, and he squeezed the trigger. Three rounds spat from themuzzle, then the bolt locked open. The ammo counter read oo—empty. \n \n The shots flared on the Elite\u0027s shielding; a lucky round pene.trated and deformed itsshoulder. Purple-black blood spattered on the deck, but it shrugged off the wound andkept coming. \n \n Haverson charged into the room and leveled his pistol. \"Hold it!\" he yelled, and thumbedoff the weapon\u0027s safety. \n \n The Elite drew a plasma pistol and fired at the Lieutenant— but never took its eyes offthe Chief. \n \n Haverson cursed and scrambled out of the room as the plasma charge slashed at him. \n \n The Chief altered his grip on the rifle and crouched in a low fighting stance. Even with theshield malfunction, he was confi.dent he could take a single Elite. \n \n The Elite removed its helmet and dropped it. The plasma pis.tol clattered to the deck amoment later. It leaned forward, and its mandibles parted in what the Chief guessed hadto be a smile. It moved closer, and a blue- white blade of energy flashed to life in its hands. \n \n The Elite raised the energy blade and charged. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30047.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
