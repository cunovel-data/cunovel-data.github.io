{"id":6842,"no":17,"title":"chapter 17","content":"1002 hours, July 14,2523 (Military Calendar)\\Epsilon Eridani system, planet Reach,Spartan training exercise. Twenty-nine years ago. \n \n John crawled forward and peered over the edge of the rise. A lush, green valley stretchedout below him. In the distance, the silvery reflections of the Big Horn River twistedthrough the thick forest. Aside from a flock of birds that wheeled overhead, there was noactivity below. He inched back to a blackened, hol.low tree stump and crawled inside. \n \n Fred and Linda sat inside the hollowed-out cedar stump. It muffled their conversationsand insulated them from the sol.diers\u0027 thermal goggles. \"It\u0027s all clear for now,\" hewhispered. A moment later Sam, Kelly, and Fhajad appeared, ghostlike, from theircamouflaged positions nearby. They crouched outside the cedar stump and watched forpatrols. \n \n From a distance they looked like soldiers on field maneuvers. Each was tall, fit, and agile,and looked to be in their late teens or early twenties. Closer observation told a differentstory. Each Spartan was no more than twelve years old. \n \n \"Weapons check,\" John told Fred and Linda. \"We can\u0027t afford any mistakes on this one,especially not with the rifles.\"Linda and Fred disassembled and inspected their SRS99C-S2 sniper rifles—which they\u0027dliberated from a pair of Tango Com.pany shooters who\u0027d been sent to hunt them downtwo days ago. If the soldiers of Tango Company didn\u0027t capture them and beat them intounconsciousness—this would be fun. \n \n John checked his pistol. CPO Mendez had issued the weapon. It used compressed air tofire a narq-dart. The effective range158HALO: FIRST STRIKEwas twenty meters, and on impact it could drop a rhino in its tracks. \n \n Twenty meters wouldn\u0027t cut it for this mission, though, so Fhajad had modified the114mm APFSDS rounds from the sniper rifles, removed their deadly armor-piercing tips,and re.placed them with narq-dart capsules. \n \n When Linda had test-fired the weapon, she promised John ac.curacy to one hundredmeters. The rounds would penetrate flesh, but they couldn\u0027t kill anyone—not unless shehit the temple or eyes. \n \n \"Okay,\" John said, \"this is supposed to be a training exercise, but this is the seventh timeChief Mendez has made us play with Tango Company.\"\"They\u0027re getting pretty tired of losing,\" Fred remarked with a wry smile. \n \n \"That\u0027s not a good thi ,\" Linda told him and flipped a stray strand of red hair out of herface. \"They\u0027re not goingngng to play fair. You heard the sniper we captured. He said that thistime their Captain told them to win no matter what—even if they had to bloody a few ofus to do it.\"John nodded. \"So we\u0027ll return the favor and do whatever it takes to win, too.\" He grabbeda twig and scratched a square in the leaf-covered dirt. \"I\u0027ll have command of Red Team: \n \n That\u0027s me, Sam, Kelly, and Fhajad. Linda, you lead Blue Team.\" hajad. Linda, you lead Blue Team.\"\"It\u0027s not \u0027Blue Team,\u0027 \" Fred complained, and his face soured. \"It\u0027s just me. How come Ihave to stay and play sniper?\" He flexed his hands, and John could sense his pent-up eagerness to get into close-range combat. \n \n \"Because you\u0027re our second-best shot,\" John told him. \"Andwov ob€\u003e.. \n \n ob€\u003e..**. — .— JERIC NYLUND159\"Count on it,\" Linda replied and locked her dark green eyes with John\u0027s. \n \n He wondered if that\u0027s what her eyes looked like when she sighted through the sniper scope. She never seemed to blink; she always won in games of stare-down. \n \n \"After we get the flag,\" he continued, \"Red Team will get out of there. Watch for targets ofopportunity and cover us. We ren.dezvous at the LZ and hopefully no one finds us before then.\"Fred nodded. Linda hefted her new rifle, which was almost too large for her to lookthrough the scope and rest the butt against the hollow of her shoulder at the same time.\"You\u0027ll be in good hands.\"John closed his eyes and ran over the details of his plan again in his head. Yes— everything gelled; their odds were good. He knew they\u0027d win. \n \n \"Don\u0027t come out from hiding at the LZ until I give the all-clear signal,\" he reminded them.\"We could be captured... they could make us talk.\"They all nodded, remembering what Tango Company had done to James. He \"fell down a flight of stairs\" as they had escorted him from cell to cell in their single-story jail. James hadn\u0027t bro.ken ... not mentally, at least. But John wished he had; it had taken James a whole week to recover. \n \n No—he took back that thought. He was glad James hadn\u0027t broken. John would have triedto do the same. \n \n John whistled the little six-note singsong tune Deja had taught them—their all-clear signal. He stood, holstered his dart pistol, and checked the three stun grenades on hisbelt. \"I\u0027ll see you at the LZ.\"160HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"Okay. Check your mirrors.\"They all pulled out the shards of mirror they had taken from Tango Company\u0027s latrine lastnight. They had taped the edges so they could be handled more easily, and taped theirbacks to re.duce the chance they\u0027d shatter. The whole operation depended on a fragilepiece of glass, which had John worried. \n \n \"Just hand signals from here on out,\" John told them. \"Move out, Red Team.\"They crouched and clawed and slithered through the forest until they reached a graveltrack. They pushed two large rocks off the nearby hill, blocking the road, then waited inthe brush. \n \n Headlights appeared as a supply truck rumbled down the road and squealed to a halt.Two soldiers got out and scanned the area. \n \n \"Think it\u0027s an ambush?\" one of them muttered and gripped his rifle tighter. \n \n \"From those freak Section Three kids? Jesus, I don\u0027t know,\" the driver said. \"Screw therules of this exercise.\" He pulled a Kevlar poncho over his head. \"I\u0027m not gonna take a dartin my ass if it is. Cover me.\"The man riding shotgun got out and walked around the truck. \"Looks clear,\" hewhispered. \"Hurry.\"The driver jumped out of the cab, moved to the rocks, and rolled them off the road. \n \n John ran from the brush and crawled under the vehicle. He pulled himself up and wedgedtight against the undercarriage, close enough that he smelled the rubber from the new tires. Kelly and Sam came next; Fhajad was last. \n \n They hadn\u0027t been spotted. So far, so good. \n \n The two men got back into the truck and proceeded down the dirt road. \n \n Gravel bounced up and caught John in the side of the head, and cut him; blood trickledfrom his ear along his neck, but he didn\u0027t dare loosen his grip. \n \n After a kilometer of being pelted by rocks and stung by sand, the truck eased to a halt atTango Company\u0027s base. The guard at the gatehouse spoke to the driver, and they laughed.The guard then walked around and opened the back of the truck. \n \n John squirmed and got his mirror ready. With a flick of his hand, he signaled the others todo the same. John held his mirrorERIC NYLUND161at an angle pointed at the undercarriage of the truck. His hand trembled but he forcedhimself to be steady. He had to. \n \n The gate guard approached the truck with a long pole and a small mirror attached at one end. He stuck the mirror under the truck and swept it along one side. \n \n John matched the position of the mirror with his, moved it steady along as the gate guardpassed him so all the guard saw was the reflected image of the undercarriage—a meter toJohn\u0027s left. \n \n They\u0027d practiced this maneuver all last night. It had to be perfect. \n \n The guard moved on to Sam\u0027s position, and then Fhajad\u0027s, and finally to Kelly\u0027s corner ofthe truck. \n \n Kelly\u0027s mirror slipped and she fumbled—caught it just before it hit the ground. John heldhis breath; Kelly barely got the re.flective surface in place as the gate guard swept her section. \n \n \"Go ahead,\" the guard said and rapped the side of the truck. \"You\u0027re clean.\"\"How are the dogs?\" the driver asked. \n \n \"Still sick,\" the guard muttered. \"Not sure what the heck they all ate last night, but they\u0027re still squirting.\"\"Damn,\" the driver said. He started the engine and rolled into Tango Company\u0027s base camp. \n \n Last night Fred had fed the guard dogs a paste made of a few squirrels they\u0027d caught,some unripe berries, and the antibacter.ial ointment in their first-aid kits—a concoction guaranteed to keep Tango\u0027s dogs out of the picture for another day. \n \n The truck parked inside a warehouse. Two men came and un.loaded the back and then left, locking the doors of the warehouse behind them. \n \n John and the others finally eased themselves down from the truck. None of them spoke. Asingle word overheard now could blow the entire operation. They silently massaged theiraching muscles. John bandaged his ear to stop the bleeding. \n \n John ointed to Sam and then at the hood of the truck. Sam nodded and got to work. Johnthen pppointed at Fhajad and to the side door. Fhajad moved to the entrance and began topick the lock. \n \n 162HALO: FIRST STRIKEJohn and Kelly patrolled the warehouse, looking for cameras, dogs, guards, anythingthey\u0027d have to remove. It was clear. \n \n Sam returned with four canteens, which he had, according to their plan, filled withbattery acid from the truck. \n \n There was a click from the side door and Fhajad gave them a thumbs-up. They gatherednear the door. Fhajad eased it open, peeked out the crack, then opened it a little more andglanced to either side. \n \n He nodded and moved out, keeping well away from the over.head lights, skirting theshadows of the warehouse. \n \n John and the others followed, pausing in the darkest part of the shadows. John held upfive fingers, and Sam passed out the canteens of acid. John pointed to his watch and againflashed five fingers. \n \n They nodded. \n \n John then pointed to Kelly, and with two fingers pointed to the perimeter of the camp andmade a guillotine-cutting mo.tion onto his other hand. Kelly nodded and vanished intothe darkness. \n \n Sam and Fhajad moved off as well, making their way to the barracks houses they hadpreviously reconnoitered. There was a crawl space under each building. \n \n John sprinted to the farthest barracks and slipped underneath. He paused for a moment,listening for any noise, a footfall, an alarm—it was still quiet. They were undetected...which would last for only another five minutes. \n \n He took three sticks of chewing gum from his pocket, popped them into his mouth, andchewed. John crawled to the center of the building. He carefully took a rag from his shirtpocket, poured acid onto it, and then dabbed the rag to the underside of the wood floor.He was extremely careful not to soak the rag or get any acid on himself. When he touchedthe rag to the ply.wood, the wood smoldered. \n \n After he had soaked a meter-square patch, he checked his watch. Thirty seconds until itwas 0455. Just enough time. He primed all three of his stun grenades, set their timers forfive minutes, then used the chewing gum to attach the grenades to the perimeter of theacid-weakened section of floor. \n \n Normally the stun grenades couldn\u0027t penetrate centimeter-thickERIC NYLUND 163plywood. Once the acid had eaten through the porous fibers, however, the three grenades would have more than enough bang to turn that meter-square section into a million airborne splinters—shot straight up into the sleeping quarters of Tango Company. Notlethal ... but guaranteed to be one heck of a distraction. \n \n John crawled out, crept back to the warehouse, and ren.dezvoused with the rest of RedTeam. \n \n John glanced at his watch: 0458. \n \n He pointed to Kelly and then to himself, then made a curling motion around one side ofthe warehouse. He pointed to Sam and Fhajad and motioned them around the oppositeside. They moved to the far corners of the building. \n \n John and Kelly crouched and waited. They had a perfect view of the center of the camp,the calisthenics area, the parade grounds, and—right in the center—the flagpole. \n \n Right on time a Corporal and two guard escorts marched out and unfolded their green-striped flag. He attached one corner to a lanyard dangling from the pole. \n \n John glanced at the distant forest. The woods past the fence of Tango Company\u0027s camp had been clear-cut. He knew it was more than a hundred meters—closer to two hundred.There was no guarantee that Fred or Linda could hit anything at that range. \n \n He drew his dart pistol and clicked off its safety. \n \n At 0500 flashes of light strobed beneath the barracks as the grenades detonated. There was the crackle of wood and the screams of the men and women ofTango Company. \n \n The Corporal attaching the flag dropped one end and whirled around. Floodlights on theperimeter fence snapped on and pointed inward toward the barracks. \n \n In the confusion, no one noticed as one of the guards near the flagpole dropped his rifle,grabbed his neck ... and toppled to the gravel face-first. \n \n His partner spotted him and knelt. \n \n John sprinted across the compound, firing. His first shot went wild, and the kneelingguard spun around to face him. Fhajad and Sam shot him in the back. \n \n John took aim at the Corporal—who fumbled with his pistol164HALO: FIRST STRIKEholster, trying to free his weapon. John planted two narq-darts in his chest. The Corporaldropped. \n \n Two more guards rounded the corner of the warehouse, shouted, and took aim at John. \n \n He was out in the open, and there was no way his dart pistol could hit those guards fromthis distance. \n \n One guard fired. The round pinged off the flagpole not five centimeters from John\u0027s head. \n \n The guard stiffened and dropped his rifle, wildly grabbing at the back of his head ... andthe dart stuck into his skull. He screamed and fell, thrashing in the dirt. \n \n The other guard twitched and pulled a dart from his thigh. An.other dart hit him in thechest, and he sprawled to the ground. \n \n John sent his silent thanks to Linda and Fred. He detached the flag from the lanyard andstuffed it into his shirt. \n \n He waved Red Team forward, and Kelly led them to the fences. \n \n Kelly didn\u0027t slow down as she sprinted and closed on the chain-link fence. She tucked andthrew herself into the steel mesh. Just before she hit, John spotted the smoking outlineson the fence where she had applied the battery acid. \n \n The fence broke in a jagged outline, and Kelly rolled to her feet on the other side withoutmissing a stride. John waved his team through. He went last, pausing only a fraction of asecond to look back. \n \n The camp was in chaos. Security lights swung about, there were screams from thebarracks. A tank rumbled to life and crunched into the center of the base. \n \n John ran. Behind them came the staccato report of machine-gun fire—just as they enteredthe safety of the forest. \n \n John smiled, panting. \"Good work, everyone,\" he whispered. \"I think those guys wereusing live ammo this time.\"Kelly held up a brass case from a 7.62mm round. \"Yep,\" she said. \"No doubt.\"\"Come on,\" John said, \"let\u0027s not stick around. If they weren\u0027t before, they\u0027re pissed now.\"Red Team slinked through the forest. They kept to the shad.ows, and took cover underlogs when a Pelican roared overhead looking for them. \n \n ERIC NYLUND 165At 0545 they made it to the clearing designated as their ex.traction LZ. At 0700 hoursthe were supposed to meet CPO Mendez. Of course, the Chief rarely let them get off thiseasyyy— so John had planned for Blue Team to be here as well... only they would remainhidden. Linda and Fred would post some.where in the treetops and cover Red Team untilthey were sure it was safe. \n \n Red Team hunkered down in the brush and waited. They weren\u0027t safe; John knew that.Tango Company would be looking for them, and this is when his team would getanxious ... when they would want to talk and brag about their successful mission, or lookat the captured flag. To their credit, Red Team stayed still and silent. And Blue Team wasnowhere to be seen. \n \n At 0610 the thunderous roar of a Pelican\u0027s engines filled the air and the craft slowlydescended and landed in the clearing. The aft hatch popped open. \n \n Fhajad started to move, but John set his hand on his shoulder. \n \n \"Too early,\" he whispered. \"When is the Chief not perfectly on time?\"Fhajad, Kelly, and Sam grimly nodded. \n \n \"I\u0027ll go,\" John said. \"You guys back up Blue Team.\"They gave him a thumbs-up. Sam patted him on the back and whispered, \"Don\u0027t worry, Iwon\u0027t let them do anything to you.\"\"I know,\" John whispered back. He pulled the flag from his shirt and handed it to Sam.\"Thanks.\"John crawled away from their position. When he was thirty meters from his team, hestood and approached the Pelican— which was almost certainly a trap. \n \n He halted halfway across the meadow and waited. \n \n A figure appeared on the exit ramp of the Pelican and waved him forward. \"Come on, son.Haul ass!\"\"Negative, sir!\" John shouted. \n \n The figure turned and muttered to someone inside, \"Crap.\" He sighed. \"Okay, so we do itthe hard way.\"Four men jogged out of the back of the Pelican. They quickly spread out in a semicircleand moved toward John, their assault rifles aimed directly at him. \n \n \"He\u0027s giving up,\" one of the soldiers said disbelievingly. \n \n John held up his hands. \n \n 166HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"Should we just shoot him?\" another man said. \n \n \"No,\" the one leading them hissed. \"Payback first.\" He stepped up to John and punchedhim in the stomach. \n \n John doubled over from the blow. \n \n The man hauled him up and patted him down. \"We gotta find that damned flag or theCaptain will have our asses in a sling. Where is it, kid?\" He shook John. \"And where\u0027s therest of your pack?\"John laughed. \n \n \"What\u0027s so funny?\" the man growled. \n \n \"You idiots are bunched up.\"A hail of darts hissed through the air from all sides. The men from the Pelican convulsed;one fired his rifle, but the shot went wide and high. They fell over, paralyzed. \n \n John dropped to a crouch, grabbed a pistol from the man who\u0027d punched him, andcrawled on his stomach to the Pelican. He crept around the open hatch and swept theinterior. Empty. \n \n He scrambled into the cockpit and pulsed the Pelican\u0027s radar. He got a contact bearing of110, fourteen kilometers out, but it moved on a parallel course to their position. John leftthe Pelican and ran across the field. \n \n Red and Blue Teams were still hidden... and they would stay hidden forever, until he gavethe all-clear. \n \n Their all-clear signal wasn\u0027t something that could be wrung from John—not even tortureor CPO Mendez\u0027s best coercion techniques would wrest it from him. He would ratherhave died than betray his teammates. \n \n John whistled the singsong six-note melody and called: \"Oly Oly Oxen Free!\"Red Team emerged first and marched across the meadow. Kelly paused to kick one of themen in the head; she took his ri.fle, too. \n \n Linda and Fred dropped down from a tree branch and ran across the field. \"Oly Oly OxenFree,\" Linda repeated, grinning from ear to ear. \"All out in the free. We\u0027re all free.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30057.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
