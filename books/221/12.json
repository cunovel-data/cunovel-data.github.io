{"id":6837,"no":12,"title":"SECTION 2DEFENSE OF CASTLE BASE CHAPTER 12","content":"0744 hours, August 30,2552 (Military Calendar)\\Epsilon Eridani system, Longhorn Valley, planet Reach. Five days ago. Steamy clouds parted like a drawn curtain; a fireball one hun.dred meters across roaredover Fred and Kelly\u0027s position. Fred traced the line of flames back through the sky andspotted the faint outlines of dozens of Covenant warships in low orbit. Fred\u0027s Banshee skimmed over the treetops, down the mountain.side. He pushed the craftto its maximum speed. Kelly followed, and they swooped into a valley and up onto thezigzagging ridge-line where Joshua had first spotted the Covenant invasion force. He put aside thoughts of his fallen comrade. He had to focus on keeping his remaining team members alive. Fred called up the mapping system on his heads-up display. A blue NAV marker, nestledin the crux of topological lines, identi.fied their fallback position: ONI Section Three\u0027ssecure-and-secret research facility buried under Menachite Mountain. Two decades ago ithad been a titanium mine, and then the abandoned tunnels were used as storage untilSection Three had taken over the mountain for their own purposes. \"We\u0027ll need to find a safe route through—\"A hail of purple-white crystalline shards hissed through the air, arcing up from the forestbeneath them. Each shard looked like the projectile fired by a Covenant needier—but far larger. The shard that slashed past Fred\u0027s cockpit was the size of his forearm. Kelly dodged one projectile, which exploded in midair. Needle-like fragments bouncedfrom the Banshee\u0027s fuselage. ERIC NYLUND 109One tiny secondary fragment impaled Fred\u0027s Banshee and detonated. The port canard ofhis flier deformed from the explo.sion, and the craft wobbled. \"Down!\" he shouted, but Kelly was already a dozen meters below him and plummeting toa distant dry riverbed. He fol.lowed, trailing smoke. Fred confirmed his position and guided his wounded Banshee onto a course that followedthe flash-dried riverbed below. The path wound through the forest, and sinewed close toMenachite Mountain. With luck, they could ditch the Banshees and make a short run to the ONI facility. Overhead, tangerine borealis pulsed from the north. Sheets of silver crackled across thesky, and the black clouds boiled, lit by the raging fires beneath them. They piled into thunderheads and spat lightning. The massive warships that had been overhead moments ago ac.celerated back into theupper atmosphere. Their engines screamed and left blistering wakes across the swollen sky. For a split second panic seized Fred\u0027s throat. Then his training kicked in and his mindturned cold and metallic, and filtered through every fact he had on Covenant plasma bombardments. He had to think or die. So he thought. Something didn\u0027t fit. Covenant plasma bombardment had al.ways proceeded in an orderly crisscrossing pattern across a planet until every square centimeter of the surface was glass and cinder. The ships above hadn\u0027t finished their work here. He risked a glance to the left and right. One hundred thousand hectares of forest—thesame forest that Fred and his fellow Spartans had trained in since childhood—was beingdevoured by walls of flame. Coils of heat and thick black smoke spiraled into the sky. A wave passed over Fred and Kelly—he couldn\u0027t see it, but he felt it: A thousand ants hadgotten into his armor and bitten him. Static fuzzed his display, and then vanished withapop. His shields dropped to zero and then slowly started to recharge. The grav pods on their fliers flickered and sputtered. \"EMP,\" Kelly shouted over the COM. \"Or some plasma effect.\"110HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"Hard landing,\" Fred ordered. Kelly made an unhappy sound over the COM and snapped it off. They plummeted out of the sky, gliding with what little aero.dynamics and power remained in their Banshees. Fred nosed his craft over the steaming rocks of the dry riverbed. He picked a path between boulders and jagged granite fangs, pointed toward aribbon of gravel. There was just one problem: A pair of these rocks were slightly darker than the others . ..and they moved. The creatures were huge and heavily armored and moved with slow, deliberate precision. Each held a massive metal plate like a shield. Fred hit the COM and yelled, \"Heads up!Covenant Hunters dead ahead!\" There was no time to evade the new threat. The nearestHunter wheeled to face them, and the array of sen.sory pins along its back flared,anemone-like. The hulking crea.ture raised its main weapon—a powerful fuel rod gun,mounted on its arm—at Fred. The barrel pulsed green. The Hunter fired. Fred killed the power, and his Banshee dropped ten meters. There was a flash as the orbof destructive energy split the air where his flier had been a second before. The Banshee hit the ground, skidding through fist-sized rocks. The battered craft flippedand tossed him to the ground. The Banshee rolled end over end and crashed into theHunter. The massive alien brought up its thick, metal shield and shrugged off the wreckage as if itwere cardboard. The fuel rod gun began to charge again. Fred winced and rolled to his feet, ignoring the new pain the crash landing had caused. Heneeded a weapon. Pain would have to wait. The Hunter lumbered toward him, then dropped into a crouch and charged ahead atterrifying speed. There was a crackle of static on his COM frequency, and Fred heard one word: \"Duck!\"He threw himself onto the ground and rolled to the side. Kelly\u0027s riderless flier soared over him and collided with the Hunter at full speed. TheBanshee exploded and showered the area with glittering metal fragments. ERIC NYLUND111The Hunter reeled as fire washed across its armor. It moved in slow, confused circles. Fred could see the bright orange smears of the Hunter\u0027s blood staining the rocks. Kelly landed on her feet next to Fred. She readied a captured plasma grenade and hurledit straight toward the second Hunter\u0027s huge gun. It lodged in the barrel of the weapon and detonated. Tendrils of energy covered theHunter. The gun crackled and belched smoke. Fred got to his feet. \"Run!\"They weren\u0027t going to engage a Hunter in hand-to-hand com.bat. They might lose—theymight win, but in the meantime the rest of the Covenant ground forces would catch up tothem. They sprinted toward a tiny patch of forest ahead, perhaps the last trees standing onReach. The Hunter, confused with its de.stroyed weapon—and its flame-wreathedpartner—hesitated, not sure what to do. \"Didn\u0027t you see while we were airborne?\" Kelly said, concern tightening her voice. \"There\u0027s about half the entire Covenant as.sault force just ahead.\"\"Ground troops?\" Fred said, boosting his speed to a full sprint. \"How far?\"\"Haifa klick.\"That didn\u0027t make sense, either. Why have forces groundside when you were destroyingthe planet from orbit? \"Something\u0027s not right,\" he told her. \"Let\u0027s see what they\u0027re up to.\"Kelly\u0027s acknowledgment light winked red. \"They\u0027re between us and the fallback point,\" Fred told her. \"We have to.\"They entered the stand of trees, paused, and looked back. The Hunter shambled afterthem, but it was a futile pursuit. Despite their occasional bursts of speed, the Hunterswere too slow. They were caught between Covenant forces on the ground and those in the air, andneither Fred nor Kelly voiced the one question foremost on their minds: Was there even afallback po.sition left? Or had the Covenant between them and the rest of their teamfound and destroyed them? The COM crackled.\"—is Gamma Team, Alpha. Come in.\"Fred replied, \"Gamma, this is Alpha. Go ahead.\"112HALO: FIRST STRIKEThere was a roar of static. \"Whitcomb ... too many. Got— you read?\"\"Gamma,\" Fred shouted. \"The fallback is hot. Repeat hot! Acknowledge.\"There was only static. \"I hope they heard,\" he told Kelly. \"Red-21 can take care of his team. Don\u0027t worry.\" She crept forward and waved him tofollow. \"Take a look at this.\"Fred glanced over his shoulder. No Hunter, and nothing on his motion detector. Hefollowed Kelly, and parted a wall of black.berry brambles. Parked in a clearing wereCovenant vehicles, lined in three rows of four: mortar tanks. The tanks had two widelateral fins, beneath which were armored antigrav pods. They were extremely stable andfired the Covenant\u0027s most powerful ground weapon: the energy mortar. Fred had seenthem in ac.tion; they fired an encapsulated blob of plasma that obliterated everythingwithin twenty meters of impact. Titanium battle plate, concrete, or flesh—it all vaporized. Marines called these tanks \"Wraiths\" because you usually got one look at them beforethey made you one. There were a handful of Grunts milling about the tanks, as well as dozens of the floatingCovenant Engineers. The Engi.neers swarmed over and under the machinery. Mostinteresting to Fred, the vehicles\u0027 hatches were open. \"I can\u0027t think of a better disguise,\" Kelly whispered, \"than five tons of Covenant armor.\" She started forward. Fred set his hand on her arm, holding her back. \"Wait. Think it through. There are twopossibilities. First, if the Covenant have found the fallback position, we go in guns blazingand carve a path for Delta Team to get out.\"She nodded. \"The other possibility?\"\"They don\u0027t know that Delta Team is holed up under the mountain. Then—\" Fredhesitated. \"Then we have to draw them away.\"Kelly considered this, then said, \"I was afraid you were going to say that.\" She gave thedirt a tiny kick. \"But you\u0027re right.\"A blip appeared on their motion trackers, directly on their six. The contact was large andmoving steadily toward them. TheERIC NYLUNO 113Hunter must have made up its mind—come to find them and stomp them into the ground. \"Move,\" Fred whispered. The crossed the field, quickly and silently, and the Grunts never saw them. Fred andKellyyy reached the smooth-surfaced Wraith tanks. He gave Kelly a go signal, and shesprang into the nearest open hatch. A moment later Fred inched ahead to the next tankand eased inside. He sealed the hatch behind him. This was one of the most desperate and stupid decisions he had ever made. How werethey going to take on an entire Cove.nant invasion force with a pair of tanks—especially tanks they hadn\u0027t a clue how to operate? \"Red-One,\" Kelly said over the COM. \"Ready when you are.\"Fred examined the dim interior. Directly ahead was a seat, constructed with the same mottled purple metal as the Banshees. Fred settled his bulk onto it. It was too high; hehad to stand in a half crouch. Holographic control surfaces and displays sprang into theair before him and showed a 360-degree view. Through the armored shell he felt the rumble and roar of Kelly\u0027s tank starting. Fred didn\u0027t understand any of the symbols, yet something seemed familiar about them.Some of the controls were similar to the Banshee, but nothing was an exact match. He relaxed as best he could given the situation, and his hands drifted over the controls. He tapped a symbol that could have been Aztec iconog.raphy, a tangle of spaghetti, or a crisscross of bird tracks. His tank coughed and rumbled and rose a meter off the ground. Fred frowned. He\u0027d been damned lucky to get it right the first time. That was more than luck—-just as it was more than luck that he knew that the controls under his left handmoved the tank, the ones under his right aligned the mortar on target, and the one in thecenter armed and fired the main battery. But Fred wasn\u0027t going to examine how he knew this. He\u0027d just use this cu.rious development to his advantage. \"Ready here,\" he told Kelly. \"Let\u0027s take out the motor pool.\"\"Affirmative,\" she said, trying to conceal the faint trace of an.ticipation in her voice. 114HALO: FIRST STRIKEIn unison the Spartans turned and fired at the far corner of the formation of tanks. Two blue-white blobs of liquid sun spat from the Wraiths and detonated. There was a dazzlinglight, an expan.sion of superheated white fire—and then there was glass-smooth ground and the smoldering skeletons of seven Wraith tanks. More luck. If the tanks had been active, with hatches secured, they might have survivedthe first volley. Kelly\u0027s tank surged ahead and bulldozed aside the surviving tanks near them. Fred turned, accelerated to full power, and smashed through a line of retreating Grunts, a series of small, satisfying thuds reverberating through the cockpit. The two Wraith tanks shattered through a line of trees, splin.tering their trunks. Beyondlay the main Covenant camp. A thou.sand Grunts and Jackals ran toward them, weapons and personal shields ready, but none of them fired. They charged past the two tanks. \"They think we\u0027re on their side,\" Fred said. \"They\u0027re going to see what attacked them.Let\u0027s not show them otherwise until we have to.\"Kelly\u0027s acknowledgment light winked on, and she pushed a path through the onrushingGrunts—who quickly parted be.fore her. Half a kilometer ahead was a stand of hexagonal gold and silver structures: the shieldedtents of the Elites. There were half a dozen stationary plasma turrets, \"Shades,\" guardingthem, and beyond them lay the mountain under which were ONI Sec.tion Three\u0027s secretresearch caverns. The Covenant were there as well. Without thinking, Fred tapped a control; the display magni.fied. A hundred Covenant Engineers maneuvered heavy equip.ment: laser drills and conveyor belts and giant insectlike machines that looked as if they could dig through the entire mountain. \"They found the caverns,\" Fred told Kelly. \"Looks like they\u0027re going to dig them out.\"But again ... why? Why not just blast them from orbit? The Covenant had never taken prisoners—except the occasional strag.gler to execute for sport. They didn\u0027t go to thismuch trouble. Unless it wasn\u0027t Delta Team they were after. ERIC NYLUND 115Fred keyed his COM. \"Delta, if you\u0027re listening, we\u0027re com.ing in from south-southeast ina pair of captured Wraith tanks. You\u0027ll know which ones from the fireworks. Keep your heads down and don\u0027t shoot us.\"He keyed over to Kelly\u0027s personal COM. \"Blaze a trail, Red-Two! Kill everything and get tothat entrance ASAP!\"\"I\u0027m on it,\" she whispered, her voice thick with concentration. A blue acknowledgment light flickered on ... but it wasn\u0027t Kelly\u0027s. It was tagged as SPARTAN-039, Isaac. That was part of Will\u0027s team. So they were holed up at the fallback position. Relief flooded into him to know his team was here and still alive. But he couldn\u0027t hope—not yet. He had three hundred meters to cross, every millimeter ofwhich was covered with a solid wall of Covenant Grunts, Jackals, and Elites—a pathstraight through hell. Kelly rotated her tank about and fired at the remaining Wraiths and the cluster of Grunts trying to put out the fires near those she\u0027d already destroyed. For a split second theground was the surface of a sun; it flared, faded, and then was nothing but ash. Fred fired his mortar—as fast as the tank\u0027s power supply would cycle. He lobbed three silver-white projectiles at the con.centration of Elites and plasma turrets. They hadshields that protected them for a microsecond before they overloaded and collapsed.They flared like the \"strike-anywhere\" matches the ODSTs used to light their contraband cigarettes. Kelly shot arcing projectiles into the hundreds of Grunts and Jackals running in every direction. Bodies charred midstride and turned to vapor. It was as if a dozen lightning bolts had struck in the center of the camp. Grunts ran and ducked and shot at one another. The few Jack.als tried to marshal thediminutive soldiers, but the Grunts, en.raged or terrified, fired on them as well. Fred caught motion in the corner of his eye—a shadow buzzed over his tank, and a blastrocked it from side to side. That had to be Banshees. It made sense that they\u0027d already have Elites in the air, on patrol. He cursed himself for not spotting them before. It was only a matter of time now.Without infantry116HALO: FIRST STRIKEsupport, sooner or later the Covenant ground and air forces would regroup and destroy them. \"Move!\" he shouted over the COM. \"Break off contact and get to the caves!\"Kelly gunned her tank and pushed through the wreckage. Fred let her get ahead and paused to target the excavation equipment. He fired once. Three rapid impacts thudded on top of his tank—exploded and shook his teeth. He firedthree more times at the excava.tion equipment and gunned the Wraith tank. Itshuddered and lurched forward. He gritted his teeth and smiled. On the display, the smoke cleared enough for him to see that the laser drill, conveyor belts, and the insectlike diggers had been reduced to piles ofhalf-melted junk. The displays lost focus. No—Fred saw it wasn\u0027t the picture; smoke poured into the cockpit. \"Banshees circling over you,\" Kelly yelled over the COM. \"Get out!\"Fred popped the hatch and crawled out. Overhead, a dozen Banshee fliers turned to strafe his crip.pled tank. Fred jumped, rolled to his feet, and ran. A NAV marker ap.peared on his heads-up display, over a gash in the side of the mountain where the cavern entrance used to be. A red-hot sledgehammer hit him squarely in the back: a plasma pistol on overload. He reeled forward but didn\u0027t lose his balance—and kept running. There was no time to stop.He glanced at his shield bar; it was completely drained, but it slowly began to recharge.He dodged and weaved back and forth. He couldn\u0027t take many more hits like that. \"Hurry,\" Kelly said. He crossed the remaining hundred meters in seconds and jumped into a crater where there had once been a gatehouse and the secure entrance to ONI\u0027s underground base. Kelly stood, braced just over the lip of the crater, holding a Warthog\u0027s chaingun. Sheaimed over Fred\u0027s head and sprayed the enemy with thunderous suppression fire.SPARTAN-043, Will,ERIC NYLUND 117stood next to her. Fred was thrilled to see them alive—and even more thrilled to see Willholding a Jackhammer rocket launcher. \"Get below,\" Kelly said, and motioned with her head to the center of the crater. \"We\u0027llcover you.\" She continued to fire until she had depleted the chaingun\u0027s belt ofammunition. Will took aim and squeezed the trigger. A rocket knifed through the air, and a contrail ofwhite smoke connected with the cockpit of an oncoming Banshee. The alien flier disintegrated in a ball of fire. Fred turned and saw a shaft that plunged deep into the ground. A steel cable had been rigged to one side, and it angled into the depths. He grabbed the line, jumped, and zipped into the darkness. He felt a sharp vibration through the line—once, then twice—as the other Spartans followed him. After three hundred meters of free fall, he glimpsed a faint il.lumination at the bottom ofthe shaft, the feeble sickly yellow glow from chemical light sticks. Fred tightened his gripon the cable, and his descent slowed. A meter from the bottom of the shaft, he let go andlanded in a crouch. He moved out of the way. The other Spartans landed next to him. \"This way,\" Will said and moved ahead, through a set of eleva.tor doors that had beenforced open. Fred noticed that Will moved with a severe limp, and remem.bered the Spartans he hadsent here were injured. It was ironic that he had sent them out of the thick of battle, toend up in the middle of another dire situation. Then again, they weren\u0027t dead .. . which was more than he could hope for Beta Team. They stepped into a corridor with brushed stainless-steel walls that mirrored andsmeared the faint light from the chem lights. Overhead there was a tremendous explosion. Rocks and dirt showered into the shaft, anddust blossomed through the corridor. \"Lotus antitank mines,\" Will said. \"A little something to slow our uninvited guests down.\"Two other Spartans, Isaac and Vinh, sat along either side of the hallway, behind rockbarricades. They gave slight nods to Fred and kept their eyes and weapons on the end ofthe corridor. 118HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"Where\u0027s the rest of the team? And the Marines from Charlie Company?\" Fred asked. \"They didn\u0027t make it,\" Will replied, his voice flat. \"We were separated on the way here.\"He shook his head. \"No contact since then.\"Fred was quiet a moment. He listed those three as MIA on his team roster as well as theother Spartans on Will\u0027s team. The list of Spartans he could account for had grownextremely short. Fred felt his stomach twist. \"Any word from Beta Team?\"\"Negative. No contact, sir.\"Fred clenched his teeth and marked Beta Team as MIA as well. \"Gamma Team?\" Will asked. \"They\u0027re out there,\" Fred replied. \"I heard them on the COM, but I couldn\u0027t make outmuch. I warned them away from this position.\"\"Good,\" Will whispered. The hallway dead-ended in a vault door. \"The retinal and palm scanners are broken,\" Will explained. \"There\u0027s voice access, whichwe\u0027ve tried, but there\u0027s no re.sponse. This door must be a meter thick, so without cuttingtools or a hundred kilos of explosive we\u0027re stuck on this side.\"\"You spoke to the people on the other side?\" Kelly asked. \"The channel is open,\" Will said. \"But there\u0027s been no reply. Everyone on the other sideprobably bugged out.\"\"Or maybe you\u0027re just not saying anything they want to hear,\" Kelly said. She whistled asix-note singsong tune. Will nodded. \"I didn\u0027t think of that.\"The tune had been the Spartan\u0027s secret code from when they were young and training on Reach. It was their all-clear-it\u0027s-safe-to-come-out signal. No one but the Spartans and afew very select outsiders knew of it... a few outsiders who might be still here. Kelly keyed the mic and whistled the tune. She released the key and waited. Two minutes ticked off Fred\u0027s mission clock. Too much time sitting here, doing nothing,while the Covenant over their heads were undoubtedly figuring out a way to dig them outand tear them to pieces. ERIC NYLUND 119\"It was a good idea,\" he told Kelly. \"We\u0027ll recon the shaft. Maybe it\u0027s not completelycollapsed. Will you—\"A mechanism thunked and then hummed within the titanic door. There was a hiss as theseams parted, and the meter-thick door swung inward on perfectly balanced, silent hinges. Bright light flooded the passage. A silhouetted figure stood on the threshold. As Fred\u0027sdisplay compensated and enhanced the image, he saw it was human, slight of figure,female. She wore a gray pleated skirt and a white lab coat with a data pad stuffed into thebreast pocket. He caught the glimmer of her eyeglasses, black-rimmed with faint bifocallines. Her gray hair was coiled into a tight bun. But it was her face that caught and held his focus—he recog.nized the tight smooth skinthat wrinkled only in the comers of her mouth and her gray-blue eyes. She was theintellect behind the SPARTAN-II program, and the one who\u0027d invented their MJOLNIRarmor. She was Dr. Catherine Halsey.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30052.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
