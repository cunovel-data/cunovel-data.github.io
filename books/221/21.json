Ascendant Justice emerged from the non-Euclidian, non-Einsteinian realms that humans had erroneously called \"Slip-space.\" There was neither \"space\" nor anything to \"slip\" across in the alternate dimensions. The ship displaced a cloud of ice crystals that had for millen.nia been melted andrefrozen into delicate weblike geometries. Ascendant Justice\u0027s running lights diffusedthrough these parti.cles and made a glimmering halo of hard-edged reflections. Itreminded Cortana of the snowglobe that Dr. Halsey had kept on her desk: the Matterhorn and a little Swiss climber scaling its three-centimeter height—all swirling in the center ofa micro.scopic blizzard. The frozen Oort cloud around her was significantly larger, but it was still a charmingeffect and a welcome sight from the abyss ofSlipspace. Cortana had fled the Epsilon Eridani system, but only to its edge—a short jump of a few billion kilometers from Reach and the Master Chief. The odds that the Covenant would find her were long— astronomical, in fact, even if they had ships on patrol. The Oort cloud\u0027s volume was too large to search in a hundred years.Still, she powered down virtually every system on the ship except the fiision generators— and her own power systems, of course. The ship drifted in the icy dark. 192HALO: FIRST STRIKEShe redlined the reactors, however, to recharge the Slipspace capacitors and regeneratethe plasma she had expended in her brief fight with the Covenant cruisers. If she was part of a larger fleet, her desperate tactics might be valuable—flashing all her plasma away and the near-gravity Slipspace jump—but as one ship against a dozen, her effective combat lifetime using those tactics could be measured in microseconds. And now the Covenant knew that Ascendant Justice was not one of theirs. She hoped theMaster Chief would elude them— find his Spartans and somehow meet her at therendezvous coordinates—all without getting blown up by enemy ground forces and theCovenant fleet. She paused and reset her emotion subroutines—the AI equiva.lent of a deep sigh.Cortana had to remain focused and think of something useful to do while she waited. The problem was that she\u0027d been thinking at peak capacity for the last five days. And now she was thinking with a large por.tion of her mind occupied by the data absorbed from the Halo construct. She again toyed with the idea of dumping that data into Ascen.dant Justice\u0027s onboardmemory. Now that the other AI had been erased, it should be safe. Yet one piece oftechnological data had already been leaked to the enemy ... and that could have ex.treme repercussions in the war effort. If the Halo data got into Covenant hands—the war wouldbe over. She decided she would make do with her available memory-processing bandwidth. Cortana listened and looked to the center of the Epsilon Eridani system with Ascendant Justice\u0027s passive sensors. Faint Covenant communiques whispered past her—eight hours old, because that\u0027s how long it took the signal to travel from Reach to here. Interesting. The present insystem chatter was undoubtedly fo.cused on the intruders.Eight hours ago, however, it had been business as usual... whatever business that was. She eavesdropped on the data streams, translating, and tried to make sense of it all. Among the more coherent samples of their excited religiousERIC NYLUND193babble were: uncovering the fragment of divinity, and illuminat.ing shard of the gods toexist the perfect moment that vanishes in the blink of an eye but lasts forever, andcollecting the stars left by the giants. A literal translation was not a problem. It was the meaning be.hind the words thateluded her. Without the proper cultural refer.ences, this was all gibberish. It had to mean something to someone, however. Perhaps she could use part of thedissected Covenant AI to help. It had spo.ken to her, so it was partially fluent with humanidioms. She might be able to reverse-engineer its translation software. Cortana isolated the AI code and began the retrieval-and-unpacking process. This wouldtake time; she\u0027d compressed the code, and the reconstitution process would require agood deal of her reduced processing power. While she waited, she examined the Covenant reactors. They used a pinched magneticfield to heat the tritium plasma. It was sur risingly primitive. Without better hardware,though, there was little she could do to imppprove their effectiveness. Power. She needed more if she was going to head back insystem to rendezvous with theMaster Chief. The Covenant weren\u0027t go.ing to sit by and wait for them to hook up, bid afond adieu, and then escape. Logically, there was only one way to do this: She was going to have to fight and kill themall. She could conserve her ship\u0027s power and fire the plasma wea ons as they were designed.That, however, would only de.lay the inevitable. A dozen shippps against one—evenCaptain Keyes wouldn\u0027t have survived such a lopsided tactical situation. She deliberated how to solve this problem, spun off a multi.tasking routine that listedher resources, and filtered them in a creativity-probability matrix, hoping to find aninspired match. The unpacking of the alien AI\u0027s routines finished. The code appeared to her as a vast crosssection of geological strata: gray granite variables and blood red sandstone visualprocessors and oily dark function films. But there were dozens of code layers she didn\u0027teven recognize. The translation algorithms, however, were in the top layers of this structure, glisteninglike a vein of gold-laced quartz. She194HALO: FIRST STRIKEtapped into the software; it had infinite loops and dead-end code lines—things that hadto be errors. Yet there were also slender crystalline translation vectors that she would never havethought of on her own. She copied those and slaved them to her dynamic lexicon. The distant Covenant transmissions poured though her mind, now somewhat morecoherent: Inner temple layers penetrated; Infidels present, and Cleansing operationongoing; Victory is as.sured, and The Great One\u0027s purity will burn the infidels; The holyShe picked up on the urgent undertone to these transmissions, as if the notorious light cannot be tainted. Covenant confidence were not entirely genuine. Since these messages made reference to an infestation to be cleansed, and since these transmissions occurred many hours before the Ascendant Justice had entered the Epsilon Eridani system, the Master Chief had been correct in his conclusions: There were human survivors on Reach. Likely Spartans. His correct analysis of the situation based on the six-note sig.nal irritated Cortana. Itannoyed her more that she had not con.cluded this as well. It made her realize how dangerously close to the edge of her intellectual capacity she operated. One of her alert routines triggered. An access hatch on the route from the bridge to thereactor room—one that she had specifically directed Sergeant Johnson not to weld shut—just opened. \"The trap is loaded,\" she whispered. Cortana scanned the region with the ship\u0027s internal sensors. There was nothing ... unless that \"nothing\" was actually a group of camouflaged Elites—perhaps the \"Guardian of theLu.minous Key\" mentioned in the Covenant\u0027s greeting communique. She tripped the emergency hull breach shut on four bulkhead doors—two on each side ofthis opened hatch. \"Trap is sprung,\" she remarked. Cortana vented the atmosphere in this sealed section. She hoped that they had left the vent system open behind them—dooming any others leftbehind to a similar asphyxiation. Her sensors picked up a plasma grenade detonation on the in.ner port set of doors shehad sealed and locked. The discharge scrambled those circuits and disabled the locks. Shenoted thatERIC NYLUND195the doors were being slowly opened... but not enough to reach the second set of sealeddoors ahead. The opening of those doors halted. \"Gotcha,\" she whispered. She\u0027d keep that section of Ascendant Justice sealed until Sergeant Johnson could confirm the kills. She wouldn\u0027t let her guard down, either. There had to be additional alien saboteurs aboard her ship. And if she found them, she\u0027d deal with them in the same efficient fashion. This minor distraction resolved, Cortana returned her atten.tion to the Covenant AI\u0027scode. Small portions of the alien soft.ware looked like her. The odds of such a parallelevolution in computer science seemed improbable. It was almost as if it were her code ...only copied many times, each time with subtle er.rors introduced by the replication process. Could the Covenant have captured a human-made AI, copied it, and then used the resultin their ships? If so—why had there been the need to replicate the code so many times?And with so many errors? This theory didn\u0027t track, however. Smart AIs like her had an operational life span ofapproximately seven years. After that the processing memory became too interconnectedand developed fatal endless feedback loops. In essence, smart AIs became too smart and suffered an exponential attenuation of function; they literally thought themselves todeath. So if the Covenant were using human-created AIs, all the copies would be dead withinseven years—there was no reason to recopy the copies. It wouldn\u0027t extend their life span,because all the memory-processor interconnections had to be copied as well. Cortana paused to consider how much of her life span had been compromised byabsorbing and analyzing the data from Halo. Her experiences within the Forerunner computer system had certainly pushed her intellect far past its designed limits. Had sheburned away half her \"life\" doing so? More? She stored that thought for later consideration. If she didn\u0027t find a way to get the Master Chief and get back to Earth, her operational life span would be even shorter. She was, however, curious about one thing: She ran a trace on196HALO: FIRST STRIKEthe origin of the copied pathways of the alien AI, and found its replication routine. Thiscopying code was extremely convo.luted; in fact, it took up more than two thirds of theCovenant AI\u0027s processor-memory space. It was dark with functions that ran deep to thecore. It spread dendritic fingers through the sys.tem, like a cancer that had metastasizedthroughout the AI\u0027s en.tire body. She did not understand any of it. But she didn\u0027t have to understand the code to use it. Was it worth the risk of using? Perhaps. If she could mitigate the risk, she\u0027d copy aportion of herself onto an isolated system in Ascendant Justice. She could always erasethis subsystem if anything went wrong. The potential rewards of this operation were great. She might be able to restore herself tofull operational capacity—even car.rying the Halo data. Cortana double-and triple-checked the system she would overwrite: the Covenantsoftware that managed the life support on the lower decks. Since the lower decks werenow evacuated and cold, life support was moot. She carefully severed the con.nectionsfrom that subsystem to the rest of the ship. She also rechecked her thinking. This copyi software was likely responsible for theCovenant AI\u0027s fractured thinking. Her thinkingngng, however, was being squeezed to nothing.There had to be a balance between these two deleterious states. Cortana initialized the Covenant file-duplication software. It moved, and the entire thingpulsed and reached for her; she im.mediately shut down all contact with her translationsuite. The dark functions touched her code, wrapped around them, pushed against the barriersshe had erected. It happened too fast, but she didn\u0027t stop the process. It was far too interesting to stop. She distantly felt that portion of her mind blur and replicate, assembled line by line intoits new location within Ascendant Justice. It felt strange. Not that it was strange she couldthink in more than one place about more than one thing at the same time—she was usedto multiprocessing. This was different strange—as if she had a glimpse into some.thing wonderful... andinfinite. ERIC NYLUND197The replication ceased, and the copying code was once again in.ert and safely stored withthe dissected Covenant AI\u0027s directory. Cortana ran her entire system; nothing else had been altered. She checked the new copied system. It was intact, and, apart from a few slight errors inthe software—which she immediately mended—it appeared functional. She initiated the new system and slaved it with her original system, runni them inparallel—one tapping the ONI\u0027s English-Covenant lexicon, the other tappingngng the alien AI\u0027sCovenant-English lexicon. If the alien copying software could duplicate her translation routine, could it duplicatemore of her? No. She squelched that thought. The risk of copying any more \"hers\" was too great. Therewere too many unknowns. And this was, after all, the enemy\u0027s code. There could be boobytraps, waiting to be tripped within the complex algorithms. Besides, copying herself would do nothing to prevent her mental degradation. Thoseinterconnection errors were already present ... and they always would be, despite thenumber of copies generated. She remembered the strange fractured speech patterns of the Covenant AI and wonderedhow many times it had been copied. Her thoughts were interrupted as the Covenant transmissions became clear. It wassuddenly as if she had a new set of eyes and ears to hear them: Excavation proceeding;new sublayer discovered at six-hundred-meter depth, and Patrol unable to find theInfidels; returning to base, and Minor artifacts discovered; rejoice! And there was one thing she had missed in her previous analy.sis of the Covenantcommuniques, a second signal on the carrier wave: They used the same symbols she hadused to find the Halo construct—the symbols that the Master Chief had discovered on thealien artifact on Cote d\u0027Azur. She hadn\u0027t seen the simple dots, bars, squares, and triangles before because the Covenant,naturally, had embellished the clean symbols with their highly decorated calligraphiedscripts, and further with their overwrought religious allusions. Cortana, with her new subsystem and her new translation lexi.con, could, as Dr. Halseymight say, \"cut through the crap.\"198HALO: FIRST STRIKEThese subcommuniques were orders. They originated from new ships entering theEpsilon Eridani system and were, in turn, accepted and acknowledged by those outbound. It was an automated mail system that could carry messages from the center of theCovenant Empire to the outer reaches of the galaxy. The Covenant were either tooarrogant, or too igno.rant, to properly encrypt these orders. Still, Cortana realized that the UNSC had not, until just now, discovered their deceptivelysimple system... so who was more ignorant? There were deplo ment orders for hundreds of ships: carriers, destroyers, tenders—amassive fleet. Theyyy were to meet at select locations, join up, refuel, gather resources, andthen orient for the next Slipspace jump. Cortana knew how to translate these simple symbols into stel.lar coordinates. There—a jump to the Lambda Serpentis system to gather tri.tium gas for their reactors.And there—another jump to the Hawking system to meet with three dozen carriers andeffect a transfer of Seraph fighters. And there—Cortana halted all her processes. She directed her full intellect to check and recheck hertranslation matrix a hundred times. There was no error. The terminating coordinates for the Covenant\u0027s impending operation was Sol. The Covenant were headed to Earth.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30061.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
