{"id":6839,"no":14,"title":"chapter 14","content":"0901 hours, August 30,2552 (Military Calendar)\\Epsilon Eridani system, ONIunderground facility, planet Reach. \\n\\n \\n\\n The secure storage doors whispered open, and overhead fluo.rescent lights strobed on.Fred saw motion—but it was only his own reflection in the burnished-mirror finish of thechamber\u0027s stainless-steel walls. Will stepped inside and looked up, then glanced backdown the corridor. \\n\\n \\n\\n The room was a three-by-five-meter vault with steel walls, floor, and ceiling. Theirfootfalls were muffled as they entered, so the floor had to be at least a quarter meter thick. Along the right and left walls stood secure floor -to-ceiling lockers, and two metalcrates sat along the far wall. Every surface was spotless, and every seam had been precision-milled to prevent explosives or acids from penetrating. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One moment, please,\" Kalmiya told them. \"I\u0027m attempting to access the locks now. Please stand by.\"Will stood at the doorway and watched their backs. It didn\u0027t make Fred feel any more atease. The abandoned ONI base was somehow more intimidating than facing the Covenant invasion force overhead. He had walked down these corridors a dozen times during histraining on Reach. This base had always been full of people; now, empty, it drove thepoint home that the Cove.nant were winning. First the Outer Colonies had been crushed;now Reach. How long before humanity was forced to retreat all the way back to Earth?And after that... what? There would be no other choice but victory or extinction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Enough. Such musings didn\u0027t help him achieve his immediateERIC NYLUND 133objective. He\u0027d leave the long-range strategies to Generals and Admirals. It was time toconcentrate on what he did best. \\n\\n \\n\\n The walls hummed as thick metal bolts inside the lockers re.tracted, the sound of heavy oiled steel sliding over steel. With a final thump, the sound ceased. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kalmiya said, \"Lockers open and safeties disabled, Spartans. Help yourselves.\"\"Secure the outer door, please,\" Fred told her. \\n\\n \\n\\n The door to the hallway eased shut and locked, and Will moved to Fred\u0027s side. EachSpartan opened one of the wall lock.ers, standing to the side in case there was some leftover booby trap within that Kalmiya had failed to disable. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred peered inside and saw a rack of handguns. They weren\u0027t the standard-issue HEpistols; these had oversized barrels— easily 30 percent larger and longer—and they hadgrips of self-molding plastasteel. He picked one up and hefted it—its balance was barrelheavy, to be expected from an unloaded pistol. He found three boxes of clips at thebottom of the locker, opened one, and took out a clip. Whatever this new handgun shot, itwas high caliber, slugs the size of his thumb. He slid the clip into the gun, and it securedwith a satisfying click. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now it was perfectly balanced, far better than the standard-issue sidearm. \\n\\n \\n\\n He secured the weapon and turned to see what Will had found. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will examined a plastic-wrapped rifle. He removed the rifle from the locker, ripped off itssheathing, and shouldered it. He nodded with satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Unlike the MA5B, this rifle had a longer barrel and stock, with a cutdown muzzle shroud.A scope was mounted on an op.tics railing along the top of the rifle. Will hefted a clip and in.serted it into the receiver. \\n\\n \\n\\n He shouldered the rifle again and peered through the scope. \"Auto zoom, nice.\"Will and Fred then traded and inspected the new weapons. Fred liked the feel of this new rifle, but wondered how much punch it had—enough, he hoped, to make the trade-off ofhaving fewer rounds in the clip worth it. \\n\\n \\n\\n They filled two sacks with the new pistols, rifles, and ammu.nition, then moved to thefootlockers and lifted the lids. \\n\\n \\n\\n 134HALO: FIRST STRIKEInside the first locker were satchel charges. Fred grabbed three and looped them over hisneck. \"I think we can find a use for these.\"Will knelt next to the second footlocker. Within were plastic boxes marked MJOLNIRMARK V followed by a long list of serial numbers. \"This must be what Doctor Halsey wanted,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a flutter in the floor—which got Fred\u0027s full atten.tion, because a \"flutter\" in a solid steel floor meant trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n The COM channel opened, and Dr. Halsey\u0027s voice crackled with static: \"Get back to the labASAP. I might have a way out. Quickly!\"The vault room flexed, and thunder rumbled through the walls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Detonations,\" Will said. \"They\u0027re coming.\"\"Secure those boxes,\" Fred ordered. He raced to the closed doors. \"Open,\" he shouted toKalmiya and waited as the door slowly eased apart. He scanned up and down the corridor and then ran back toward the lab. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they got to the medical wing the lights were dead, and Fred saw Kelly\u0027s helmetlights cut through the velvet-rich, dust-filled darkness. She had Dr. Halsey draped overher shoulder. Blood ran from the doctor\u0027s nostrils. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her office collapsed,\" Kelly told them. \"Support beam missed her by a centimeter.\"Dr. Halsey looked up and whispered, \"I\u0027m fine. Really.\" She pushed away from Kelly,stood, and teetered in place. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred scooped her up and set her on the examination table. \"With all due respect, ma\u0027am,you\u0027re not.\"Another detonation rippled through the earth—this one stronger than the previousexplosion. Fissures snaked through the con.crete walls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vinh and Isaac bounded into the room. \"Enemy contacts at extreme range,\" Vinhreported. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down,\" Dr. Halsey said, and she held a palm-sized data pad for Fred to see. It had a mapon its display ... but not of this base. \"We have to go lower.\"Fred wondered if Dr. Halsey was delirious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down the elevator shaft in Section Sigma,\" she explained. \"We\u0027ll seal it behind us. Wecan\u0027t let them follow.\"\"Kelly, take point,\" Fred ordered. He grabbed two of the newERIC NYLUND135magnum pistols, loaded them, and then tossed them to Kelly, along with three extra clips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess you get to test these.\"Kelly gazed at the new weapons and gave a low whistle. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred opened the bags with die new rifles and handed them out to his team. \"Will, youmule the extra parts and ammo.\"\"Roger,\" Will replied and slung them over his shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Those satchels, over there,\" Dr. Halsey said and waved to four duffel bags. \"Medicalsupplies. Food and water. We\u0027ll need them, too.\"Will grabbed them as well. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just a few more things,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"We can\u0027t let them get into ONI\u0027s records.\" She tapped her pad once and then said to Kalmiya, \"Begin Operation White Glove.Irradiate all computer memory crystal. Code file access Beta-Foxtrot-99874.\" Dr. Halseyclosed her eyes as if she were concentrating, and she whispered, \"Not all AIs have the fail-safe option, my dear Kalmiya... just the ones that matter.\"\"I understand, Doctor.\" There was a pause, and the AI spoke again, her voice sad. \"Voiceand fi erprint accepted and veri.fied. Fail-safe code verified. It has been ... a pleasureworkingngng with you, Doctor Halsey.\"\"The pleasure has been mine, Kalmiya.\" She stood straighter and said, \"Fail-safe overrideaccess: \u0027Ragnarok.\u0027 Give us a three-minute countdown.\"A three-minute counter appeared in the corner of Fred\u0027s heads-up display. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Halsey turned to him. \"I\u0027ve activated the explosives cache under this base, which willlevel the complex. We have to get be.low, to the original titanium mine tunnels.\"Fred wished she had consulted with him before she had given them only three minutes.Then again, Dr. Halsey knew what was at stake, what secrets were hidden in this base,and what damage could occur if the Covenant got their hands on those secrets. \\n\\n \\n\\n Five minutes might be too much time considering what was at risk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Understood,\" Fred replied. \"Isaac, you\u0027re rear guard. Vinh, stick close to Kelly. I\u0027ll takeDoctor Halsey.\" Fred picked up the doctor with great care. She couldn\u0027t have weighedmore than fifty kilos—light as a stick. \\n\\n \\n\\n 136HALO: FIRST STRIKE\"I\u0027ve lost targets on motion sensors,\" Vinh whispered over the COM. \"They were close,too.\"\"Kelly, watch for camouflaged Elites.\"\"Affirmative,\" she said. She scanned the room, moved to a cabinet, and grabbed a tin canmarked TALC. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s move,\" Fred ordered. \"Kalmiya, kill the lights in the base. Hand signals only—I wantradio silence.\"Four blue acknowledgment lights winked on.lights winked on. \\n\\n \\n\\n The faint light filtering in from the outer hall died. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly slid into the hallway and melted into the shadows. Vinh followed, then Fred andIsaac. Will trailed behind, moving slower because of the care he took to remain quiet withthe gear. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dr. Halsey tapped her data pad, and a map uploaded onto Fred\u0027s heads-up display, a pathtraced through corridors and a NAV marker designated an elevator shaft. That was theirobjective. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Spartans winked on their acknowledgment lights, con.firming the route. \\n\\n \\n\\n They crept forward, smooth and silent—oil sliding over oil— until Kelly halted ten meters before a five-way intersection. The Spartans froze and waited. She crouched, setthe can of talc on the floor, and then stood with her knees bent. \\n\\n \\n\\n She waited another heartbeat, then gave a slight shake of her head from side to side— their signal for trouble ahead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vinh moved next to Fred\u0027s flank, and Fred set Dr. Halsey down and stood in front of her.Will crouched next to the doctor to provide cover with his own body if needed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Isaac remained on their six. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly kicked the can. It tumbled end over end through the air, and as it entered theintersection Kelly squeezed off a single shot. The flash of light from the muzzleilluminated the passage just long enough for them to see the can explode and a cloud ofwhite dust mushroom into the hallways. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their motion detectors flickered, and four targets resolved on their displays. Image enhancement showed the wavering out.lines of four Covenant Elites—their light-bending camouflage fluttering and overloading as the talc powder coated them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly open fire with both pistols. The Elite closest dropped as three slugs poundedthrough its shields, and a round caught it inERIC NYLUND 137the center of its elongated forehead. Purple blood blossomed across the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n The remaining Elites returned fire, and Kelly bounded for.ward, plasma flaring at theedge of her shield. She ducked into the side passage. \\n\\n \\n\\n The instant Kelly was out of the line of fire, Fred shouldered his rifle and squeezed thetrigger. A three-round burst caught the next Elite, and its shield sparkled and failed. Ittwisted away, clutching at the single round that had penetrated its chesthe single round that had penetrated its chest. \\n\\n \\n\\n Vinh fired two single shots, but the Elite\u0027s shield held. In uni.son, Vinh and Fred firedanother set of three-round bursts. The Elite dropped to the steel floor in a twisted heap. \\n\\n \\n\\n The last Elite had vanished. No return fire. No sensor contact. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Spartans held position for a moment longer, then re.grouped. With hand signals,each member of the team reported no contact. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred spied tracks in the white dust scattered on the floor. The Elite had bugged out, and itwas most likely gathering reinforcements. \\n\\n \\n\\n That wasn\u0027t what Covenant Elites usually did. Their pride de.manded that they fight, anddie fighting, if need be. They would hurl themselves headlong into battle, no matter theodds, and die by the hundreds if necessary. They never ran away. Nothing about thisengagement had been \"usual.\"Fred glanced at Will and Dr. Halsey. Will gave him a thumbs-up, indicating that the doctorhadn\u0027t been wounded in the exchange. \\n\\n \\n\\n After the exchange of gunfire, there was no need for secrecy. \"One of them got away,\"Fred told them. \"We need to move, too... and forget quiet.\"The Spartans ran down the corridor. They heard and felt an.other explosion directly overtheir heads. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly skidded to a halt in front of the locked elevator doors. She gripped one of the panels;Fred and Vinh gripped the seam of the other side, and the Spartans pried them apart as ifthe five-centimeter steel alloy were no tougher than the rind of an orange. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly grabbed the elevator cables and slid down. Vinh fol.lowed, then Fred plummetedmore than five hundred meters into138HALO: FIRST STRIKEthe darkness. The three of them ripped open the doors at the bot.tom of the shaft. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will slid down next with Dr. Halsey holding on to his neck. Isaac followed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There should be an air vent,\" Dr. Halsey whispered. \"There.\"Kelly ripped off the vent cover and peered down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It leads to the old mine tunnels,\" Dr. Halsey told them, \"and more, I hope.\"\"Go,\" Fred ordered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kelly dived in, headfirst. They waited ten seconds, and her ac.knowledgment lightwinked on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fred entered next, sliding through the vent duct. It twisted and turned and finallydumped him into a long tunnel of roughly hewn granite. The ceiling was ten meters highand—judging from the three-meter-wide tire tracks in the dust—big enough for heavy equipment to have rolled through. \\n\\n \\n\\n Will slid out of the duct with Dr. Halsey riding on his chest. Vinh and Isaac came after them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s more to this place,\" Dr. Halsey told them, standing up and brushing the dustfrom her lab coat. \"This is only the be.ginning. We have to—\"A thunderous detonation cut her off. The mountain exploded, and ONI\u0027s base collapsedover their heads. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997/30054.html","bookId":221,"book":{"id":221,"title":"Halo Series 光晕：初次反击 3.FIRST TRIKE","description":"简介： 　　摧毁光晕后，从光晕上成功出逃的约翰尽力收拢被打散的人类残余部队，力图回到地球。而致远星也并未被圣约人彻底摧毁，约翰的部下大多还活着因为致远星上有着圣约人渴望得到的光晕建造者所留下的圣物。约翰超人一般永不停息地战斗着，居然成功抢夺了一艘敌舰杀回致远...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/997","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM"}}
