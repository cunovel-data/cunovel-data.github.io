There’s even a song about him,” she said, and sang a few bars of the old marching tune.\n My name is Captain Will, oh Will,\n I turned pirate when I killed good men,\n Their worthy blood did spill.\n Their worthy blood did spill, did spill,\n Their worthy blood did spill.\n He laughed, and she felt they were both intoxicated by their discovery. “I said you looked like an owl with your spectacles, but I didn’t know you sang like one too.”\n She gave him a swat. “I don’t know that that’s a compliment.”\n “Always, luvvie.” He swatted her right back, on her bottom. He shook his head, retreating into his thoughts. “And that’s my man with the black pearl.”\n “How odd,” she said, her musing tone a match to his. “A man wearing jewelry.”\n “Not really. Sailors are a superstitious lot, fearing shipwreck above all things. They think the only way to ensure a Christian burial is to wear the cost of their coffin on their person. Gold, silver, gems … all worn in earrings, mostly. I’m sure this man—and much of his crew—is no different. His was a black pearl, though, and I’ve not seen its like since.”\n She took the paper from his hand. “This is it,” she said somberly. “This will be our proof. We’re so close now. We only need evidence of the captain’s piracy, and my father will be sure to cancel the engagement.”\n They crested the final hill on the path to her house. She slowed her pace, until her feet gradually came to a stop. Reaching home meant bidding farewell to Aidan.\n She stared down into the glen, looking blindly at the stone fence he’d built for them. She’d never again be able to look at that square of pastureland without thinking of him.\n “My fence work is done,” he said, as though reading her mind.\n Their tutoring work was at an end, as was his work on their farm. Would he be done with her too? Aidan’s enemy was within his reach. Would he find and kill the man, only to disappear from her life forever?\n Unable to look him in the eye, she stared instead at her flock of dull-eyed beasts, feeding in the distance. “Does that mean I’ll no longer see you?”\n “I think I might come back,” he said casually.\n She couldn’t bring herself to look at him, and he laughed, and her cheeks broiled with embarrassment.\n “Silly woman, look at me.” He cupped the side of her face, and when she met his eyes, he told her, “Here’s a secret, luvvie. I despise milk.”\n She thought of all the cups she’d brought him, and all the times he’d come to visit, asking for more. She saw her amazed realization reflected in his smile.\n “That’s right,” he said. “Why else do you think I’ve been coming around? It’s because I want to see you. Why else find a way to break from Fraser, but to be with you.”\n It was her turn to give a rueful laugh, and he placed a quick kiss on her smiling lips.\n He pulled away, glancing around. “Your father is surely about somewhere. Now, are we of a mind, or do you need me to promise to build you another fence? I don’t know that my back can take it.”\n “No,” she answered sheepishly. “We’re of a mind.”\n “Good. Because we’ve yet to figure why he”—he shook his piece of paper—“is in league with Fraser. I can’t simply storm the Endeavor and kill this Captain Will. If we discover the nature of their business together, perhaps we’ll find your evidence and my opportunity, in one fell swoop.”\n She didn’t need to think. Only one obvious path unfolded ahead of her.\n Heroines stood by their men, and she’d stand by hers. “With this betrothal, I have an entrée into Fraser’s inner circle. I can discover the nature of their business, find out when and how you can gain access to the man with the black pearl. Unquestionably, I must proceed with my father’s plan.”\n Aidan looked taken aback. “Unquestionably, you’ll do nothing of the sort. God’s bones, Beth, the sooner we put a stop to that nonsense the better.”\n “No, don’t you see?” It was all so clear, coming to her in a flash. “For now, I must proceed with the engagement. Would you like to hear my plan?”\n He took a step backward, as if staggering from a blow. “You can’t actually tell me you’ll encourage his pursuit of your hand?”\n “It’s the only way to find out more.”\n Aidan’s expression was stark. “How can you agree to marry him?”\n “I won’t actually be marrying him.”\n “Then don’t actually accept this engagement.”\n “We need clues as to how to infiltrate Captain Will’s network,” she said. “This is the best way.”\n “I admire your courage,” he said, his voice tight. “You have an unusual habit of not showing fear. But this is too much.”\n “I have nothing to fear with you by my side.”\n “I won’t be by your side if Fraser takes you to the marriage bed.” He shot her a bitter look, and it was like looking into the face of pain.\n “Good heavens, but it won’t come to that.” It was just like a man not to listen to her plan, focusing instead on a rival for her virtue. “This is merely a ruse,” she explained slowly. “One that will end when we discover hard evidence.”\n She began to walk down the hill toward her cottage. She had a plan to enact, whether Aidan liked it or not.\n “This isn’t one of your books,” he said, catching up to her. “Not every tale has a happy ending. If you agree to this, who’s to say you’ll find proof of anything beyond what’s apparent to the eye—what if Fraser really is just an old merchant, inadvertently caught up in something over his head, and in possession of a fat bank account he’ll use to pay your father’s debts? What then? Or, who’s to say the man won’t simply ignore the engagement, and come and steal you away instead?”\n She stopped on the hillside. “This may not be one of my books, but neither is it a page from your story. Not everyone is stolen away,” she said gently. “I shall be perfectly safe. Steal me away? Really, Aidan. My father would never allow such a thing.”\n “I would never allow it,” he grumbled. “I won’t allow any of it.”\n Determined, she took a different tack. “This is all idle speculation. My father has set my course. Until we find evidence of any wrongdoing, there is no way he’ll break the betrothal.”\n “Don’t I have a say?”\n She bristled. He had a say, and more than a say—his thoughts and actions affected her more than he could ever know. But she saw the way of it clearly, and he didn’t seem to understand.\n She could act as bravely as he, and with as much success. She could solve both their problems at once, if only he’d trust her.\n She stuck with the argument that, sadly, was closest to the truth. “My father has made his decision. I’m afraid you don’t have a choice. I have no choice.”\n “There’s always a choice.”\n “You, of all men, know that’s not true.” She sighed, tired of arguing. She knew her plan was their only option. If he disagreed, she’d have to proceed on her own—he’d see the wisdom of her actions later. “I know my father. Whatever your feelings for me, you have no claim. There can be no claim.”\n She turned and was continuing down the hill when she felt him grab her. He spun her, the look on his face dangerous. He held her shoulders in his hands, and she couldn’t look away.\n “If you think I’ll stand idly by while you put yourself in harm’s way. Beth …” Fury made his words come haltingly. “Dammit, Beth, if you think I can watch as you give yourself … to another man—”\n “Is everything all right here?”\n She recognized Angus’s slow baritone. Aidan’s grip eased, and though he reluctantly let her go, anger sparked in his eyes.\n “Aye,” she said, looking up to face the farmer. “I have the situation well in hand.”\n Aidan gave a bitter laugh. “So you think.”\n Angus loomed on the hilltop, and though he only held a spade, the burly man somehow managed to make the thing look like the most intimidating of weapons. He pinned Aidan with an unwavering glare. “Is the MacAlpin bothering you? Never before have I heard you shout so.”\n “He is bothering me.” She met and held Aidan’s eye. “Or rather, his closed mind is.”\n “I’m not bothering her,” Aidan said angrily. “I’m talking sense into her.”\n She raised her brows. “And you’re just about done?”\n Aidan reached out to touch her, but after a glance up at the farmer stayed his hand. “This is far from done.” He met her eyes, and the expression on his face chilled her. “You’re diving into deep waters. Deeper than you know. You must listen to me, listen to sense. Let me keep you safe.”\n He was being overprotective, but she knew, only she had the power to find the information they needed. “Sense? I’m the most sensible woman I know. You’ll see. I’m stronger and cleverer than you take me for. I don’t need you or any man to keep me safe, when I am perfectly capable of handling matters on my own.”\n She hated hurting him, hated arguing, but he’d forgive her the moment he saw her plan triumph. Keeping her face brave, she told him, “Go, Aidan. This is my business now.”\n Elspeth stormed to the bottom of the hill, knowing he hadn’t followed. It seemed, where Aidan was concerned, she’d only just found her voice and her confidence, and it broke her heart to have to use both just to squabble. But she would have her way, because she knew, it was in her power to help both of them.\n She would prove Dougal an unfit mate. And she’d lead Aidan to his enemy in the bargain. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-own-clan-macalpin-2/page-36.html","bookId":2657,"book":{"id":2657,"title":"Devil\u0027s Own (Clan MacAlpin #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Own (Clan MacAlpin #2) \n After surviving slavery, Aiden MacAlpin has nothing but thoughts of vengeance.
