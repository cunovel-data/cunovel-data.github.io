{"id":97078,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Pankow sensibly cuffed him and managed to determine where he lived. He led the suspect up two flights of stairs and into the apartment Vanderpoel and Wendy Hanniford had occupied, where he found Wendy Hanniford \"apparently deceased, unclothed, and disfigured by slashes apparently inflicted by a sharp weapon.\" Pankow then phoned in, and the usual machinery went into action. The medical examiner\u0027s man had come around to confirm what Pankow had figured out-that Wendy was, in fact, dead. The photo crew took their pictures, several of the blood-spattered apartment, a great many of Wendy\u0027s corpse. There was no telling what she might have looked like alive. She had died from loss of blood, and Lady Macbeth was right about that; no one would guess how much blood a body can lose in the process of dying. You can put an ice pick in a man\u0027s heart and barely a drop of blood will show on his shirtfront, but Vanderpoel had cut her breasts and thighs and belly and throat, and the whole bed was an ocean of blood. After they\u0027d photographed the body, they removed it for autopsy. A Dr. Jainchill of the medical examiner\u0027s office had done the full postmortem. He stated that the victim was a Caucasian female in her twenties, that she had had recent sexual intercourse, both oral and genital, that she had been slashed twenty-three times with a sharp instrument, most probably a razor, that there were no stab wounds (which might have been why he was opting for the razor), that various veins and arteries, which he conscientiously named, had been wholly or partially severed in the course of this mistreatment, that death had occurred at approximately four o\u0027clock that afternoon, give or take twenty minutes, and that there was in his opinion no possibility whatsoever that the wounds had been self-inflicted. I was proud of him for taking such a firm stand on the last point. The rest of the folder consisted of bits of information which would ultimately be supplemented by copies of formal reports filed by other branches of the machine. There was a note to the effect that the prisoner had been brought before a magistrate and formally charged with homicide the day after his arrest. Another memo gave the name of the court-appointed attorney. Another noted that Richard Vanderpoel had been found dead in his cell shortly before six Saturday morning. The folder would grow fatter in time to come. The case was closed, but the Sixth\u0027s file would go on growing like a corpse\u0027s hair and fingernails. The guard who looked in and saw Richard Vanderpoel hanging from the steam pipe would write up his findings. So would the physician who pronounced him dead and the physician who established beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was the strips of bedclothing tied together and knotted around his neck that had done him in. Ultimately a coroner\u0027s inquest would conclude that Wendy Hanniford had been murdered by Richard Vanderpoel and that Richard Vanderpoel had in turn taken his own life. The Sixth Precinct, and everyone else connected with the case, had already reached this conclusion. They had reached the first part of it well before Vanderpoel had been booked. The case was closed. I went back and read through some of the material again. I studied the photos in turn. The apartment itself didn\u0027t look to be greatly disturbed, which suggested the killer had been someone known to her. I went back to the autopsy. No skin under Wendy\u0027s fingernails, no obvious signs of a struggle. Facial contusions? Yes, so she could have been unconscious while he cut her up. She had probably been awhile dying. If he\u0027d cut the throat first, and got the jugular right, she would have gone fast. But she had lost a lot of blood from the wounds on the torso. I picked out one print and tucked it inside my shirt. I wasn\u0027t sure why I wanted it but knew it would never be missed. I knew a desk cop in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn who used to take home a copy of every grisly picture he could get his hands on. I never asked why. I had everything back in order and returned to the file folder by the time Koehler came back. He had a fresh cigar going. I got out from behind his desk. He asked me if I was satisfied. \"I\u0027d still like to talk to Pankow.\" \"I already set it up. I figured you\u0027re too fucking stubborn to change your mind. You find a single damn thing in that mess?\" \"How do I know? I don\u0027t even know what I\u0027m looking for. I understand she was hooking. Any evidence of that?\" \"Nothing hard. There would be if we looked. Good wardrobe, couple hundred in her handbag, no visible means of support. What\u0027s that add up to?\" \"Why was she living with Vanderpoel?\" \"He had a twelve-inch tongue.\" \"Seriously. Was he pimping for her?\" \"Probably.\" \"You didn\u0027t have a sheet on either of them, though.\" \"No. No arrest. They didn\u0027t exist officially for us until he decided to cut her up.\" I closed my eyes for a minute. Koehler said my name. I looked up. I said, \"Just a thought. Something you said before about time putting Hanniford on the spot. It\u0027s true in a way besides the one you mentioned. If she was killed by person or persons unknown, you\u0027d have put the past two years of her life on slides and run them through a microscope. But it was over before it started, and it\u0027s not your job to do that now.\" \"Right. So it\u0027s your job instead.\" \"Uh-huh. What did he kill her with?\" \"Doc says a razor.\" He shrugged. \"Good a guess as any.\" \"What happened to the murder weapon?\" \"Yeah, I figured you wouldn\u0027t miss that. We didn\u0027t turn it up. You can\u0027t make much out of that. There was a window open, he could have pitched it out.\" \"What\u0027s outside of the window?\" \"Airshaft.\" \"You checked it?\" \"Uh-huh. Anybody coulda picked it up, any kid passing through.\" \"Check for blood spots in the airshaft?\" \"Are you kidding? An airshaft in the Village? People piss out windows, they throw Tampax out, garbage, everything. Nine out of ten airshafts you\u0027ll find blood spots. Would you have checked? With the killer already wrapped up?\" \"No.\" \"Anyway, forget the airshaft. He bolts out of the apartment with the knife in his hand. Or the razor, whatever the fuck it was. He drops it on the staircase. He runs out in the street and drops it on the sidewalk. He puts it in an open garbage can. He drops it down a sewer. Matt, we don\u0027t have an eyewitness who saw him come out of the building. We woulda turned one up if we needed one, but the son of a bitch was dead thirty-six hours after he cooled the girl.\" It kept coming back to that. I was doing a job the police would have done if they had had to do it. But Richard Vanderpoel had saved them the trouble. \"So we don\u0027t know when he hit the street,\" Koehler was saying. \"Two minutes before Pankow got to him? Ten minutes? He coulda chewed up the knife and ate it in that amount of time. Christ knows he was crazy enough.\" \"Was there a razor in the apartment?\" \"You mean a straight razor? No.\" \"I mean a man\u0027s razor.\" \"Yeah, he had an electric. Why the hell don\u0027t you forget about the razor? You know what those fucking autopsies are like. I had one a couple years ago, the asshole in the medical examiner\u0027s office said the victim had been killed with a hatchet. We already caught the bastard on the premises with a croquet mallet in his hand. Anybody who could mistake the damage done by splitting someone\u0027s skull with a hatchet and beating it in with a mallet couldn\u0027t tell a razor slash from a cunt.\" I nodded. I said, \"I wonder why he did it.\" \"Because he was out of his fucking mind, that\u0027s why he did it. He ran up and down the street covered with her blood, screaming his head off and waving his cock at the world. Ask him why he did it and he wouldn\u0027t know himself.\" \"What a world.\" \"Jesus, don\u0027t let me get started on that. This neighborhood gets worse and worse. Don\u0027t get me started.\" He gave me a nod, and we walked together out of his office and out through the squad room. Men in plainclothes and men in uniforms sat at typewriters, laboriously pounding out stories about presumed miscreants and alleged perpetrators. A woman was making a report in Spanish to a uniformed officer, pausing intermittently to weep. I wondered what she had done or what had been done to her. I didn\u0027t see anybody in the squad room that I recognized. Koehler said, \"You hear about Barney Segal? They made it permanent. He\u0027s head of the Seventeenth.\" \"Well, he\u0027s a good man.\" \"One of the best. How long you been off the force, Matt?\" \"Couple of years, I guess.\" \"Yeah. How\u0027re Anita and the boys? Doing okay?\" \"They\u0027re fine.\" \"You keep in touch, then.\" \"From time to time.\" As we neared the front desk he stopped, cleared his throat. \"You ever think about putting the badge back on, Matt?\" \"No way, Eddie.\" \"That\u0027s a goddam shame, you know that?\" \"You do what you have to do.\" \"Yeah.\" He drew himself up and got back to business. \"I set it with Pankow so he\u0027ll be looking for you around nine tonight. He\u0027ll be at a bar called Johnny Joyce\u0027s. It\u0027s on Second Avenue, I forget the cross street.\" \"I know the place.\" \"They know him there, so just ask the bartender to point him out to you. He\u0027s on his own time tonight, so I told him you\u0027d make it worth his while.\" And told him to make sure a piece of it came back to the lieutenant, no doubt. \"Matt?\" I turned. \"What the hell are you gonna ask him, anyway?\" \"I want to know what obscene language Vanderpoel was using.\" \"Seriously?\" I nodded. \"I think you\u0027re as crazy as Vanderpoel,\" he told me. \"For the price of a hat you can hear all the dirty words in the world.\" Chapter 3 Bethune Street runs west from Hudson toward the river. It is narrow and residential. Some trees had been recently planted. Their bases were guarded by little picket fences hung with signs imploring dog owners to thwart their pets\u0027 natural instincts. WE LOVE OUR TREE/PLEASE CURB YOUR DOG. Number 194 was a renovated brownstone with a front door the color of Astroturf. There were five apartments, one to a floor. A sixth bell in the vestibule was marked SUPERINTENDENT. I rang it and waited. The woman who opened the door was around thirty-five. She wore a man\u0027s white shirt with the top two buttons open and a pair of stained and faded jeans. She was built like a fireplug. Her hair was short and seemed to have been hacked at randomly with a pair of dull shears. The effect was not displeasing, though. She stood in the doorway and looked up at me and decided within five seconds that I was a cop. I gave her my name and learned that hers was Elizabeth Antonelli. I told her I wanted to talk to her. \"What about?\" \"Your third-floor tenants.\" \"Shit. I thought that was over and done with. I\u0027m still waiting for you guys to unlock the door and clear their stuff out. The landlord wants me to show the apartment, and I can\u0027t even get into it.\" \"It\u0027s still padlocked?\" \"Don\u0027t you guys talk to each other?\" \"I\u0027m not on the force. This is private.\" Her eyes did a number. She liked me better now that I wasn\u0027t a cop, but now she had to know what angle I was working. Also if I wasn\u0027t on official business, that meant she didn\u0027t have to feel compelled to waste her time on me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-3.html","bookId":2319,"book":{"id":2319,"title":"The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1)","description":"Storyline: The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1) The hooker was young, pretty...and dead, butchered in a Greenwich village apartment.
