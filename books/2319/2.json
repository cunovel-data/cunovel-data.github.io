{"id":97077,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"But you still didn\u0027t know where she was, or how she was living.\"\n \"No.\" He lowered his eyes. \"That\u0027s part of it, of course. Why I\u0027m busy now, locking up the empty stable.\" His eyes returned to mine, and there was something in them that I wanted to turn from, and couldn\u0027t. \"I have to know how much to blame myself.\"\n Did he really think he would ever have the answer to that one? Oh, he might find himself an answer, but it would not be the right answer. There is never a right answer to that inescapable question.\n He finished writing the check and passed it to me. He had left space blank where my name belonged. He told me he thought I might like it made out to Cash. I said payable to me was fine, and he uncapped his pen again and wrote Matthew Scudder on the right line. I folded it and put it in my wallet.\n I said, \"Mr. Hanniford, there\u0027s something you left out. You don\u0027t think it\u0027s important, but it might be, and you think it might be.\"\n \"How do you know that?\"\n \"Instinct, I suppose. I spent a lot of years watching people decide how close they cared to come to the truth. There\u0027s nothing you have to tell me, but-\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s extraneous, Scudder. I left it out because I didn\u0027t think it fit in, but-Oh, the hell with it. Wendy\u0027s not my biological daughter.\"\n \"She was adopted?\"\n \"I adopted her. My wife is Wendy\u0027s mother. Wendy\u0027s father was killed before Wendy was born, he was a Marine, he died in the landing at Inchon.\" He looked away again. \"I married Wendy\u0027s mother three years after that. From the beginning I loved her as much as any real father could have. When I found out that I wasâ€¦ unable to father children myself, I was even more grateful for her existence. Well? Is it important?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Probably not.\" But of course it was important to me. It told me something more about Hanniford\u0027s load of guilt.\n \"Scudder? You\u0027re not married, are you?\"\n \"Divorced.\"\n \"Any children?\"\n I nodded. He started to say something, and didn\u0027t. I began wanting him to leave.\n He said, \"You must have been a very good policeman.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t bad. I had cop instincts, and I learned the moves. That\u0027s at least ninety percent of it.\"\n \"How long were you on the force?\"\n \"Fifteen years. Almost sixteen.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t there a pension or something if you stay twenty?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n He didn\u0027t ask the question, and that was strangely more annoying than if he had.\n I said, \"I lost the faith.\"\n \"Like a priest?\"\n \"Something like that. Not exactly, because it\u0027s not rare for a cop to lose the faith and go on being a cop. He may never have had it in the first place. What it amounted to was that I found out I didn\u0027t want to be a cop anymore.\" Or a husband, or a father. Or a productive member of society.\n \"All the corruption in the department? That sort of thing?\"\n \"No, no.\" The corruption had never bothered me. I would have found it hard to support a family without it. \"No, it was something else.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"You do? Hell, it\u0027s not a secret. I was off duty one night in the summer. I was in a bar in Washington Heights where cops didn\u0027t have to pay for their drinks. Two kids held up the place. On their way out they shot the bartender in the heart. I chased them into the street. I shot one of them dead and caught the other in the thigh. He\u0027s never going to walk right again.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think you do. That wasn\u0027t the first time I ever killed anyone. I was glad the one died and sorry the other recovered.\"\n \"Then-\"\n \"One shot went wide and ricocheted. It hit a seven-year-old girl in the eye. The ricochet took most of the steam off the bullet. An inch higher and it probably would have glanced off her forehead. Would have left a nasty scar but nothing much worse than that. This way, though, nothing but soft tissue, and it went right on into her brain. They tell me she died instantly.\" I looked at my hands. The tremor was barely visible. I picked up my cup and drained it. I said, \"There was no question of culpability. As a matter of fact, I got a departmental commendation. Then I resigned. I just didn\u0027t want to be a cop anymore.\"\n I sat there for a few minutes after he left. Then I caught Trina\u0027s eye and she brought over another cup of laced coffee. \"Your friend\u0027s not much of a drinker,\" she said.\n I agreed that he wasn\u0027t. Something in my tone must have alerted her because she sat down in Hanniford\u0027s chair and put her hand on top of mine for a moment.\n \"Troubles, Matt?\"\n \"Not really. Things to do, and I\u0027d rather not do them.\"\n \"You\u0027d rather just sit here and get drunk.\"\n I grinned at her. \"When did you ever see me drunk?\"\n \"Never. And I never saw you when you weren\u0027t drinking.\"\n \"It\u0027s a nice middle ground.\"\n \"Can\u0027t be good for you, can it?\"\n I wished she would touch my hand again. Her fingers were long and slender, her touch very cool. \"Nothing\u0027s much good for anybody,\" I said.\n \"Coffee and booze. It\u0027s a very weird combination.\"\n \"Is it?\"\n \"Booze to get you drunk, and coffee to keep you sober.\"\n I shook my head. \"Coffee never sobered anybody. It just keeps you awake. Give a drunk plenty of coffee and you\u0027ve got a wide-awake drunk on your hands.\"\n \"That what you are, baby? A wide-awake drunk?\"\n \"I\u0027m neither,\" I told her. \"That\u0027s what keeps me drinking.\"\n I got to my savings bank a little after four. I stuck five hundred in my account and took the rest of Hanniford\u0027s money in cash. It was my first visit since the first of the year, so they entered some interest in my passbook. A machine figured it all out in the wink of an eye. The sum involved was hardly large enough to warrant wasting the machine\u0027s time on it.\n I walked back on Fifty-seventh Street to Ninth, then headed uptown past Armstrong\u0027s and the hospital to St. Paul \u0027s. Mass was just winding up, and I waited outside while a couple dozen people straggled out of the church. They were mostly middle-aged women. Then I went inside and slipped four fifty-dollar bills into the poor box.\n I tithe. I don\u0027t know why. It\u0027s become a habit, as indeed it has become my habit to visit churches. I began doing this shortly after I moved into my hotel room.\n I like churches. I like to sit in them when I have things to think about. I sat around the middle of this one on the aisle. I suppose I was there for twenty minutes, maybe a little longer.\n Two thousand dollars from Cale Hanniford to me, two hundred dollars from me to St. Paul \u0027s poor box. I don\u0027t know what they do with the money. Maybe it buys food and clothing for poor families. Maybe it buys Lincolns for the clergy. I don\u0027t really care what they do with it.\n The Catholics get more of my money than anybody else. Not because I\u0027m partial to them, but because they put in longer hours. Most of the Protestants close up shop during the week.\n One big plus for the Catholics, though. You get to light candles. I lit three on the way out. For Wendy Hanniford, who would never get to be twenty-five, and for Richard Vanderpoel, who would never get to be twenty-one. And, of course, for Estrellita Rivera, who would never get to be eight.\n Chapter 2\n The Sixth Precinct is on West Tenth Street. Eddie Koehler was in his office reading reports when I got there. He didn\u0027t look surprised to see me. He pushed some papers to one side, nodded at the chair alongside his desk. I settled into it and reached over to shake hands with him. Two tens and a five passed smoothly from my hand to his.\n \"You look like you need a new hat,\" I told him.\n \"I do indeed. One thing I can always use is another hat. How\u0027d you like Hanniford?\"\n \"Poor bastard.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s about it. It all happened so quick he\u0027s left standing there with his jaw hanging. That\u0027s what did it for him, you know. The time element. If it takes us a week or a month to make a collar, say. Or if there\u0027s a trial, and it drags on for a year or so. That way things keep going on for him, it gives him a chance to get used to what happened while it\u0027s all still in process. But this way, bam, one thing after another, we got the killer in a cell before he even hears his daughter\u0027s dead, and by the time he gets his ass in gear the kid hangs himself, and Hanniford can\u0027t get used to it because he\u0027s had no time.\" He eyed me speculatively. \"So I figured an old buddy could make a couple of bills out of it.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n He took a cold cigar out of the ashtray and relit it. He could have afforded a fresh one. The Sixth is a hot precinct, and his desk was a good one. He could also have afforded to send Hanniford home instead of referring him to me so that I could knock back twenty-five to him. Old habits die hard.\n \"Get yourself a clipboard, bounce around the neighborhood, ask some questions. Run yourself a week\u0027s work out of it without wasting more\u0027n a couple of hours. Hit him up for a hundred a day plus expenses. That\u0027s close to a K for you, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\n I said, \"I\u0027d like a look at your file on the thing.\"\n \"Why go through the motions? You\u0027re not gonna find anything there, Matt. It was closed before it was opened. We had cuffs on the fucking kid before we even knew what he did.\"\n \"Just for form.\"\n His eyes narrowed just a little. We were about the same age, but I had joined the force earlier and was just getting into plainclothes when he was going through the Academy. Koehler looked a lot older now, droopy in the jowls, and his desk job was spreading him in the seat. There was something about his eyes I didn\u0027t care for.\n \"Waste of time, Matt. Why take the trouble?\"\n \"Let\u0027s say it\u0027s the way I work.\"\n \"Files aren\u0027t open to unauthorized personnel. You know that.\"\n I said, \"Let\u0027s say another hat for a look at what you\u0027ve got. And I\u0027ll want to talk to the arresting officer.\"\n \"I could set that up, arrange an introduction. Whether he wants to talk to you is up to him.\"\n \"Sure.\"\n TWENTY minutes later I was alone in the office. I had twenty-five dollars less in my wallet and a manila folder on the desk in front of me. It didn\u0027t look like good value for the money, didn\u0027t tell me much I didn\u0027t already know.\n Patrolman Lewis Pankow, the arresting officer, led off with his report. I hadn\u0027t read one of those in a while, and it took me back, from \"While proceeding in a westerly direction on routine foot patrol duty\" all the way through to \"at which time the alleged perpetrator was delivered for incarceration to the Men\u0027s House of Detention.\" The Coptic jargon is a special one.\n I read Pankow\u0027s report a couple of times through and took some notes. What it amounted to, in English, was a clear enough statement of facts. At eighteen minutes after four he\u0027d been walking west on Bank Street. He heard sounds of a commotion and shortly encountered some people who told him there was a lunatic on Bethune Street, dancing around with blood all over him. Pankow ran around the block to Bethune Street where he found \"the alleged miscreant, subsequently identified as Richard Vanderpoel of 194 Bethune Street, his clothes in disarray and covered with what appeared to be blood, uttering obscene language at high volume and exposing his private parts to passersby.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-2.html","bookId":2319,"book":{"id":2319,"title":"The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1) \n The hooker was young, pretty...and dead, butchered in a Greenwich village apartment.
