I took the rest in cash, then walked a few blocks to the post office and bought a money order for a few hundred dollars. I addressed an envelope in my hotel room, put a stamp on it, picked up the phone and called Anita.\\n\\n I said, \"I\u0027m sending you a couple of bucks.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that.\"\\n\\n \"Well, to pick out something for the boys. How have they been?\"\\n\\n \"Fine, Matt. They\u0027re in school now, of course. They\u0027ll be sorry they missed your call.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s never much good over the phone, anyway. I was thinking, I could get tickets for the Mets game Friday night. If you could get them to the Coliseum I could send them home in a cab. If you think they\u0027d like to go.\"\\n\\n \"I know they would. I could drive them there with no trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll see if I can pick up tickets. They shouldn\u0027t be too hard to come by.\"\\n\\n \"Should I tell them, or should I wait until you actually have the tickets? Or do you want to tell them yourself?\"\\n\\n \"No, you tell them. In case they have something else lined up.\\n\\n \"They\u0027d cancel anything to see the game with you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, not if it\u0027s something important.\"\\n\\n \"They could even go back to the city with you. You could rent them a room at your hotel and put them on the train the next day.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see.\"\\n\\n \"All right. How have you been, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"Fine. You?\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n \"Things about the same with you and George?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Just wondered.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re still seeing each other if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"He thinking about getting a divorce from Rosalie?\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t talk about it. Matt, I\u0027ve got to go, they\u0027re honking for me.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"And let me know about the tickets.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t in the early Post, but around two in the afternoon I had the radio on to one of the all-news stations and they had it. The Reverend Martin Vanderpoel, minister of the First Reformed Church of Bay Ridge, had been found dead in his bedroom by his housekeeper. The death had been tentatively attributed, pending autopsy, to the voluntary ingestion of an overdose of barbiturates. Reverend Vanderpoel was identified as the father of Richard Vanderpoel, who had recently hanged himself after having been arrested for the murder of Wendy Hanniford in the apartment the two had shared in Greenwich Village. Reverend Vanderpoel was reported to have been profoundly despondent over his son\u0027s death, and this despondency had evidently led him to take his own life.\\n\\n I turned off the radio and sat around for half an hour or so. Then I walked around the block to St. Paul\u0027s and put a hundred dollars in the poor box, a tenth of what I\u0027d received as a bonus from Cale Hanniford.\\n\\n I sat near the back for a while, thinking about a lot of things.\\n\\n Before I left I lit four candles. One for Wendy, one for Richie, the usual one for Estrellita Rivera.\\n\\n And one for Martin Vanderpoel, of course. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1/page-23.html","bookId":2319,"book":{"id":2319,"title":"The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1)","description":"Storyline: The Sins of the Fathers (Matthew Scudder #1) \\n The hooker was young, pretty...and dead, butchered in a Greenwich village apartment. The prime suspect, a minister\u0027s son, was also dead, the victim of a jailhouse suicide. The case is closed, as far as the NYPD is concerned. Now the murdered prostitute\u0027s father wants it opened again-and that\u0027s where Matthew Scudder comes in. But this assignment carries the unmistakable stench of sleaze and perversion, luring ex-cop-turned-investigator Scudder into a sordid world of phony religion and murderous lust where children must die for their parents most secret, unspeakable sins.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:24:27 PM"}}
