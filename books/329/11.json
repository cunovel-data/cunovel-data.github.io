{"id":22867,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainiy was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.\\n\\n Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.\\n\\n Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved goodby to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head.\\n\\n \"Pretty nice, eh?\"\\n\\n \"These Basques are swell people,\" Bill said.\\n\\n The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddleleather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. He shoved the wine-bag up.\\n\\n \"Arriba! Arriba!\" he said. \"Lift it up.\"\\n\\n Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.\\n\\n \"No! No!\" several Basques said. \"Not like that.\" One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms\u0027 length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" the owner of the bottle shouted. \"Whose wine is that?\"\\n\\n The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.\\n\\n We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.\\n\\n We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses.\\n\\n The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.\\n\\n We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.\\n\\n Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mailpouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.\\n\\n The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: \"You\u0027re Americans?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"I been there,\" he said. \"Forty years ago.\"\\n\\n He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard.\\n\\n \"How was it?\"\\n\\n \"What you say?\"\\n\\n \"How was America?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I was in California. It was fine.\"\\n\\n \"Why did you leave?\"\\n\\n \"What you say?\"\\n\\n \"Why did you come back here?\"\\n\\n \"Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don\u0027t like to travel. Where you from?\"\\n\\n \"Kansas City.\"\\n\\n \"I been there,\" he said. \"I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City.\"\\n\\n He named them carefully.\\n\\n \"How long were you over?\"\\n\\n \"Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.\"\\n\\n \"Have a drink?\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said. \"You can\u0027t get this in America, eh?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s plenty if you can pay for it.\"\\n\\n \"What you come over here for?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to the fiesta at Pamplona.\"\\n\\n \"You like the bull-fights?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"I guess I like them.\"\\n\\n Then after a little:\\n\\n \"Where you go now?\"\\n\\n \"Up to Burguete to fish.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" he said, \"I hope you catch something.\"\\n\\n He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.\\n\\n The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s Roncevaux,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"Way off there where the mountain starts.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s cold up here,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s high,\" I said. \"It must be twelve hundred metres.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s awful cold,\" Bill said.\\n\\n The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the schoolyard, and the bus stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s in there?\" he pointed to the rod-case.\\n\\n I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on.\\n\\n \"Is that all right?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. Of course.\"\\n\\n We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.\\n\\n The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again. It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Se?ora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oakpanelled. The shutters were all up and it was so cold you could see your breath.\\n\\n \"My God!\" said Bill. \"It can\u0027t be this cold to-morrow. I\u0027m not going to wade a stream in this weather.\"\\n\\n There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play.\\n\\n \"I got to keep warm,\" he said.\\n\\n I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me.\\n\\n \"Twelve pesetas.\"\\n\\n \"Why, we only paid that in Pamplona.\"\\n\\n She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s too much,\" I said. \"We didn\u0027t pay more than that at a big hotel.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve put in a bathroom.\"\\n\\n \"Haven\u0027t you got anything cheaper?\"\\n\\n \"Not in the summer. Now is the big season.\"\\n\\n We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it\u0027s only a few days.\\n\\n \"Is the wine included?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said. \"It\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. \"How about a hot rum punch?\" he said. \"This isn\u0027t going to keep me warm permanently.\"\\n\\n I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it. In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind.\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t too much rum in that.\"\\n\\n I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher.\\n\\n \"Direct action,\" said Bill. \"It beats legislation.\"\\n\\n The girl came in and laid the table for supper.\\n\\n \"It blows like hell up here,\" Bill said.\\n\\n The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it. The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.\\n\\n After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed.\\n\\n \\n\\n 午饭后，当我们背着旅行包和钓竿袋出来动身到布尔戈特去的时候，广场上热得烤人。公共汽车顶层已经有人了，另外有些人正攀着梯子往上爬。比尔爬上顶层，罗伯特坐在比尔身边给我占座，我走回旅馆去拿两三瓶酒随身带着。等我出来，车上已拥挤不堪。顶层上所有的行李和箱子上都坐满了男女旅客，妇女们在阳光下用扇子扇个不停。天实在热。罗伯特爬下车去，我在横跨顶层的木制长椅上他刚才替我占的位置落了座。\\n\\n 罗伯特.科恩站在拱廊下面阴凉的地方等着我们启程。有个巴斯克人怀里揣着一个大皮酒袋，横躺在顶层我们长椅的前面，背靠着我们的腿儿。他把酒袋递给比尔和我，我把酒袋倒过来正要喝的当儿，他模仿汽车电喇叭，嘟嘟的叫了一声，学得那么逼真而且来得那么突然，使我把酒泼掉了一些，大家哈哈大笑。他表示歉意，让我再喝一次。一会儿他又学了一遍，我再次上当。他学得非常象。巴斯克人喜欢听他学。坐在比尔旁边的人跟比尔说西班牙语，但比尔听不懂，所以就拿一瓶酒递给这人。这人挥手拒绝了。他说天太热，而且中饭时他喝过量了。当比尔第二次递给他的时候，他咕嘟嘟地喝了一大口，然后这酒瓶在就近几个人手里传开了。每个人都非常斯文地喝上一口，然后他们叫我们把酒瓶塞好收起来。他们都要我们喝他们自己皮酒袋里的酒。他们是到山区去的农民。\\n\\n 又响了几次模仿的喇叭声之后，汽车终于开动了，罗伯特.科恩挥手向我们告别，所有的巴斯克人也挥手向他告别。我们一开上城外的大道，就凉快了。高坐在车顶，紧贴着树下行驶，感到很惬意。汽车开得很快，激起阵阵凉风。当我们顺着大道直驶，尘土扑打在树上，并向山下飘落时，我们回头穿过枝叶看到耸立在河边峭壁上的那个城市的美好风光。靠在我膝盖上躺着的巴斯克人用酒瓶口指点着这景色，向我们使眼色。他点点头。\\n\\n “很美吧，呃？”\\n\\n “这些巴斯克人满不错，”比尔说。\\n\\n 靠在我腿上躺着的巴斯克人皮肤黝黑，象皮马鞍的颜色。他同其他巴斯克人一样，穿一件黑色罩衫。黝黑的脖子上布满皱纹。他转身要比尔接过他的酒袋。比尔递给他一瓶我们带的酒。巴斯克人用食指朝比尔比划了两下，用手掌啪的拍上瓶塞，递回酒瓶。他使劲把酒袋朝上递。\\n\\n “举起来！举起来！”他说。“举起酒袋来。”\\n\\n 比尔举起酒袋，把头向后一仰，让酒迸发出来，射进他的嘴里。他喝罢酒，放平酒袋，有几滴酒顺着他的下颏往下淌。\\n\\n “不对！不对！”有几个巴斯克人说。“不是那么喝的。”酒袋的主人正要亲自给比尔做示范，另一个人从他手里把它抢过去了。这是一位年轻小伙，他伸直双臂，高高举起酒袋，用一只手捏着这皮袋，于是酒就咝咝地射进他的嘴里。他伸手高擎着酒袋，袋中的酒顺着平射的轨道猛烈地喷进他的嘴里，他不紧不慢地一口口把酒咽下。\\n\\n “嗨！”酒袋的主人喊道。“你喝的是谁的酒啊？”\\n\\n 喝酒的小伙用小手指对他点点，眼睛里带着笑意，看看我们。然后他突然刹住酒流，倏的把酒袋朝天竖直，朝下送到主人的手里。他向我们眨巴几下眼睛。主人沮丧地晃了晃酒袋。\\n\\n 我们穿过一座小镇，在一家旅店门前停下，司机装上几件包裹。然后我们又上路，驶出小镇，公路开始向山上攀登。我们穿行在庄稼地里，这里有岩石嶙峋的小山岗，山坡朝下没在地里。庄稼地沿山坡向上伸展。现在我们爬得比较高了，风儿摆动着庄稼。大路白茫茫地满是尘土，尘土被车轮扬起，弥漫在车后的空中。公路攀登上山，把长势茂盛的庄稼地抛在下面。现在光秃的山坡上和河道两侧只有零星的几块庄稼地。车子急剧地闪到大路边，给一长列由六头骡子组成的队伍让道，骡子一头跟着一头，拉着一辆满载货物的高篷大车。车上和骡子身上都是尘土。紧接着又是一队骡子和一辆大车。这一车拉的是木材，我们开过的时候，赶骡的车夫向后一靠，扳上粗大的木闸，把车刹住。在这儿一带，土地相当荒芜，满山顽石，烤硬的泥上被雨水冲出道道沟壑。\\n\\n 我们顺着一条弯道，驶进一个小镇，两侧陡的展开一片开阔的绿色的山谷。一条小溪穿过小镇中心，房屋后边紧接着一片片葡萄园。\\n\\n 汽车在一家旅店门前停下，许多旅客下了车，好些行李从车顶大油布底下被解开并卸了下来。比尔和我下车走进旅店。这是一间又矮又暗的屋子，放着马鞍、马具和白杨木制的干草叉，屋顶上挂着一串串绳底帆布鞋、火腿、腊肉、白色的蒜头和长长的红肠，屋里阴凉、幽暗，我们站在长条的木头柜台前，有两名妇女在柜台后面卖酒。她们背后是塞满杂货商品的货架。我们每人喝了一杯白酒，两杯白酒共计四十生丁。我给了女掌柜五十生丁，多余的算小费，但是她以为我听错价钱了，把那个铜币还给我。\\n\\n 两位同路的巴斯克人走进来，一定要请我们喝酒。他们给每人买了一杯酒，随后我们买了一次，后来他们拍拍我们的脊背，又买了一次。我们接着买了一次，最后我们一起走出来，到了火热的阳光下，爬上车去。这时候有的是空座，大家都可以坐到，那个刚才躺在铅皮车顶上的巴斯克人这时在我们俩中间坐下了，卖酒的女掌柜用围裙擦着手走出来，和汽车里的一个人说话，司机晃着两个皮制空邮袋走出旅店，爬上汽车，车子开动了，车下的人都向我们挥手。\\n\\n 大道瞬间就离开绿色的上谷，我们又驶进丛山之间。比尔和抱着酒袋的巴斯克人在聊天。有一个人从椅子背后探身过来用英语问我们：“你们是美国人？”\\n\\n “是啊。”\\n\\n “我在那里待过，”他说。“四十年前。”\\n\\n 他是个老头，皮肤黑得同其他人一样，留着短短的白胡子。\\n\\n “那里怎么样？”\\n\\n “你说什么？”\\n\\n “美国怎么样？”“哦，我当时在加利福尼亚。好地方。”“你为什么离开呢？”“你说什么？”“为什么回到这里来了？”“哦，我回来结婚的。我本来打算再去，可我老婆她不爱出门。你是什么地方人？”“堪萨斯城人。”\\n\\n “我到过，”他说。“我到过芝加哥、圣路易、堪萨斯城、丹佛、洛杉矶、盐湖城。”\\n\\n 他很仔细地念着这些地名。\\n\\n “你在美国待了多长时间？”\\n\\n “十五年。然后我就回来结婚了。”\\n\\n “喝口酒吧？”\\n\\n “好，”他说。“你在美国喝不到这种酒吧，呃？”\\n\\n “只要你买得起，那里有的是。”\\n\\n “你上这儿干什么来啦？”\\n\\n “我们到潘普洛纳来过节。”\\n\\n “你喜欢看斗牛？”\\n\\n “那当然。难道你不喜欢？”\\n\\n “喜欢，”他说。“我看我是喜欢的。”\\n\\n 过了一会儿，又说：\\n\\n “你现在上哪儿？”\\n\\n “到布尔戈特钓鱼去。”\\n\\n “好，”他说，“愿你能钓到大鱼。”\\n\\n 他同我握握手，转身重新在背后的座上坐好。他同我的谈话引起其他巴斯克人的注目。他舒舒服服地坐好了，每当我回头观望山乡风光的时候，他总对我微笑。但是刚才费劲地说了一通美国英语似乎把他累着了。后来他再也没说什么。\\n\\n 汽车沿公路不断地向上爬，山地荒芜贫瘠，大小岩石破土突起。路旁寸草不长。回头看，只见山下展现一片开阔的原野。在原野后面遥远的山坡上是一块块翠绿和棕黄色相间的田地。褐色的群山同天际相连。山形奇特。每登高一步，天际群山的轮廓也随之而改变。随着汽车沿公路缓缓攀登，我们看到另一些山峦出现在南边。公路接着越过山顶，渐渐转为平坦，驶进一片树林。这是一片软木懈树林，阳光穿过枝叶斑斑驳驳地射进来，牛群在树林深处吃草。我们穿出树林，公路顺着一个高岗拐弯，前头是一片起伏的绿色平原，再过去是黛色的群山。这些山和那些被我们甩在后面的被烤焦了的褐色山峦不同。山上树木丛生、云雾缭绕。绿色平原朝前伸展着，被栅栏割成一块块，两道纵贯平原直指北方的树行之间显现出一条白色的大道。当我们来到高岗的边缘，我们看见前边平原上布尔戈特的一连串红顶白墙的房屋，在远处第一座黛色的山岗上，闪现出龙塞斯瓦列斯的修道院的灰色铁皮房顶。\\n\\n “那边就是龙塞沃，”我说。\\n\\n “哪儿？”\\n\\n “那边数过去第一座山上就是。”\\n\\n “这几天气很冷，”比尔说。\\n\\n “地势很高嘛，”我说。“海拔该有一千二百米吧。”\\n\\n “冷死了，”比尔说。汽车驶下山岗，开在奔向布尔戈特的笔直的公路上。我们通过一个十字路口，越过一座架在小溪上的桥。布尔戈特的房屋沿公路两边伸延、一条支巷也没有。我们驶过教堂和学校校园，汽车停下来。我们下了车，司机递给我们旅行包和钓竿袋。一名头戴三角帽，身上佩着交叉黄皮带的缉私警察走上前来，\\n\\n “那里头是什么？”他指指钓竿袋。\\n\\n 我打开钓竿袋给他看。他要求出示我们的钓鱼许可证，我就掏出来。他看了一下日期，就挥手让我们通过。\\n\\n “这就完事了？”我问。\\n\\n “是的。那还用说。”\\n\\n 我们顺着大街向旅店走去，一路上走过一些白灰粉刷的石头房子，一家家人家坐在自家门口看着我们。\\n\\n 开旅店的胖女人从厨房出来同我们握手。她摘下眼镜，擦擦干净，再把它戴上。旅店里很冷，外面起风了。女掌柜打发一名使女陪我们上楼去看房间。屋里有两张床、一个脸盆架、一个衣柜，另外还有一幅镶在大镜框里的龙塞斯瓦列斯圣母的钢版画。风吹打着百叶窗。这间房位于旅店的北部。我们梳洗完毕，穿上毛衣，下楼走进餐厅。餐厅地面铺着石块，天花板很低，墙上镶着栎木壁板。百叶窗全部关着，屋里冷得能看到自己嘴里呵出的热气。\\n\\n “我的上帝！”比尔说。“明天可不能这么冷。这种天气我可不愿下河趟水。”\\n\\n 隔着几张木制餐桌，屋子尽头的角落里有一台竖式钢琴，比尔走过去弹奏起来。\\n\\n “我非得暖和一下身子不可，”他说。\\n\\n 我出去找女掌柜，问她食宿费每天要多少。她把双手插在围裙下面，连望也不望我一眼。\\n\\n “十二比塞塔。”“怎么，在潘普洛纳我们也只花这么些钱。”她不做声，光是摘下她的眼镜，在围裙上擦着。“太贵了，”我说。“我们住大旅馆也只不过花这么多钱。”“我们把浴室算在内了。”“你们有没有便宜点的房间？”“夏天没有。现在正是旺季。”旅店里只有我们这两个旅客。算了，我想，反正只住那么几天。\\n\\n “酒也包括在内吗？”\\n\\n “哦，是的。”“行，”我说。“就这样吧。”\\n\\n 我回到比尔身边。他对准我呵气，来说明屋里多冷，接着又继续弹琴。我坐在一张桌子边看墙上的画。有一幅上画着些兔子，都是死兔子，另一幅是些雉鸡，也是死的，还有一幅画的是些死鸭子。画面全都色泽暗淡，好象是让烟给熏黑了。食柜里装满了瓶酒。我一瓶瓶地看了一遍。比尔一直在弹琴。“来杯热的混合甜酒怎么样？”他说。“弹琴取暖挺不了多长时间。”\\n\\n 我走出屋去告诉女掌柜什么叫混合甜酒，怎么做。几分钟之后，一名侍女端着一个热气腾腾的陶罐进屋来了。比尔从钢琴边走过来，我们一边喝热甜酒，一边听着呼呼的风声。\\n\\n “这里头没多少朗姆酒啊。”\\n\\n 我走到食柜前，拿了一瓶朗姆酒，往酒罐里倒了半杯。\\n\\n “好一个直接行动，”比尔说。“比申请批准强啊。”\\n\\n 侍女进屋摆桌子准备开饭。\\n\\n “这里风刮得地震山摇，”比尔说。侍女端来一大碗热菜汤，还有葡萄酒。后来我们吃了煎鳟鱼，一道炖菜和满满一大碗野草莓。我们在酒钱上没吃亏。侍女很腼腆，但是愿意给我们拿酒。老太太来看过一次，数了数空酒瓶。\\n\\n 吃完饭我们就上楼了，为了好暖和些，我们躺在床上抽烟，看报。半夜里我醒过来一次，听见刮风的声音。躺在热被窝里很舒服。\\n\\n \\n\\n
