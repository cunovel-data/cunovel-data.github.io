{"id":22874,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bullfight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twentyfive Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.\\n\\n The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other\u0027s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.\\n\\n \"Here comes Brett,\" Bill said.\\n\\n I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing.\\n\\n \"Hello, you chaps!\" she said. \"I say, I _have_ a thirst.\"\\n\\n \"Get another big beer,\" Bill said to the waiter.\\n\\n \"Shrimps?\"\\n\\n \"Is Cohn gone?\" Brett asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Bill said. \"He hired a car.\"\\n\\n The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip.\\n\\n \"Good beer.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control.\\n\\n \"I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake,\" Brett said.\\n\\n \"No. Knocked me out. That was all.\"\\n\\n \"I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero,\" Brett said. \"He hurt him most badly.\"\\n\\n \"How is he?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be all right. He won\u0027t go out of the room.\"\\n\\n \"Does he look badly?\"\\n\\n \"Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"Is he going to fight?\"\\n\\n \"Rather. I\u0027m going with you, if you don\u0027t mind.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s your boy friend?\" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said.\\n\\n \"Brett\u0027s got a bull-fighter,\" he said. \"She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly.\"\\n\\n Brett stood up.\\n\\n \"I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s your boy friend?\"\\n\\n \"Damned well,\" Brett said. \"Watch him this afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Brett\u0027s got a bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"A beautiful, bloody bullfighter.\"\\n\\n \"Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Tell him all about your bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!\" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dIsh of shrimps went over in a crash.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Brett said. \"Let\u0027s get out of this.\"\\n\\n In the crowd crossing the square I said: \"How is it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They\u0027re very angry about me, he says.\"\\n\\n Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright.\\n\\n \"I feel altogether changed,\" Brett said. \"You\u0027ve no idea, Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Anything you want me to do?\"\\n\\n \"No, just go to the fight with me.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see you at lunch?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m eating with him.\"\\n\\n We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade.\\n\\n \"Want to take a turn out to the park?\" Brett asked. \"I don\u0027t want to go up yet. I fancy he\u0027s sleeping.\"\\n\\n We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let\u0027s go there,\" Brett said. \"I don\u0027t want staring at just now.\"\\n\\n We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea.\\n\\n \"I hope the wind goes down,\" Brett said. \"It\u0027s very bad for him.\"\\n\\n \"So do I.\"\\n\\n \"He says the bulls are all right.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re good.\"\\n\\n \"Is that San Fermin\u0027s?\"\\n\\n Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel.\\n\\n \"Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go in. Do you mind? I\u0027d rather like to pray a little for him or something.\"\\n\\n We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" she whispered throatily. \"Let\u0027s get out of here. Makes me damned nervous.\"\\n\\n Outside in the hot brightness of the Street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know why I get so nervy in church,\" Brett said. \"Never does me any good.\"\\n\\n We walked along.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m damned bad for a religious atmosphere,\" Brett said. \"I\u0027ve the wrong type of face.\\n\\n \"You know,\" Brett said, \"I\u0027m not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n \"I wish the wind would drop, though.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s liable to go down by five o\u0027clock.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hope.\"\\n\\n \"You might pray,\" I laughed.\\n\\n \"Never does me any good. I\u0027ve never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, rot,\" said Brett. \"Maybe it works for some people, though you don\u0027t look very religious, Jake.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m pretty religious.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, rot,\" said Brett. \"Don\u0027t start proselyting to-day. To-day\u0027s going to be bad enough as it is.\"\\n\\n It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating.\\n\\n \"Do look after Mike,\" Brett said. \"Don\u0027t let him get too bad.\"\\n\\n \"Your frients haff gone up-stairs,\" the German ma?tre d\u0027h?tel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:\\n\\n \"Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?\"\\n\\n \"No, _ma\u0027am_.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Brett.\\n\\n \"Save us a table for three,\" I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile.\\n\\n \"Iss madam eating here?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Brett said.\\n\\n \"Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t talk to him,\" Brett said. \"Mike must have been in bad shape,\" she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you at the café,\" Brett said. \"Thank you, so much, Jake.\"\\n\\n We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hail and into Romero\u0027s room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.\\n\\n I stood in front of the door of Mike\u0027s room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me.\\n\\n \"Hello, Jake,\" he said very slowly. \"I\u0027m getting a lit tle sleep. I\u0027ve want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Let me cover you over.\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m quite warm.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go. I have n\u0027t got ten to sleep yet.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll sleep, Mike. Don\u0027t worry, boy.\"\\n\\n \"Brett\u0027s got a bull-fighter,\" Mike said. \"But her Jew has gone away.\"\\n\\n He turned his head and looked at me.\\n\\n \"Damned good thing, what?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just start ing. I\u0027m go ing to get a lit tie sleep.\"\\n\\n He shut his eyes. I went Out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper.\\n\\n \"See Mike?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go and eat.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.\"\\n\\n \"He was snotty to us, too.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go out and eat in the town.\"\\n\\n We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray.\\n\\n \"There goes Brett\u0027s lunch,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"And the kid\u0027s,\" I said.\\n\\n Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite.\\n\\n \"I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Go sit at it,\" Bill said. We went on out across the street.\\n\\n We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.\\n\\n When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow. It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth. The swordhandlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,\" she said. \"Why do they call them muletas?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder if they ever launder them.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so. It might spoil the color.\"\\n\\n \"The blood must stiffen them,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"Funny,\" Brett said. \"How one doesn\u0027t mind the blood.\"\\n\\n Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President\u0027s box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.\\n\\n \"Here, would you like to look?\"\\n\\n I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. Beimonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses.\\n\\n \"Here, take them,\" she said.\\n\\n Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President\u0027s box, and then came over to the barrera beiow us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero\u0027s lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape.\\n\\n \"Spread it out in front of you,\" I said.\\n\\n Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t want you to spread it,\" he said. \"You should fold it and keep it in your lap.\"\\n\\n Brett folded the heavy cape.\\n\\n Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" Brett asked.\\n\\n \"To give it weight in the wind.\"\\n\\n \"His face looks bad,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"He feels very badly,\" Brett said. \"He should be in bed.\"\\n\\n The first bull was Belmonte\u0027s. Belmonte was very good. But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good. Belmonte\u0027s great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.\\n\\n Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte\u0027s jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs. His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, longjawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.\\n\\n Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false aesthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls withoui much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.\\n\\n Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.\\n\\n His first \"quite\" was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Be!monte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull\u0027s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull\u0027s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull\u0027s shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.\\n\\n The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull\u0027s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero\u0027s cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.\\n\\n In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t they change him?\" Brett asked.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve paid for him. They don\u0027t want to lose their money.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hardly fair to Romero.\"\\n\\n \"Watch how he handles a bull that can\u0027t see the color.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the sort of thing I don\u0027t like to see.\"\\n\\n It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull\u0027s charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not like it. They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull\u0027s charge from his own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte\u0027s imitation of himself or Marcial\u0027s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row behind us.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he afraid of the bull for? The bull\u0027s so dumb he only goes after the cloth.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just a young bull-fighter. He hasn\u0027t learned it yet.\"\\n\\n \"But I thought he was fine with the cape before.\"\\n\\n \"Probably he\u0027s nervous now.\"\\n\\n Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with that little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to kill now,\" I said to Brett. \"The bull\u0027s still strong. He wouldn\u0027t wear himself out.\"\\n\\n Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero\u0027s left hand dropped the muleta over the bull\u0027s muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull\u0027s shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling.\\n\\n \"There he goes,\" Bill said.\\n\\n Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.\\n\\n They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President\u0027s box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta.\\n\\n \"Bad one,\" said the sword-handler.\\n\\n \"He made me sweat,\" said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink Out of the jug. He did not look up at us.\\n\\n Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero\u0027s last bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.\\n\\n During Romero\u0027s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.\\n\\n When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.\\n\\n The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero\u0027s older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull\u0027s neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. Romero\u0027s brother, holding the bull\u0027s horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President\u0027s box. Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bullring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull.\\n\\n Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape.\\n\\n \"You liked it?\" Romero called.\\n\\n Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get bloody,\" Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people\u0027s shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody\u0027s shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.\\n\\n We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went upstairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o\u0027clock train for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions.\\n\\n Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bullfight very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike.\\n\\n \"Come on over to the café,\" Bill said. \"I want an absinthe.\"\\n\\n It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Edna?\" I asked Bill.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter.\\n\\n \"I feel sorry about Cohn,\" Bill said. \"He had an awful time.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, to hell with Cohn,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Where do you suppose he went?\"\\n\\n \"Up to Paris.\"\\n\\n \"What do you suppose he\u0027ll do?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, to hell with him.\"\\n\\n \"What do you suppose he\u0027ll do?\"\\n\\n \"Pick up with his old girl, probably.\"\\n\\n \"Who was his old girl?\"\\n\\n \"Somebody named Frances.\"\\n\\n We had another absinthe.\\n\\n \"When do you go back?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"To-morrow.\"\\n\\n After a little while Bill said: \"Well, it was a swell fiesta.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, \"something doing all the time.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it. It\u0027s like a wonderful nightmare.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said. \"I\u0027d believe anything. Including nightmares.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter? Feel low?\"\\n\\n \"Low as hell.\"\\n\\n \"Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this se?or.\"\\n\\n \"I feel like hell,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Drink that,\" said Bill. \"Drink it slow.\"\\n\\n It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better.\\n\\n \"How do you feel?\"\\n\\n \"I feel like hell.\"\\n\\n \"Have another?\"\\n\\n \"It won\u0027t do any good.\"\\n\\n \"Try it. You can\u0027t tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this se?or!\"\\n\\n I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture.\\n\\n \"How is it?\"\\n\\n \"Fine.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t drink it fast that way. It will make you sick.\"\\n\\n I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast.\\n\\n \"I feel tight.\"\\n\\n \"You ought to.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what you wanted, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m tight. Is that what you want?\"\\n\\n \"Sit down.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t sit down,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going over to the hotel.\"\\n\\n I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett\u0027s door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle.\\n\\n \"Jake,\" he said. \"Come in, Jake.\"\\n\\n I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point.\\n\\n \"Brett, you know. She\u0027s gone off with the bull-fighter chap.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o\u0027clock train.\"\\n\\n \"Did they?\"\\n\\n \"Bad thing to do,\" Mike said. \"She shouldn\u0027t have done it.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m drunk,\" I said. \"I\u0027m going in and lie down.\"\\n\\n \"Are you blind? I was blind myself.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, \"I\u0027m blind.\"\\n\\n \"Well, bung-o,\" Mike said. \"Get some sleep, old Jake.\"\\n\\n I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s asleep. Better let him alone.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s blind as a tick,\" Mike said. They went out.\\n\\n I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room.\\n\\n \"Here he is!\" said Bill. \"Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn\u0027t pass out.\"\\n\\n \"Hello, you old drunk,\" Mike said.\\n\\n \"I got hungry and woke up.\"\\n\\n \"Eat some soup,\" Bill said.\\n\\n The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing.\\n\\n \\n\\n 中午时分，我们会集在咖啡馆里。里头人头挤挤。我们吃小虾，喝啤酒。城里也满是人。条条街道都挤得满满的。从比亚里茨和圣塞瓦斯蒂安来的大汽车不断地开到，停在广场周围。汽车把人们送来观看斗牛。旅游车也到了。有一辆车里坐着二十五名英籍妇女。她们坐在这辆白色的大汽车里，用望远镜观赏这里的节日风光。跳舞的人都喝得醉醺醺的。这是节期的最后一天。\\n\\n 参加节日活动的人们挤得水泄不通，川流不息，但汽车和旅游车边却围着一圈圈观光者。等汽车上的人全下来了，他们便淹没在人群之中。你再也见不着他们，只有在咖啡馆的桌子边，在拥挤不堪的穿着黑色外衣的农民中间，能见到他们那与众不同的运动服。节日洪流甚至淹没了从比亚里茨来的英国人，以至你如果不紧靠一张桌子边走过，就看不到他们。街上乐声不绝。鼓声咚咚，笛声悠扬。在咖啡馆里，人们双手紧抓住桌子，或者互相接着肩膀，直着嗓门唱歌。\\n\\n “勃莱特来了，”比尔说。\\n\\n 我一看，只见她正穿过广场上的人群走来，高高地昂着头，似乎这次节日狂欢是为了对她表示敬意才举行的，她感到又自得，又好笑。\\n\\n “喂，朋友们！”她说。“嗨，渴死我了。”\\n\\n “再来一大杯啤酒，”比尔对侍者说。\\n\\n “要小虾吗？”\\n\\n “科恩走了？”勃莱特问。\\n\\n “是的，”比尔说。“他雇了一辆汽车。”\\n\\n 啤酒送来了。勃莱特伸手去端玻璃杯，她的手颤抖着。她自己发觉了，微微一笑，便俯身喝了一大口。“好酒。”“非常好，”我说。我正为迈克惴惴不安。我想他根本没有睡觉。他大概一直在喝酒，但是看来他还能控制得住自己。“我听说科恩把你打伤了， 杰克， ”勃莱特说。“没有。把我打昏过去了。别的没啥。”“我说，他把佩德罗.罗梅罗打伤了，”勃莱特说。“伤得好厉害。”“他现在怎么样？”“他就会好的。他不愿意离开房间。”“他看来很糟糕？”“非常糟糕。他真的伤得很重。我跟他说，我想溜出来看你们一下。”“他还要上场吗？”“当然。如果你愿意的话，我想同你一起去。”“你男朋友怎么样啦？”迈克问。勃莱特刚才说的话他一点没听着。“勃莱特搞上了一个斗牛士，”他说。“她还有个姓科恩的犹太人，可他结果表现得糟透了。”勃莱特站起身来。\\n\\n “我不想再听你讲这种混帐话了，迈克尔。”\\n\\n “你男朋友怎么样啦？”\\n\\n “好得很哩，”勃莱特说。“下午好好看他斗牛吧。”\\n\\n “勃莱特搞上了一个斗牛士，”迈克说。“一个标致的该死的斗牛士。”\\n\\n “请你陪我走回去好吗？我有话对你说，杰克。”\\n\\n “把你那斗牛士的事儿都对他说吧，”迈克说。“哼，让你那斗牛士见鬼去吧！”他把桌子一掀，于是桌上所有的啤酒杯和虾碟都泻在地上，哗啦啦地摔个粉碎。\\n\\n “走吧，”勃莱特说。“我们离开这里。”\\n\\n 挤在人群中间穿过广场的时候，我说：“情况怎么样？”\\n\\n “午饭后到他上场之前我不准备见他，他的随从们要来给他上装。他说，他们非常生我的气。”勃莱特满面春风。她很高兴。太阳出来了，天色亮堂堂的。“我觉得自己完全变了，”勃莱特说。“你想象不到，杰克。”\\n\\n “你需要我干什么？”\\n\\n “没什么，只想叫你陪我看斗牛去。”\\n\\n “午饭时你来？”\\n\\n “不。我跟他一块吃。”\\n\\n 我们在旅馆门口的拱廊下面站住了。他们正把桌子搬出来安置在拱廊下面。\\n\\n “想不想到公园里去走走？”勃莱特问。“我还不想上楼。我看他在睡觉。”\\n\\n 我们打剧院门前走过，出了广场，一直穿过市集上临时搭的棚子，随着人流在两行售货亭中间走着。我们走上一条通向萨拉萨特步行街的横街，我们望得见人们在步行街上漫步，穿着入时的人们全在那里了。他们绕着公园那一头散步。\\n\\n “我们别上那边去，”勃莱特说：“眼前我不愿意让人盯着看。”\\n\\n 我们在阳光下站着。海上刮来乌云，雨过天晴之后，天气热得很爽。\\n\\n “我希望不要再刮风了，”勃莱特说。“刮风对他很不利。”\\n\\n “我也希望这样。”\\n\\n “他说牛都不错。”\\n\\n “都很好。”\\n\\n “那座是不是圣福明礼拜堂？”\\n\\n 勃莱特望着礼拜堂的黄墙。\\n\\n “是的。星期天的游行就是从这里出发的。”\\n\\n “我们进去看看。愿意吗？我很想为他做个祈祷什么的。”\\n\\n 我们走进一扇包着皮革的门，它虽然很厚实，但开起来却非常轻便。堂里很暗。许多人在做祷告。等眼睛适应了幽暗的光线，你就能够看清他们。我们跪在一条木制长凳前。过了一会儿，我发觉勃莱特在我旁边挺直了腰板，看见她的眼睛直勾勾地望着前面。\\n\\n “走吧，”她用嘶哑的声音悄悄说。“我们离开这里吧。使我的神经好紧张。”\\n\\n 到了外面，在灼热阳光照耀下的大街上，勃莱特抬头凝视随风摇曳的树梢。祈祷没有起多大作用。\\n\\n “不明白我在教堂里为什么总这么紧张，”勃莱特说。“祈祷对我从来没有用。”\\n\\n 我们一路往前走。“我同宗教气氛是格格不入的，”勃莱特说。“我的脸型长得不对头。\\n\\n “你知道，”勃莱特又说，“我根本不替他担心，我只是为他感到幸福。”\\n\\n “这敢情好，”\\n\\n “但是我盼望风小一点。”\\n\\n “五点钟左右风势往往会减弱。”\\n\\n “但愿如此。”\\n\\n “你可以祈祷嘛，”我笑着说。\\n\\n “对我从来没用，我从来也没得到过祈祷的好处。你得到过吗？”\\n\\n “哦，有过。”\\n\\n “胡说，”勃莱特说，“不过对某些人来说可能灵验。你看来也不怎么虔诚嘛，杰克。”\\n\\n “我很虔诚。”\\n\\n “胡说，”勃莱特说。“你今天别来劝诱人家信教这一套啦。今天这个日子看来会是够倒霉的。”\\n\\n 自从她和科恩出走之日起，我还是头一次看到她又象过去那么快快活活、无忧无虑。我们折回到旅馆门前。所有的桌子都摆好了，有几张桌子已经有人坐着在吃饭了。\\n\\n “你看着点迈克，”勃莱特说。“别让他太放肆了。”“你的朋友们已经上楼了，”德国籍的侍者总管用英语说。他一贯偷听别人说话。勃莱特朝他说：“太谢谢了。你还有什么话要说的？”“没有了，夫人。”“好，”勃莱特说。\\n\\n “给我们留一张三个人坐的桌子，”我对德国人说。他那张贼眉鼠眼、内里透红的脸绽出了笑容。“夫人在这儿用餐？”\\n\\n “不，”勃莱特说。\\n\\n “那我看双人桌也就够了。”\\n\\n “别跟他罗嗦，”勃莱特说。“迈克大概情绪很不好，”上楼的时候她说。在楼梯上，我们和蒙托亚打了个照面。他鞠躬致意，但脸上毫无笑意。\\n\\n “咖啡馆里再见，”勃莱特说。“太感谢你了，杰克。”\\n\\n 我们走上我们住的那一层楼。她顺着走廊径直走迸罗梅罗的房间。她没有敲门。她干脆推开房门，走进去，就随手带上了门。\\n\\n 我站在迈克的房门前，敲了敲门。没有回音。我拧拧门把手，门开了。房间里一团糟。所有的提包都开着，衣服扔得到处都是。床边有几个空酒瓶。迈克躺在床上，脸庞活象他死后翻制的石膏面型。他张开眼睛看着我。\\n\\n “你好，杰克，”他慢条斯理地说。“我想打个——个——盹儿，好长时间了，我总想——想——睡一小——小——会儿觉。”\\n\\n “我给你盖上被子吧。”\\n\\n “不用。我不冷。\\n\\n “你别走。我还没——没——睡——睡着过呢，”他又说。\\n\\n “你会睡着的，迈克。别担心，老弟。”\\n\\n “勃莱特搞上了一个斗牛士，”迈克说。“可是她那个犹太人倒是走了。”\\n\\n 他转过头来看着我。\\n\\n “天大的好事，对吧？”“是的。现在你快睡吧，迈克。你该睡点觉了。”\\n\\n “我这——这——就睡。我要——要——睡一小——小——会儿觉。”\\n\\n 他闭上眼睛。我走出房间，轻轻地带上门。比尔在我房间里看报。\\n\\n “看见迈克啦？”\\n\\n “是的。”\\n\\n “我们吃饭去吧。”\\n\\n “这里有个德国侍者总管，我不愿意在楼下吃。我领迈克上楼的时候，他讨厌透了。”\\n\\n “他对我们也是这样。”\\n\\n “我们出去到大街上吃去。”\\n\\n 我们下楼。在楼梯上我们和一名上楼的侍女擦肩而过，她端了一个蒙着餐巾的托盘。\\n\\n “那是给勃莱特吃的饭，”比尔说。\\n\\n “还有那位小伙的，”我说。\\n\\n 门外拱廊下的露台上，德国侍者总管走过来。他那红扑扑的两颊亮光光的。他很客气。\\n\\n “我给你们两位先生留了一张双人桌，”他说。\\n\\n “你自己去坐吧，”比尔说。我们一直走出去，跨过马路。\\n\\n 我们在广场边一条小巷里一家餐厅吃饭。这餐厅里的吃客都是男的。屋里烟雾弥漫，人们都在喝酒唱歌。饭菜很好，酒也好。我们很少说话。后来我们到咖啡馆去观看狂欢活动达到沸腾的高潮。勃莱特吃完饭马上就来了。她说她曾到迈克的房间里看了一下，他睡着了。\\n\\n 当狂欢活动达到沸腾的高潮并转移到斗牛场的时候，我们随同人群到了那里。勃莱特坐在第一排我和比尔之间。看台和场子四周那道红色栅栏之间有一条狭窄的通道，就在我们的下面。我们背后的混凝土看台已经坐得满满的了。前边，红色栅栏外面是铺着黄澄澄的砂子、碾得平展展的场地。雨后的场地看来有点泞，但是经太阳一晒就干了，又坚实、又平整。随从和斗牛场的工役走下通道，肩上扛着装有斗牛用的斗篷和红巾的柳条篮。沾有血迹的斗篷和红巾叠得板板整整地安放在柳条篮里。随从们打开笨重的皮剑鞘，把剑鞘靠在栅栏上，露出一束裹着红布的剑柄。他们抖开一块块有紫黑血迹的红色法兰绒，套上短棍，把它张开，并且让斗牛士可以握住了挥舞。勃莱特仔细看着这一切。她被这一行玩艺的细枝末节吸引住了。\\n\\n “他的每件斗篷和每块红巾上都印着他的名字，”她说。“为什么管这些红色法兰绒叫做muleta呢？”\\n\\n “我不知道。”\\n\\n “不知道这些东西到底有没有洗过。”\\n\\n “我看是从来不洗的。一洗可能要掉色。”\\n\\n “血迹会使法兰绒发硬，”比尔说。\\n\\n “真奇怪，”勃莱特说。“人们竟能对血迹一点不在意。”\\n\\n 在下面狭窄的通道上，随从们安排着上场前的一切准备工作。所有的座位都坐满了人。看台上方，所有的包厢也满了、除了主席的包厢外，已经没有一个空座。等主席一入场，斗牛就要开始。在场子里平整的沙地对面，斗牛士们站在通牛栏的高大的门洞子里聊天，他们把胳臂裹在斗篷里，等待列队入场的信号。勃莱特拿着望远镜看他们。\\n\\n “给，你想看看吗？”\\n\\n 我从望远镜里看出去，看到那三位斗牛士。罗梅罗居中，左边是贝尔蒙蒂，右边是马西亚尔。他们背后是他们的助手，而在短枪手的后面，我看到在后边通道和牛栏里的空地上站着长矛手。罗梅罗穿一套黑色斗牛服。他的三角帽低扣在眼睛上。我看不清他帽子下面的脸，但是看来伤痕不少。他的两眼笔直地望着前方。马西亚尔把香烟藏在手心里，小心翼翼地抽着。贝尔蒙蒂朝前望着，面孔黄得毫无血色，长长的狼下巴向外撅着。他目光茫然，视而不见。无论是他还是罗梅罗，看来和别人都毫无共同之处。他们孑然伫立。主席入场了；我们上面的大看台上传来鼓掌声，我就把望远镜递给勃莱特。一阵鼓掌。开始奏乐。勃莱特拿着望远镜看。\\n\\n “给，拿去，”她说。\\n\\n 在望远镜里，我看见贝尔蒙蒂在跟罗梅罗说话。马西亚尔直直身子，扔掉香烟，于是这三位斗牛士双目直视着前方，昂着头，摆着一只空手入场了。他们后面跟随着整个队列，进了场向两边展开，全体正步走，每个人都一只手拿着卷起的斗篷，摆动着另一只空手。接着出场的是举着长矛，象带枪骑兵般的长矛手。最后压阵的是两行骡子和斗牛场的工役。斗牛士们一手按住头上的帽子，在主席的包厢前弯腰鞠躬，然后向我们下面的栅栏走来。佩德罗.罗梅罗脱下他那件沉甸甸的金线织锦斗篷，递给他在栅栏这一边的随从。他对随从说了几句话。这时罗梅罗就在我们下面不远的地方，我们看见他嘴唇肿起、两眼充血、脸庞青肿。随从接过斗篷，抬头看看勃莱特，便走到我们跟前，把斗篷递上来。\\n\\n “把它摊开，放在你的前面，”我说。\\n\\n 勃莱特屈身向前。斗篷用金线绣制，沉重而挺括。随从回头看看，摇摇头，说了些什么。坐在我旁边的一个男人向勃莱特侧过身子。\\n\\n “他不要你把斗篷摊开，”他说。“你把它折好，放在膝上。”\\n\\n 勃莱特折起沉重的斗篷。\\n\\n 罗梅罗没有抬头望我们。他正和贝尔蒙蒂说话。贝尔蒙蒂已经把他的礼服斗篷给他的朋友们送去了。他朝他们望去，笑笑，他笑起来也象狼，只是张张嘴，脸上没有笑意。罗梅罗趴在栅栏上要水罐。随从拿来水罐，罗梅罗往斗牛用的斗篷的细布里子上倒水，然后用穿平跟鞋的脚在沙地上蹭斗篷的下摆。\\n\\n “那是干什么？”勃莱特问。\\n\\n “加点儿分量；不让风吹得飘起来。”\\n\\n “他脸色很不好，”比尔说。\\n\\n “他自我感觉也非常不好，”勃莱特说。“他应该卧床休息。”\\n\\n 第一头牛由贝尔蒙蒂来对付。贝尔蒙蒂技艺高超。但是因为他一场有三万比塞塔收入，加上人们排了整整一夜队来买票看他表演，所以观众要求他该表现得特别突出。贝尔蒙蒂最吸引人的地方是和牛靠得很近。在斗牛中有所谓公牛地带和斗牛士地带之说。斗牛士只要处在自己的地带里，就比较安全。每当他进入公牛地带，他就处于极大的危险之中。在贝尔蒙蒂的黄金时期，他总是在公牛地带表演。这样，他就给人一种即将发生悲剧的感觉。人们去看斗牛是为了去看贝尔蒙蒂，为了去领受悲剧性的激情，或许是为了去看贝尔蒙蒂之死。十五年前人们说，如果你想看贝尔蒙蒂，那你得在他还活着的时候趁早去。打那时候起，他已经杀死了一千多头牛。他退隐之后，传奇性的流言四起，说他的斗牛如何如何奇妙，他后来重返斗牛场，公众大失所望，因为没有一个凡人能象据说贝尔蒙蒂曾经做到的那样靠近公牛，当然啦，即使贝尔蒙蒂本人也做不到。\\n\\n 此外，贝尔蒙蒂提出了种种条件，坚决要求牛的个头不能太大，牛角长得不要有太大的危险性，因而，引起即将发生悲剧的感觉所必需的因素消失了，而观众呢，却要求长了瘘管的贝尔蒙蒂做到他过去所能够做到的三倍，现在不免感到上了当，于是贝尔蒙蒂的下巴由于屈辱而撅得更出，脸色变得更黄，由于疼痛加剧，行动更是艰难，最后观众干脆以行动来反对他，他呢，完全采取鄙视和冷淡的态度。他原以为今天是他的好日于，迎来的却是一下午的嘲笑和高声的辱骂，最后，坐垫、面包片和瓜菜一齐飞向当年他曾在这里取得莫大胜利的场地，落在他的身上。他只是把下巴撅得更出一点。有时候，观众的叫骂特别不堪入耳，他会拉长下巴，龇牙咧嘴地一笑，而每个动作所给他的痛苦变得愈来愈剧烈，到最后，他那发黄的脸变成了羊皮纸的颜色。等他杀死了第二头牛，面包和坐垫也扔完了，他撅出狼下巴带着惯常的笑容和鄙视的目光向主席致礼，把他的剑递到栅栏后面，让人擦干净后放回剑鞘，他这才走进通道，倚在我们座位下面的栅栏上，把脑袋俯在胳臂上，什么也不看，什么也不听，只顾忍受痛苦的折磨。最后他抬头要了点水。他咽了几口，漱漱嘴，吐掉，拿起斗篷，回进斗牛场。\\n\\n 观众因反对贝尔蒙蒂，所以就向着罗梅罗。他一离开看台前的栅栏向牛走去，观众就向他鼓起掌来。贝尔蒙蒂也在看他，装作不看，其实一直在看。他没有把马西亚尔放在心上。马西亚尔的底细他了如指掌。他重返斗牛场的目的是和马西亚尔一比高低，以为这是一场胜利早已在握的比赛。他期望同马西亚尔以及其它衰落时期的斗牛明星比一比，他知道只要他在斗牛场上一亮相，衰落时期的斗牛士那套虚张声势的技艺就会在他扎实的斗牛功底面前黯然失色。他这次退隐后重返斗牛场被罗梅罗破坏了。罗梅罗总是那么自如、稳健、优美。他，贝尔蒙蒂，如今只偶尔才能使自己做到这一点。观众感觉到了，甚至从比亚里茨来的人也感觉到了，最后连美国\\n\\n
