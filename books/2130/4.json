{"id":94418,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Some time later, Drizzt was beginning to worry. Robillard had already left the Mermaid\u0027s Arms, disgusted that his captain, as he had put it, \"couldn\u0027t be counted on.\" Waillan Micanty was still at the bar beside Drizzt, though the young man had taken up a conversation with another sailor on the other side of him. Drizzt, his back to the bar, continued to survey the crowd, perfectly at ease among the sailors. It hadn\u0027t always been so. Drizzt had come through Waterdeep only twice before he and Catti-brie had left Mithril Hall, first on his way to Calimport chasing Entreri, and on the return trip, when he and his friends were making their way back to reclaim Mithril Hall. Drizzt had made that first passage through the city in disguise, using a magical mask to appear as a surface elf. The second journey through, made without the mask, had been a trickier proposition. The Sea Sprite had put into Waterdeep Harbor in early morning but, at Deudermont\u0027s request, Drizzt and his friends had waited until after dark to leave the city for the road to the east. Upon his return to Waterdeep with Catti-brie six years ago, Drizzt had dared to walk openly as a drow. It had been an uncomfortable experience, eyes were upon him every step, and more than one ruffian had challenged him. Drizzt had avoided those challenges, but knew that sooner or later, he would have to fight, or even worse, he would be slain from afar, likely by a hidden bowman, for no better reason than the color of the skin. Then the Sea Sprite had put in and Drizzt had found Deudermont, his old friend and a man of considerable reputation among the docks of the great city. Soon after, Drizzt had become widely accepted in Waterdeep, particularly all along Dock Street, because of his personal reputation, spread in no small way by Captain Deudermont. Wherever the Sea Sprite docked, it was made clear that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, this most unusual of dark elves, was a member of her heroic crew. Drizzt\u0027s road had been easier, had even become comfortable. And through it all, Catti-brie and Guenhwyvar had been beside him. He looked to them now, the young woman sitting at a table with two of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, the great panther curled up on the floor about her legs. Guenhwyvar had become a mascot to the patrons of the Mermaid\u0027s Arms, and Drizzt was glad that he could sometimes call in the cat, not for battle, but simply for companionship. Drizzt wondered which reason would hold this day. Catti-brie had requested the panther, saying her feet were cold, and Drizzt had agreed, but in the back of the drow\u0027s mind was the realization that Deudermont might be in trouble. Guenhwyvar might be needed for more than companionship. The drow surely relaxed a moment later, blew out a deep sigh of relief as Captain Deudermont walked into the Mermaid\u0027s Arms, glanced around, then focused on Drizzt and sidled up to the bar. \"Calimshan wine,\" the doppleganger said to the bartender, for it had scoured Deudermont\u0027s mind and knew that to be the man\u0027s customary drink. In the short time they had spent together, the doppleganger had learned much of Captain Deudermont and of the Sea Sprite. Drizzt turned about and leaned over the bar. \"You are late,\" he remarked, trying to feel the captain out, trying to discern if there had been any trouble. \"A minor problem,\" the impostor assured him. \"What is it, Guen?\" Catti-brie asked softly as the panther\u0027s head came up, the cat looking in the direction of Drizzt and Deudermont, her ears flattened against her head and a low growl resonating from her strong body. \"What do ye see?\" Guenhwyvar continued to watch the pair closely, but Catti-brie dismissed the cat\u0027s temperament, figuring there must be a rat or the like in the far corner beyond Drizzt and the captain. \"Caerwich,\" the impostor announced to Drizzt. The ranger regarded the man curiously. \"Caerwich?\" he echoed. Drizzt knew the name; every sailor along the Sword Coast knew the name of the tiny island, which was too small and remote to appear on the vast majority of nautical charts. \"We must put out at once for Caerwich,\" the impostor explained, looking Drizzt directly in the eye. So perfect was the disguise of the doppleganger that Drizzt hadn\u0027t the slightest idea that anything was amiss. Still, the request sounded strange to Drizzt. Caerwich was a shipboard story, a tale of a haunted island that played home to a blind witch. Many doubted its existence, though some sailors claimed to have visited the place. Certainly Drizzt and Deudermont had never spoken of it. For the captain to announce that they must go there caught the drow completely by surprise. Again Drizzt studied Deudermont, this time noting the man\u0027s stiff mannerisms, noting how uncomfortable Deudermont seemed in this place, which had always been his favorite among the taverns of Dock Street. Drizzt believed something had unnerved Deudermont. Whatever had delayed his arrival at the Mermaid\u0027s Arms-Drizzt figured it to be a visit by one of Waterdeep\u0027s secretive lords, perhaps even mysterious Khelben-had upset Deudermont greatly. Perhaps Deudermont\u0027s announcement wasn\u0027t so out of place. Many times in the last six years, the Sea Sprite, the tool of Waterdeep\u0027s Lords, had been assigned private, unusual missions, and so the drow accepted the information without question. What both Drizzt and the doppleganger hadn\u0027t counted on was Guenhwyvar, who crouched so low that her belly brushed against the floor as she inched for Deudermont\u0027s back, her ears flat. \"Guenhwyvar!\" Drizzt scolded. The doppleganger spun about, putting its back to the wooden bar just as Guenhwyvar charged in, coming up high and pinning the creature to the bar. Had the doppleganger kept its wits and played the innocent victim, it might have talked its way out of the predicament. But the creature recognized Guenhwyvar, or at least the fact that this panther was not of the Prime Material Plane. And if the doppleganger instinctively recognized that about the panther, it figured the panther would recognize the same. Purely on instinct, the creature batted Guenhwyvar with its forearm, the weight of the blow launching the six-hundred pound cat halfway across the wide room. No human could do that, and when the impostor looked again at Drizzt, it found that the drow had his scimitars in hand. \"Who are you?\" Drizzt demanded. The creature hissed and grabbed at the blades, catching one. Drizzt struck, tentatively and with the flat of his free blade, for he feared that this might be Deudermont under some type of enchantment. He smacked the impostor on the side of the neck. The creature caught the blade in its open hand, and it rushed forward and bowled Drizzt aside. The rest of those in the tavern were up then, most thinking it one of the typical fights. But the crew of the Sea Sprite, particularly Catti-brie, realized the absolute strangeness of the scene. The doppleganger made for the door, slapping aside the one confused sailor, one of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crewmen, who stood in its way. Catti-brie had her bow ready, and she put an arrow, trailing silvery sparks, into the wall right beside the creature\u0027s head. The doppleganger spun to face her, hissed loudly, and was subsequently buried by six hundred pounds of flying panther. This time Guenhwyvar recognized the strength of her foe and by the time the two had sorted out their tumble, the great cat was sitting on the doppleganger\u0027s back, her powerful jaws clamped tight on the nape of the thing\u0027s neck. Drizzt was there in an instant, followed closely by Catti-brie, Waillan Micanty and the rest of the crew, and more than a few curious onlookers, including the proprietor of the Mermaid\u0027s Arms, who wanted to get a look at the damage from that enchanted arrow. \"What are you?\" Drizzt demanded, grabbing the impostor by the hair and turning its head so that he could look into its face. Drizzt rubbed his free hand across the thing\u0027s cheek, looking for makeup, but found none. He barely got his fingers away before the doppleganger bit at them. Guenhwyvar growled and tightened her jaws, forcing the creature\u0027s face to slam hard back into the floor. \"Go and check out Dock Street!\" Drizzt called to Waillan. \"Near to where you last saw the captain!\" \"But ...\" Waillan protested, pointing to the prone form. \"This is not Captain Deudermont,\" Drizzt assured him. \"This is not even human!\" Waillan motioned to several of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crew and headed out, followed by many other sailors who called themselves friends of the apparently missing captain. \"And call for the Watch!\" Drizzt yelled after them, referring to the famed Waterdeep patrols. \"Be ready with your bow,\" Drizzt said to Catti-brie and she nodded and fitted another arrow to the bowstring. Working with Guenhwyvar, the drow managed to get the doppleganger fully subdued and standing against a wall. The bartender offered some heavy rope, and they tightly bound the doppleganger\u0027s hands behind its back. \"I ask you one more time,\" Drizzt began threateningly. The creature merely spat in his face and began laughing, a diabolical sound indeed. The drow did not respond with force, just stared hard at this impostor. Truly Drizzt\u0027s heart was low then, for the way the impostor looked at him, laughed at him, only at him, sent a shiver along his spine. He wasn\u0027t afraid for his own safety, never that, but he feared that his past had caught up with him once again, that the evil powers of Menzoberranzan had found him here in Waterdeep, and that the good Captain Deudermont had fallen because of him. If true, it was more than Drizzt Do\u0027Urden could bear. \"I offer your life in exchange for Captain Deudermont,\" the drow said. \"It\u0027s not your place to be bargaining with the . . . whatever it might be,\" remarked one sailor whom Drizzt did not know. The drow, scowling fiercely, turned to face the man, who went silent and backed away, having no desire to invoke the wrath of a dark elf, especially one of Drizzt\u0027s fighting reputation. \"Your life for Deudermont,\" Drizzt said again to the doppleganger. Again came that diabolical laughter and the creature spat in Drizzt\u0027s face. Left, right, left came Drizzt\u0027s open palms in rapid succession, battering the creature\u0027s face. The last punch bent the thing\u0027s nose, but it reformed, right before Drizzt\u0027s eyes, to perfectly resemble the unmarred nose of Captain Deudermont. That image, combined with the continuing laughter, sent ripples of rage through the drow and he slugged the impostor with all his strength. Catti-brie wrapped her arms about Drizzt and pulled him away, though the mere sight of her reminded Drizzt of who he was and shamed him for his rash, out-of-control actions. \"Where is he?\" Drizzt demanded, and when the creature continued to taunt him, Guenhwyvar came up on her hind legs, resting one forepaw on each shoulder, and putting her snarling visage barely an inch from the doppleganger\u0027s face. That quieted the creature, for it knew that Guenhwyvar recognized the truth of its existence, and knew that the angry panther could utterly destroy it. \"Get a wizard,\" one sailor offered suddenly. \"Robillard!\" exclaimed another, the last of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, besides Drizzt and Catti-brie, in the tavern. \"He\u0027ll know how to get the information out of this thing.\" \"Go,\" Catti-brie agreed, and the man rushed out. \"A priest,\" offered another man. \"A priest will better deal with ...\" The man paused, not knowing what to make of this impostor. Through it all, the doppleganger remained passive, matching Guenhwyvar\u0027s stare but making no threatening moves. The crewman had barely exited the tavern when he was passed by another of the Sea Sprite\u0027s hands, heading back in with the news that Deudermont had been found. Out they went, Drizzt shoving the doppleganger along, Guenhwyvar on the other side of the creature and Catti-brie behind it, her bow up and ready, an arrow tip nearly touching the back of the thing\u0027s head. They came into the alley even as the sewer grate was being pried open, one sailor promptly dropping into the smelly hole to help his captain out. Deudermont eyed the doppleganger, eyed the perfect image of himself, with open contempt. \"You may as well assume your natural form,\" he said to the thing. Drawing himself up straight, he brushed off some of the muck, regaining his dignity in an instant. \"They know who I am, and know what you are.\" The doppleganger did nothing. Drizzt kept Twinkle tight against the side of its neck, Guenhwyvar remained alert on the other side, and Catti-brie went over to Deudermont, supporting the injured man. \"Might I lean on your bow?\" the captain asked, and Catti-brie, with hardly a thought, quickly handed it over. \"Must be a wizard,\" Deudermont said to Drizzt, though the captain suspected differently. The injured Deudermont took the offered bow and leaned on it heavily. \"If he utters a single, uncalled for syllable, slash his throat,\" he instructed. Drizzt nodded and pressed Twinkle a bit closer. Catti-brie moved to take Deudermont\u0027s arm, but he waved her ahead, then followed closely. Far away, on a smoky layer of the Abyss, Errtu watched the unfolding scene with pure delight. The trap had been set, not as the great tanar\u0027ri had expected when he had sent the doppleganger to Waterdeep, but set anyway, and perhaps more deliciously, more unexpectedly, more chaotically. Errtu understood Drizzt Do\u0027Urden well enough to know that the mention of Caerwich was all the bait that was needed. Something awful had happened to them that night and they would not let it pass, would go willingly to the mentioned island and discover the source. The mighty fiend was having more fun than he had known in years. Errtu could have delivered the message to Drizzt more easily, but this intrigue-the doppleganger, the blind witch who waited at Caerwich-was the fun of it all. The only thing that would be more fun for Errtu was tearing Drizzt Do\u0027Urden apart, little piece by little piece, devouring his flesh before his very eyes. The balor howled at that thought, figuring that it would soon enough come to pass. Deudermont straightened as much as possible and continued to wave away any offered help. The captain put on a good face, and stayed close behind Catti-brie as she moved slowly toward the alley exit, toward Drizzt and Guenhwyvar and the captured doppleganger. Deudermont watched that strange creature most carefully of all. He understood the evil of the thing, had felt it up close. Deudermont hated the thing for the beating it had given him, but in assuming the captain\u0027s form, the thing had violated him in a way that he could not tolerate. Looking at the creature now, as it wore the features of the Sea Sprite\u0027s Captain, Deudermont could barely keep his anger in check. He kept very close to Catti-brie, watching, anticipating. Near to Dock Street, Drizzt stood quietly beside the bound impostor. The drow and the many crewmen nearby were focused on the injured captain, and none of them noticed as the creature began to shift its malleable form once more, reshaping its arms so that they slipped and twisted free of the bonds. Drizzt just got his second scimitar out after the creature suddenly shoved him aside. The doppleganger bolted for the alley\u0027s exit with Guenhwyvar close behind. Wings sprouted from the doppleganger\u0027s back and it leaped high, meaning to fly off into the night. Guenhwyvar charged and sprang mightily in pursuit while Captain Deudermont slipped an arrow from the quiver on Catti-brie\u0027s hip. The woman, sensing the theft, spun about as the bow came up. She cried out, fell to the side and Deudermont let fly. The doppleganger was more than twenty feet off the ground by the time Guenhwyvar began her leap, but still the great panther caught up to the flying monster, her jaws catching a firm hold on the creature\u0027s ankle. That limb shifted and reformed immediately, making the panther\u0027s grasp tentative. Then came the silver-streaking arrow, slamming the doppleganger square in the back, right between the wings. Down came Guenhwyvar, landing lightly on padded paws, and down came the doppleganger, dead before it ever hit the ground. Drizzt was there in an instant, the others rushing to catch up with him. The creature began to shift its form again. Its newest features melted away, to be replaced by a humanoid appearance the likes of which none of the gathering had ever seen. Its skin was perfectly smooth, the fingers of its slender hand showing no distin- guishable grooves. It was completely hairless, and everything about it seemed perfectly unremarkable. It was a lump of humanoid-shaped clay and nothing more. \"Doppleganger,\" Deudermont remarked. \"It would seem that Pinochet is not pleased by our latest exploits.\" Drizzt nodded, allowing himself to agree with the captain\u0027s reasoning. This incident wasn\u0027t about him, wasn\u0027t about who he was and where he came from. He had to believe that. Errtu thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle, and was glad that he would not have to pay off his hired master of disguise. It bothered the fiend for a moment that his guide for the Sea Sprite\u0027s voyage to the virtually unchartered island had just gone away, but the balor held his faith. The seeds had been sown; the doppleganger had teased Deudermont about the destination, and Drizzt had heard the exact name of the island and would pass it on to the captain. The balor knew neither were cowards, both were resourceful and curious. Errtu knew Drizzt and Deudermont would find their way to Caerwich and the blind seer who held the fiend\u0027s message. Soon enough.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passage-to-dawn-legacy-of-the-drow-4/page-4.html","bookId":2130,"book":{"id":2130,"title":"Passage to Dawn (Legacy of the Drow #4)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #4: Passage to Dawn Revenge and Resurrection in a Frozen Wasteland!
