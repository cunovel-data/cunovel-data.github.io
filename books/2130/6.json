{"id":94420,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Wrapped in a blanket, his robes hanging on the mast high above him to dry in the wind, the waterlogged wizard sneezed repeatedly, spraying those around him. He simply couldn\u0027t contain himself and got Deudermont right in the face when the captain came up for an introduction.\\n\\n \"I give to you one Harkle Harpell of Longsaddle,\" Drizzt said to Deudermont. Harkle extended his hand, and the blanket fell away from him. The skinny wizard scrambled to retrieve it, but was too late.\\n\\n \"Get this one a meal,\" Catti-brie snickered from behind. \"Suren he could use a bit o\u0027meat on that bum.\"\\n\\n Harkle blushed a deep red. Robillard, who had already met the Harpell, just walked away, shaking his head and suspecting that exciting times were yet to come.\\n\\n \"What brings you here,\" Deudermont asked, \"so far from shore, on the open seas?\"\\n\\n Harkle looked to Drizzt. \"I came on invitation,\" he said at length, seeming somewhat perturbed when the drow made no move to answer for him.\\n\\n Drizzt eyed him curiously.\\n\\n \"I did!\" protested the wizard. \"On your word.\" He spun about to regard Catti-brie. \"And yours!\"\\n\\n Catti-brie looked to Drizzt, who shrugged and held his hands out to the sides, having no idea of what Harkle might be talking about.\\n\\n \"Oh, well, well, well, a fine \u0027hello,\u0027 I suppose,\" the exasperated wizard stammered. \"But then, I expected it, though I hoped a drow elf would have a longer memory. What do you say to someone you meet again after a century? Couldn\u0027t remember his name, could you? Oh, no, no. That would be too much trouble.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" Drizzt had to ask. \"I remember your name.\"\\n\\n \"And a good thing, too!\" Harkle roared. \"Or I would really be mad!\" He snapped his fingers indignantly in the air, and the sound sobered him. He stood for a long moment, seeming thoroughly confused, as though he had forgotten what in the world he was talking about.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" Harkle said at length and looked straight at Drizzt. The wizard\u0027s stern expression soon softened to one of curiosity.\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" Drizzt asked again, trying to prompt Harkle.\\n\\n \"I do not know,\" the wizard admitted.\\n\\n \"You were telling me what brought you out here,\" Deudermont put in.\\n\\n Harkle snapped his fingers again. \"The spell, of course!\" he said happily.\\n\\n Deudermont sighed. \"Obviously, it was a spell,\" the captain began slowly, trying to find a path that would garner some useful information from the rambling mage.\\n\\n \"Not \u0027a\u0027 spell,\" Harkle retorted. \"The spell. My new spell, the fog of fate.\"\\n\\n \"The fog of fate?\" Deudermont echoed.\\n\\n \"Oh, very good spell,\" Harkle began excitedly. \"Expedites things, you know. Get on with your life and all that. Shows you where to go. Puts you there even, I think. But it doesn\u0027t tell you why.\" The wizard moved one hand up to tap at his chin, and his blanket slipped down again, but he didn\u0027t seem to notice. \"I should work on that part. Yes, yes, then I would know why I was here.\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re not even knowin\u0027?\" Catti-brie asked, and she faced the rail, even leaned over it somewhat, so she wouldn\u0027t have to look at Harkle\u0027s bony buttocks.\\n\\n \"Answering an invitation, I suppose,\" Harkle replied.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s expression was purely doubtful, as was Drizzt\u0027s.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true!\" Harkle protested vehemently. \"Oh, so convenient of you to forget. Shouldn\u0027t say things you don\u0027t mean, I say! When you, both of you\"-he looked from one to the other, waggling his finger-\"passed through Longsaddle six years ago, you mentioned that you hoped our paths might cross once more. \u0027If ever you find yourself near to us.\u0027 That is exactly what you said!\"\\n\\n \"I do not-\" Drizzt began, but Harkle waved him silent, then rushed to the oversized pack he had carried with him, which was drying on the deck. His blanket slipped down farther, but the wizard was too consumed by his task to notice. Catti-brie didn\u0027t bother to look away, she just snickered and shook her head.\\n\\n Harkle pulled a small flask from his pack, retrieved his blanket for modesty\u0027s sake, and bounced back over to stand before Drizzt. Snapping his fingers defiantly in the air before the drow, the wizard popped off the cork.\\n\\n From the flask came a voice, Catti-brie\u0027s own voice. \"If you ever find yerself near to us,\" she said, \"do look in.\"\\n\\n \"So there,\" Harkle said in superior tones as he plopped the cork back into place. He stood for a long moment, hands on hips, until Drizzt\u0027s smile became inviting. \"And just where are we?\" the wizard asked, turning to Deudermont.\\n\\n The captain looked to the drow ranger, and Drizzt could offer only a shrug in reply. \"Come, and I will show you,\" Deudermont said, leading the wizard toward his cabin. \"And I will get you some proper clothes to wear until your robes have dried.\"\\n\\n When the two were gone, Catti-brie, walked back over to her friend. Robillard stood not so far away, glaring at them both.\\n\\n \"Pray we find no more pirates to fight until we can be rid of our cargo,\" the wizard said.\\n\\n \"Harkle will try to help,\" Catti-brie replied.\\n\\n \"Pray hard,\" Robillard muttered and walked away.\\n\\n \"You should be more careful of what you say,\" Drizzt remarked to Catti-brie.\\n\\n \"Could have been yer own voice just as well as me own,\" the young woman shot back. \"And besides, Harkle did try to help in the fight.\"\\n\\n \"It could as easily have been us he engulfed, in stream or in fire,\" Drizzt promptly reminded her.\\n\\n Catti-brie sighed and had no words to reply. They turned to the door of Deudermont\u0027s cabin, where the captain stood with Harkle, about to enter.\\n\\n \"So that was the fog of fate you cast at our pirate friends, eh?\" Deudermont asked, trying to sound impressed.\\n\\n \"Huh?\" Harkle answered. \"That? Oh, no, no, that was a fireball. I am good at casting those!\" The Harpell paused and lowered his eyes, following Deudermont inside. \"Except that I aimed too low,\" Harkle admitted quietly.\\n\\n Catti-brie and Drizzt looked to each other, then to Robillard. \"Pray,\" all three whispered in unison.\\n\\n Drizzt and Catti-brie dined privately with Deudermont that night, the captain seeming more animated than he had since they had put out from Waterdeep. The two friends tried to apologize for Harkle\u0027s arrival several times, but Deudermont brushed such thoughts away, even hinted that he was not so upset about the Harpell\u0027s arrival.\\n\\n Finally Deudermont sat back in his chair, wiped his neatly-groomed goatee with a satin napkin and stared hard at the two friends, who fell silent, understanding that the captain had something important to tell them.\\n\\n \"We are not in this area by chance,\" Deudermont admitted bluntly.\\n\\n \"And not going to Baldur\u0027s Gate,\" reasoned Drizzt, who had suspected all along. The Sea Sprite was supposedly running to Baldur\u0027s Gate, but Deudermont hadn\u0027t been careful about staying close to the coast, the more direct route, the safer route, and the route most likely to allow them to find and capture pirates.\\n\\n Again there ensued a long pause, as though the captain had to settle things in his own mind before admitting them openly. \"We\u0027re turning west for Mintarn,\" Deudermont said.\\n\\n Catti-brie\u0027s jaw dropped open.\\n\\n \"A free port,\" Drizzt reminded, and warned. The island of Mintarn had a well-earned reputation as a haven for pirates and other fugitives, a rough and tumble place. How might the Sea Sprite, the hunter of justice, be received in such a port?\\n\\n \"A free port,\" Deudermont agreed. \"Free for pirates and free for the Sea Sprite, in need of information.\"\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t openly question the captain, but his doubting expression spoke volumes.\\n\\n \"The Lords of Waterdeep have given the Sea Sprite over to me completely,\" Deudermont said, somewhat harshly. \"She\u0027s my ship, under my word alone. I can take her to Mintarn, to the Moonshaes, all the way to Ruathym, if I so please, and let no one question me!\"\\n\\n Drizzt sat back in his seat, stung by the harsh words and surprised that Deudermont, who had professed to be his friend, had so treated him as a subordinate.\\n\\n The captain winced openly at the sight of the drow\u0027s disappointment. \"My pardon,\" he said quietly.\\n\\n Drizzt came forward in his seat, leaning his elbows on the table to bring himself closer to Deudermont. \"Caerwich?\" he asked.\\n\\n Deudermont eyed him directly. \"The doppleganger spoke of Caerwich, and so to Caerwich I must go.\"\\n\\n \"And do ye not think ye\u0027ll be sailing right into a trap?\" Catti-brie put in. \"Going right where they\u0027re wanting ye to go?\"\\n\\n \"Who?\" Deudermont asked.\\n\\n \"Whoever sent the doppleganger,\" Catti-brie reasoned.\\n\\n \"Who?\" Deudermont asked again.\\n\\n Catti-brie shrugged. \"Pinochet?\" she queried. \"Or mighten it be some other pirate that\u0027s had his fill o\u0027 the Sea Sprite?\"\\n\\n Deudermont leaned back in his seat again, as did Drizzt, all three sitting in silence for several long moments. \"I cannot, nor do I believe that you can, continue to sail up and down the Sword Coast as though nothing at all has happened,\" the captain explained. Drizzt closed his lavender eyes, expecting this answer and agreeing with the logic. \"Someone powerful, for doppleganger hirelings are neither common nor cheap, desires my demise and the end of the Sea Sprite, and I intend to find out who it might be. I\u0027ve never run from a fight, nor has my crew, and any who are not prepared to go to Caerwich may disembark in Mintarn and catch a sail back to Waterdeep, paid by my own coffers.\"\\n\\n \"Not a one will go,\" Catti-brie admitted.\\n\\n \"Yet we do not even know if Caerwich truly exists,\" Drizzt remarked. \"Many claim to have been there, but these are the tales of seagoing men, tales too often exaggerated by drink or by bluster.\"\\n\\n \"So we must find out,\" Deudermont said with a tone of finality. Neither Drizzt nor Catti-brie, both willing to face trouble head-on, offered a word of disagreement. \"Perhaps it is not such a bad thing that your wizard friend arrived,\" the captain went on. \"Another wizard knowledgeable in the mystical arts might help us to sort through this mystery.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie and Drizzt exchanged doubtful looks; Captain Deudermont obviously didn\u0027t know Harkle Harpell! They said no more about it, though, and finished the meal discussing more pertinent matters of the everyday handling of the ship and crew. Deudermont wanted to go to Mintarn, so Drizzt and Catti-brie would follow.\\n\\n After the meal, the two friends strolled out onto the nearly-deserted deck of the schooner, walking under a canopy of brilliant stars.\\n\\n \"Ye were relieved at the captain\u0027s tale,\" Catti-brie remarked.\\n\\n After a moment of surprise, Drizzt nodded.\\n\\n \"Ye thought the attack in Waterdeep had to do with yerself, and not with Deudermont or the Sea Sprite,\" Catti-brie went on.\\n\\n The drow simply stood and listened, for, as usual, the perceptive young woman had hit his feelings exactly, had read him like an open book.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027ll always be fearing that every danger comes from yer home,\" Catti-brie said, moving to the rail and looking over at the reflection of the stars in the rolling waters.\\n\\n \"I have made many enemies,\" Drizzt replied as he joined her.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027ve left them buried in yer tracks,\" Catti-brie said with a laugh.\\n\\n Drizzt shared in that chuckle, and had to admit that she was right. This time, he believed, it wasn\u0027t about him. For several years now, he had been a player in the larger drama of the world. The personal element of the danger that had followed him every step since his initial departure from Menzoberranzan seemed a thing of the past. Now, under the stars and with Catti-brie beside him, thousands of miles and many years from Menzoberranzan, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden felt truly free, and carefree. He did not fear the trip to Mintarn, or to any mysterious island beyond that, whatever the rumors of haunts might be. Never did Drizzt Do\u0027Urden fear danger. He lived on the edge willingly, and if Deudermont was in trouble, then Drizzt was more than ready to take up his scimitars.\\n\\n As was Catti-brie, with her bow, Taulmaril, and the magnificent sword, Khazid\u0027hea, always ready at her hip. As was Guenhwyvar, ever-faithful companion. Drizzt did not fear danger; only guilt could bend his stoic shoulders. This time, it seemed, he carried no guilt, no responsibility for the attack and for the Sea Sprite\u0027s chosen course. He was a player in Deudermont\u0027s drama, a willing player.\\n\\n He and Catti-brie basked in the wind and the spray, watched the stars silently for hours. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passage-to-dawn-legacy-of-the-drow-4/page-6.html","bookId":2130,"book":{"id":2130,"title":"Passage to Dawn (Legacy of the Drow #4)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #4: Passage to Dawn \\n Revenge and Resurrection in a Frozen Wasteland!
