{"id":94421,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Kierstaad, son of Revjak, knelt on the soft turf, his knee pocking the ground. He was not tall by the standards of the Icewind Dale nomads, barely topping six feet, and was not as muscular as most. His hair was long and blond, his eyes the color of the sky on the brightest of days, and his smile, on those rare occasions that he displayed it, beamed from a warm soul.\n Across the flat tundra Kierstaad could see the snow-capped top of Kelvin\u0027s Cairn. It was the lone mountain in the thousand square miles of the land called Icewind Dale, the windswept strip of tundra between the Sea of Moving Ice and the northwestern spur of the Spine of the World mountains. If he were to move but a few miles toward the mountain, Kierstaad knew that he would see the tips of the masts of the fishing ships sailing Lac Dinneshere, second largest of the three lakes in the region.\n A few miles to a different world, Kierstaad realized. He was just a boy, really, having seen only seventeen winters. But in that time, Kierstaad had witnessed more of the Realms and of life than most in the world would ever know. He had traveled with\n many warriors to the call of Wulfgar, from Icewind Dale to a place called Settlestone, far, far away. He\u0027d celebrated his ninth birthday on the road, removed from his family. At the age of eleven, the young barbarian lad had battled goblins, kobolds, and drow elves, fighting beside Berkthgar the Bold, leader of Settle-stone. It was Berkthgar who had decided that the time had come for the barbarian peoples to return to Icewind Dale-their ancestral home-and the ways of their forebears.\n Kierstaad had seen so much, had lived two different lives, it seemed, in two different worlds. Now he was a nomad, a hunter out on the open tundra, approaching his eighteenth birthday and his first solitary hunt. Looking at Kelvin\u0027s Cairn, though, and knowing of the fishing ships on Lac Dinneshere, on Maer Dualdon to the west, and on Redwaters to the south, Kierstaad realized how narrow his existence had truly become, and how much wider was the world-a world just a few short miles from where he now knelt. He could picture the markets in Bryn Shander, the largest of the ten towns surrounding the lakes. He could imagine the multicolored garments, the jewels, the excitement, as the merchant caravans rolled in with the spring, the southerners bartering for the fine scrimshaw carved from the head bone of the three lakes\u0027 abundant knucklehead trout.\n Kierstaad\u0027s own garments were brown, like the tundra, like the reindeer he and his people hunted, like the tents they lived in.\n Still, the young man\u0027s sigh was not a lament for what was lost to him, but rather a resignation that this was now his way, the way of his ancestors. There was a simple beauty to it, Kierstaad had to admit, a toughness, too, that hardened the body and the soul. Kierstaad was a young man, but he was wise beyond his years. A family trait, so it was said, for Kierstaad\u0027s father, Revjak, had led the unified tribes after Wulfgar\u0027s departure. Calm and always in control, Revjak hadn\u0027t left Icewind Dale to go to war in Mithril Hall, explaining that he was too old and set in his ways. Revjak had stayed on with the majority of the barbarian people, solidifying the alliance between the nomadic tribes, and also strengthening the ties with the folk of Ten-Towns.\n Revjak hadn\u0027t been surprised, but was pleased at the return of Berkthgar, of Kierstaad-his youngest child-and of all the others. Still, with that return came many questions concerning the future of the nomadic tribes and the leadership of the barbarian people. \"More blood?\" came a question, drawing the young man from his contemplations. Kierstaad turned to see the other hunters, Berkthgar among them, moving up behind him.\n Kierstaad nodded and pointed to the red splotch on the brown ground. Berkthgar had speared a reindeer, a fine throw from a great distance, but only had wounded the beast, and it had taken flight. Always efficient, particularly when dealing with this animal that gave to them so very much, the hunters had rushed in pursuit. They would not wound an animal to let it die unclaimed. That was not their way. It was, according to Berkthgar, \"the wasting way of the men who lived in Ten-Towns, or who lived south of the Spine of the World.\"\n Berkthgar walked up beside the kneeling young man, the tall leader locking his own stare on distant Kelvin\u0027s Cairn. \"We must catch up to the beast soon,\" Berkthgar stated. \"If it gets too close to the valley, the dwarves will steal it.\"\n There were a few nods of agreement and the hunting party started off at a swift pace. Kierstaad lagged behind this time, his steps weighed by his leader\u0027s words. Ever since they had left Settlestone, Berkthgar had spoken ill of the dwarves, the folk who had been their friends and allies, Bruenor\u0027s folk, who had fought in a war of good cause beside the barbarians. What had happened to the cheers of victory? His most vivid memory of the short couple of years in Settlestone was not of the drow war, but of the celebration that had followed, a time of great fellowship between the dwarves, the curious svirfneblin, and the warriors who had joined in the cause from several of the surrounding villages.\n How had that all changed so dramatically? Barely a week on the road out of Settlestone, the story of the barbarian existence there had begun to change. The good times were no longer spoken of, replaced by tales of tragedy and hardship, of the barbarians lowering their spirits to menial tasks not fit for the Tribe of the Elk, or the Tribe of the Bear, or any of the ancestral tribes. Such talk had continued all the way around the Spine of the World, all the way back to Icewind Dale, and then, gradually, it had died away.\n Now, with rumors that the several score of the dwarves had returned to Icewind Dale, Berkthgar\u0027s critical remarks had begun anew. Kierstaad understood the source. The rumors said that Bruenor Battlehammer himself, the Eighth King of Mithril Hall, had returned. Shortly after the drow war, Bruenor had given the throne back over to his ancestor, Gandalug, Patron of Clan Battlehammer, who had returned from centuries of magical imprisonment at the hands of the drow elves. Even at the height of their alliance, relations between Berkthgar and Bruenor had been strained, for Bruenor had been the adoptive father of Wulfgar, the man who stood tallest in the barbarians\u0027 legends. Bruenor had forged mighty Aegis-fang, the warhammer which, in the hands of Wulfgar, had become the most honored weapon of all the tribes.\n But then, with Wulfgar gone, Bruenor would not give Aegis-fang over to Berkthgar.\n Even after his heroic exploits in the battle of Keeper\u0027s Dale against the drow, Berkthgar had remained in Wulfgar\u0027s shadow. It seemed to perceptive Kierstaad, that the leader had embarked on a campaign to discredit Wulfgar, to convince his proud people that Wulfgar was wrong, that Wulfgar was not a strong leader, that he was even a traitor to his people and their gods. Their old life, so said Berkthgar, one of roaming the tundra and living free of any bonds, was the better way.\n Kierstaad liked his life on the tundra, and wasn\u0027t certain that he disagreed with Berkthgar\u0027s observations concerning which was the more honorable lifestyle. But the young man had grown up admiring Wulfgar, and Berkthgar\u0027s words about the dead leader did not sit well with him.\n Kierstaad looked to Kelvin\u0027s Cairn as he ran along the soft, spongy ground, and wondered if the rumors were true. Had the dwarves returned, and if so, was King Bruenor with them?\n And if he was, could it be possible that he brought with him Aegis-fang, that most powerful of warhammers?\n Kierstaad felt a tingle at that thought, but it was lost a moment later when Berkthgar spotted the wounded reindeer and the hunt was on in full.\n \"Rope!\" Bruenor bellowed, hurling to the floor the twine the shopkeeper had offered him. \"Thick as me arm, ye durned orc-brain! Ye thinking that I\u0027m to hold up a tunnel with that?\"\n The flustered shopkeeper scooped up the twine and rambled away, grumbling with every step.\n Standing at Bruenor\u0027s left, Regis gave the dwarf a scowl.\n \"What?\" demanded the red-bearded dwarf, leaping to face the portly halfling directly. There weren\u0027t many people that the four-and-a-half foot dwarf could look down on, but Regis was one of them.\n Regis ran both his plump hands through his curly brown hair and chuckled. \"It is good that your coffers run deep,\" the halfling said, not afraid of blustery Bruenor in the least. \"Otherwise Maboyo would throw you out into the street.\"\n \"Bah!\" the dwarf snorted, straightening his lopsided, one-horned helmet as he turned away. \"He\u0027s needing the business. I got mines to reopen, and that\u0027s meaning gold for Maboyo.\"\n \"Good thing,\" Regis muttered.\n \"Keep flapping yer lips,\" Bruenor warned.\n Regis looked up curiously, his expression one of blank amazement.\n \"What?\" Bruenor insisted, turning to face him.\n \"You saw me,\" Regis breathed. \"And you just saw me again.\"\n Bruenor started to reply, but the words got caught in his throat. Regis was standing on Bruenor\u0027s left, and Bruenor had lost his left eye in a fight in Mithril Hall. After the war between Mithril Hall and Menzoberranzan, one of the most powerful priests of Silverymoon had cast healing spells over Bruenor\u0027s face, which was scarred from forehead, down diagonally across the eye, to the left side of his jaw. The wound was an old one by that point, and the cleric had predicted that his work would do little more than cosmetic repair. Indeed, it took several months for a new eye to appear, deep within the folds of the scar, and some time after that for the orb to grow to full size.\n Regis pulled Bruenor closer. Unexpectedly, the halfling covered Bruenor\u0027s right eye with one hand, pointed a finger of his other hand, and jabbed it at the dwarfs left eye.\n Bruenor jumped and caught the poking hand.\n \"You can see!\" the halfling exclaimed.\n Bruenor grabbed Regis in a tight hug, even swung him completely about. It was true, the dwarf\u0027s sight had returned in his left eye!\n Several other patrons in the store watched the emotional outburst, and as soon as Bruenor became aware of their stares, and even worse, their smiles, he dropped Regis roughly back to the floor.\n Maboyo arrived then, his arms full with a coil of heavy rope. \"Will this meet your desires?\" he asked.\n \"It\u0027s a start,\" Bruenor roared at him, the dwarf turning suddenly sour again. \"I need another thousand feet.\"\n Maboyo stared at him.\n \"Now!\" Bruenor roared. \"Ye get me the rope or I\u0027m out for Luskan with enough wagons to keep me and me kin supplied for a hunnerd years!\"\n Maboyo stared a moment longer, then gave up and headed for his storeroom. He had known the dwarf meant to clean him out of many items as soon as Bruenor had entered his store with a heavy purse. Maboyo liked to dole out supplies slowly, over time, making each purchase seem precious and extracting as much gold from the customer as possible. Bruenor, the toughest bargainer this side of the mountains, didn\u0027t play that game.\n \"Getting back your vision didn\u0027t do much to improve your mood,\" Regis remarked as soon as Maboyo was out of sight.\n Bruenor winked at him. \"Play the game, Rumblebelly,\" the dwarf said slyly. \"Suren this one\u0027s glad we\u0027re back. Doubles his business.\"\n True enough, Regis understood. With Bruenor and two hundred of Clan Battlehammer back in Icewind Dale, Maboyo\u0027s store-the largest and best-stocked in all of Bryn Shander, in all of Ten-Towns-stood to do well.\n Of course, that meant Maboyo would have to put up with the surliest of customers. Regis chuckled privately at the thought of the battles the shopkeeper and Bruenor would fight, just as it had been nearly a decade before, when the rocky valley just south of Kelvin\u0027s Cairn chimed with the ringing of dwarven hammers.\n Regis spent a long while staring at Bruenor. It was good to be home.\n Part 2\n THE FOG OF FATE\n We are the center. In each of our minds-some may call it arrogance, or selfishness-we are the center, and all the world moves about us, and for us, and because of us. This is the paradox of community, the one and the whole, the desires of the one often in direct conflict with the needs of the whole. Who among us has not wondered if all the world is no more than a personal dream?\n I do not believe that such thoughts are arrogant or selfish. It is simply a matter of perception; we can empathize with someone else, but we cannot truly see the world as another person sees it, or judge events as they affect the mind and the heart of another, even a friend.\n But we must try. For the sake of all the world, we must try. This is the test of altruism, the most basic and undeniable ingredient for society. Therein lies the paradox, for ultimately, logically, we each must care more about ourselves than about others, and yet, if, as rational beings we follow that logical course, we place our needs and desires above the needs of our society, and then there is no community.\n I come from Menzoberranzan, city of drow, city of self. I have seen that way of selfishness. I have seen it fail miserably. When self-indulgence rules, then all the community loses, and in the end, those striving for personal gains are left with nothing of any real value.\n Because everything of value that we will know in this life comes from our relationships with those around us. Because there is nothing material that measures against the intangibles of love and friendship.\n Thus, we must overcome that selfishness and we must try; we must care. I saw this truth plainly following the attack on Cap-\n tain Deudermont in Waterdeep. My first inclination was to believe that my past had precipitated the trouble, that my life course had again brought pain to a friend. I could not bear this thought. I felt old and I felt tired. Subsequently learning that the trouble was possibly brought on by Deudermont\u0027s old enemies, not my own, gave me more heart for the fight.\n Why is that? The danger to me was no less, nor was the danger to Deudermont, or to Catti-brie or any of the others about us.\n Yet my emotions were real, very real, and I recognized and understood them, if not their source. Now, in reflection, I recognize that source, and take pride in it. I have seen the failure of self-indulgence; I have run from such a world. I would rather die because of Deudermont\u0027s past than have him die because of my own. I would suffer the physical pains, even the end of my life. Better that than watch one I love suffer and die because of me. I would rather have my physical heart torn from my chest, than have my heart of hearts, the essence of love, the empathy and the need to belong to something bigger than my corporeal form, destroyed.\n They are a curious thing, these emotions. How they fly in the face of logic, how they overrule the most basic instincts. Because, in the measure of time, in the measure of humanity, we sense those self-indulgent instincts to be a weakness, we sense that the needs of the community must outweigh the desires of the one. Only when we admit to our failures and recognize our weaknesses can we rise above them.\n Together. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passage-to-dawn-legacy-of-the-drow-4/page-7.html","bookId":2130,"book":{"id":2130,"title":"Passage to Dawn (Legacy of the Drow #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Legacy of the Drow #4: Passage to Dawn \n Revenge and Resurrection in a Frozen Wasteland!
