{"id":94417,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Captain Deudermont seemed out of place indeed as he strolled down Dock Street, the infamous, rough and tumble avenue that lined Waterdeep Harbor. His clothes were fine and perfectly tailored to his tall and thin frame, his posture was perfect, and his hair and goatee meticulously groomed. All about him, the scurvy sea dogs who had put in for their weeks ashore staggered out of taverns, reeking of ale, or fell down unconscious in the dust. The only thing protecting them from the many robbers lurking in the area was the fact that they had no money or valuables to steal. Deudermont ignored the sights, and didn\u0027t fancy himself any better than those sea dogs. In fact, there was an aspect of their way of life that intrigued the gentlemanly captain, an honesty that mocked the pretentious courts of nobles. Deudermont pulled his layered cloak tighter about his neck, warding off the chill night breeze that blew in off the harbor. Normally one would not walk alone down Dock Street, not even in the light of noonday, but Deudermont felt secure. He carried his decorated cutlass at his side, and knew how to use it well. Even more than that, the word had been passed through every tavern and every pier in Waterdeep that the Sea Sprite\u0027s captain had been afforded the personal protection of the Lords of Waterdeep, including some very powerful wizards who would seek out and destroy anyone bothering the captain or his crew while they were in port. Waterdeep was the Sea Sprite\u0027s haven, and so Deudermont thought nothing of walking alone down Dock Street. He was more curious than fearful when a wrinkled old man, bone skinny and barely five feet tall, called to him from the edge of an alleyway. Deudermont stopped and looked about. Dock Street was quiet, except for the overspill of sound from the many taverns and the groan of old wood against the incessant sea breeze. \"Ye\u0027s is Doo-dor-mont-ee, asin\u0027t yer?\" the old seabones called softly, a whistle accompanying each syllable. He smiled widely, almost lewdly, showing but a couple of crooked teeth set in black gums. Deudermont stopped and eyed the man patiently, silently. He felt no compulsion to answer the question. \"If ye be,\" the man wheezed, \"then oi\u0027ve got a bit o\u0027 news for yer. A warnin\u0027 from a man yer\u0027s is rightly fearin\u0027.\" The captain stood tall and impassive. His face showed none of the questions that raced about in his mind. Who would he be afraid of? Was the old dog talking of Pinochet? That seemed likely, especially considering the two caravels the Sea Sprite had escorted into Waterdeep Harbor earlier that week. But few in Waterdeep had any contact with the pirate, whose domain was much farther to the south, south of Baldur\u0027s Gate even, in the straights near the Moonshae Isles. But who else might the man be talking about? Smiling still, the sea dog motioned for Deudermont to come to the alley. The captain didn\u0027t move as the old man turned and took a step in. \"Well, be yer fearin\u0027 old Scaramundi?\" the sea dog whistled. Deudermont realized it could be a disguise. Many of the greatest assassins in the Realms could look as helpless as this one, only to put a poisoned dagger into their victim\u0027s chest. The sea dog came back to the entrance to the alley, then walked right out into the middle of the street toward Deudermont. No disguise, the captain told himself, for it was too complete, too perfect. Besides, he recollected that he had seen this same old man before, usually sitting right near to this very same alleyway, which probably served as his home. What then? Might there be an ambush set down that alley? \"Have it yer own way then,\" the old man wheezed as he threw up one hand. He leaned heavily on his walking stick and started back to the alley, grumbling. \"Just a messenger, I be, and not fer carin\u0027 if yer hears the news or not!\" Deudermont cautiously looked all around again. Seeing nobody nearby, and no likely hiding spots for an ambush party, he moved to the mouth of the alleyway. The old sea dog was ten short paces in, at the edge of the slanting shadows cast by the building to the right, and barely visible in the dimness. He laughed and coughed and moved in yet another step. One hand on the hilt of his cutlass, Deudermont cautiously approached, scanning carefully before each step. The alleyway seemed empty enough. \"Far enough!\" Deudermont said suddenly, stopping the sea dog in his tracks. \"If you have news for me, then speak it, and speak it now.\" \"Some things shouldn\u0027t be said too loudly,\" the old man replied. \"Now,\" Deudermont insisted. The salty sea dog smiled widely and coughed, perhaps laughing. He ambled back a few steps, stopping barely three feet from Deudermont. The smell of the man nearly overwhelmed the captain, who was accustomed to powerful body odors. There wasn\u0027t much opportunity to bathe on a ship at sea and the Sea Sprite was often out for weeks, even months, at a time. Still, the combination of cheap wine and old sweat gave this one a particularly nasty flavor that made Deudermont scrunch up his face, even put a hand over his nose to try to intercept some of the fumes. The sea dog, of course, laughed hysterically at that. \"Now!\" the captain insisted. Even as the word left Deudermont\u0027s lips, the sea dog reached out and caught him by the wrist. Deudermont, not afraid, turned his arm, but the old man held on stubbornly. \"I want you to tell me of the dark one,\" the sea dog said, and it took Deudermont a moment to realize that the man\u0027s dockside accent was gone. \"Who are you?\" Deudermont insisted, and he tugged fiercely, to no avail. Only then did Deudermont realize the truth of the superhuman grip; he might as well have been pulling against one of the great fog giants that lived on the reef surrounding Delmarin Island, far to the south. \"The dark one,\" the old man repeated. With hardly any effort, he yanked Deudermont deeper into the alleyway. The captain went for his cutlass, and though the old man held Deudermont\u0027s right hand fast, he could fight fairly well with his left. It was somewhat awkward extracting the curving blade from its sheath with that hand, and before the cutlass came fully free, the old man\u0027s free hand shot forward, open-palmed, to slam Deudermont in the face. He flew backward, crashing against the wall. Keeping his wits about him, he drew out the blade, transferred it to his now-free right hand, and slashed hard at the ribs of the approaching sea dog. The fine cutlass gashed deep into the sea dog\u0027s side, but he didn\u0027t even flinch. Deudermont tried to block the next slap, and the next after that, but his defenses simply were not strong enough. He tried to get his cutlass in line to parry, but the old man slapped it away, sent it spinning from his hand, then resumed the battering. Open palms came in with the speed of a striking snake, heavy blows that knocked Deudermont\u0027s head tilting, and he would have fallen, except that the old man grabbed him by the shoulder and held him fast. Through bleary eyes, Deudermont peered at his foe. Confusion crossed his stern features as his enemy\u0027s face began to melt away and then to reform. \"The dark one?\" he, it, asked again, and Deudermont hardly heard the voice, his voice, so dumbfounded was he at the spectacle of his own face leering back at him. \"He should be here by now,\" Catti-brie remarked, leaning on the bar. She was growing impatient, Drizzt realized, and not because Deudermont was late-the captain was often detained at one function or another in Waterdeep-but because the sailor on the other side of her, a short and stocky man with a thick beard and curly hair, both the color of a raven\u0027s wing, kept bumping into her. He apologized each time, looking over his shoulder to regard the beautiful woman, often winking and always smiling. Drizzt turned so that his back was against the waist-high bar. The Mermaid\u0027s Arms was nearly empty this night. The weather had been fine and most of the fishing and merchant fleets were out. Still, the place was loud and rowdy, full of sailors relieving months of boredom with drink, companionship, much bluster and even fisticuffs. \"Robillard,\" Drizzt whispered, and Catti-brie turned and followed the drow\u0027s gaze to see the wizard slipping through the crowd, moving to join them at the bar. \"Good evening,\" the wizard said without much enthusiasm. He didn\u0027t look at the companions as he spoke, and didn\u0027t wait for the bartender to come near, merely waggled his fingers and a bottle and a glass magically came to his place. The bartender started to protest, but a pile of copper pieces appeared in his hand. The bartender shook his head with disdain, never caring much for the Sea Sprite\u0027s wizard and his arrogant antics, and moved away. \"Where is Deudermont?\" Robillard asked. \"Squandering my pay, no doubt.\" Drizzt and Catti-brie exchanged smiles wrought of continued disbelief. Robillard was among the most distant and caustic men either of them had ever known, more grumpy even than General Dagna, the surly dwarf who served as Bruenor\u0027s garrison commander at Mithril Hall. \"No doubt,\" Drizzt replied. Robillard turned to regard him with an accusing, angry glare. \"Of course, Deudermont\u0027s one to steal from us all the time,\" Catti-brie added. \"Takes a fancy to the finest o\u0027 ladies and the finest o\u0027 wine, and is free with what\u0027s not his to be free with.\" A growl escaped Robillard\u0027s thin lips and he pushed off the bar and walked away. \"I\u0027d like to know that one\u0027s tale,\" Catti-brie remarked. Drizzt nodded his accord, his eyes never leaving the departing wizard\u0027s back. Indeed, Robillard was a strange one, and the drow figured that something terrible must have happened to him somewhere in his past. Perhaps he had unintentionally killed someone, or had been rejected by a true love. Perhaps he had seen too much of wizardry, had looked into places where a man\u0027s eyes were not meant to go. Catti-brie\u0027s simple spoken thought had sparked a sudden interest within Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. Who was this Robillard, and what precipitated his perpetual boredom and anger? \"Where is Deudermont?\" came a question from the side, breaking Drizzt\u0027s trance. He turned to see Waillan Micanty, a lad of barely twenty winters, with sandy-colored hair, cinnamon eyes and huge dimples that always showed because Waillan never seemed to stop smiling. He was the youngest of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crew, younger even than Catti-brie, but with an uncanny eye on the ballista. Waillan\u0027s shots were fast becoming legend, and if the young man lived long enough, he would no doubt assemble quite a reputation along the Sword Coast. Waillan Micanty had put one ballista bolt through the window of a pirate captain\u0027s quarters at four hundred yards and had skewered the pirate captain as the man was buckling on his cutlass. The momentum of the heavy spear had hurled the pirate right through his closed cabin door and out onto the deck. The pirate ship struck her colors immediately, the capture ended before the fighting had really even begun. \"We are expecting the man,\" Drizzt answered, his mood brightening simply at the sight of the beaming young man. Drizzt couldn\u0027t help but notice the contrast between this youngster and Robillard, who was probably the oldest of the crew, except for Drizzt. Waillan nodded. \"Should be here by now,\" he remarked under his breath, but the drow\u0027s keen ears caught every word. \"You are expecting him?\" Drizzt was quick to ask. \"I need to speak with him,\" Waillan admitted, \"about a possible advance on earnings.\" The young man blushed deep red and moved close to Drizzt so that Catti-brie could not hear. \"A lady friend,\" he explained. Drizzt found his smile widening even more. \"The captain is overdue,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure he will not be much longer.\" \"He was less than a dozen doors down when I last saw him,\" Waillan said. \"Near to the Foggy Haven and heading this way. I thought he\u0027d beat me here.\" For the first time, Drizzt grew a bit concerned. \"How long ago was that?\" Waillan shrugged. \"I been here since the fight before,\" he said. Drizzt turned and leaned back against the bar. He and Catti-brie exchanged concerned looks this time, for many minutes had passed since the previous two fights. There wasn\u0027t much to interest the captain between the Mermaid\u0027s Arms and the place Waillan spoke of, certainly nothing that should have detained Deudermont for this long. Drizzt sighed and took a long swallow of the water he was drinking. He looked to Robillard, now sitting by himself, though a table not far from the man held open chairs beside the four that were occupied by members of the Sea Sprite\u0027s crew. Drizzt wasn\u0027t too concerned. Perhaps Deudermont had forgotten some business, or had simply changed his mind about coming to the Mermaid\u0027s Arms this night. But still, Dock Street in Waterdeep was a dangerous place, and the drow ranger\u0027s sixth sense, that warrior instinct, told him to be wary. Deudermont, practically senseless, did not know how long the beating went on. He was lying on the cold ground now, that much he knew. The thing, whatever it was, having assumed his exact form, clothing, even weapons, was sitting on his back. The physical torture was not so great anymore, but even worse than the beating, the captain felt the creature within his mind, probing his thoughts, gaining knowledge that it could no doubt use against his friends. You will taste fine, Deudermont heard in his thoughts. Better than the old Scaramundi. Despite the unreality of it all, the lack of true sensation, the captain felt his stomach churning. He believed he knew, in that distant corner of consciousness, what monster had come to him. Dopplegangers were not common in the Realms, but the few who had made themselves known had certainly caused enough havoc to secure the wretched reputation of the alien race. Deudermont felt himself being lifted from the ground. So strong was the grasp of the creature that the captain felt as if he were weightless, simply floating to his feet. He was spun around to face the thing, to face himself, and he expected then to be devoured. \"Not yet,\" the creature replied to his unspoken fears. \"I need your thoughts, good Captain Deudermont. I need to know enough about you and your ship to sail it out of Waterdeep Harbor, far to the west and far to the south, to an island that few know, but many speak of.\" The thing\u0027s smile was tantalizing and Deudermont had just focused fully on it when the creature\u0027s head shot forward, its forehead slamming him in the face, knocking him senseless. Some time later-he did not know how many seconds might have passed-Deudermont felt the cold ground against his cheek once more. His hands were tightly bound behind his back, his ankles likewise strapped, and a tight gag was about his mouth. He managed to turn his head enough to see the creature, wearing his form still, bending over a heavy iron grate. Deudermont could hardly believe the strength of the thing as it lifted that sewer covering, a mass of metal that had to weigh near to five hundred pounds. The creature casually leaned it against the wall of a building, then turned and grabbed Deudermont, dragging him to the opening and unceremoniously dropping him in. The stench was awful, worse than the captain would have expected even from a sewer, and when he managed to shift about and get his face out of the muck, he understood the source. Scaramundi, it had to be Scaramundi, lay beside him, caked in blood, more than half of his torso torn away, eaten by the creature. Deudermont jumped as the sewer grate clanked back into place, and then he lay still, horrified and helpless, knowing that he would soon share the same grisly fate.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/passage-to-dawn-legacy-of-the-drow-4/page-3.html","bookId":2130,"book":{"id":2130,"title":"Passage to Dawn (Legacy of the Drow #4)","description":"Storyline: Legacy of the Drow #4: Passage to Dawn Revenge and Resurrection in a Frozen Wasteland!
