{"id":34419,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. MIKE\u0027S THEFT IS DISCOVERED.","content":"Dan was standing in front of the Astor House, talking to a boy acquaintance, when his mother tottered up to him in a state of great nervous agitation. \"Why, mother, what\u0027s the matter?\" asked Dan, in surprise. \"What brings you out this afternoon?\" \"Oh, Dan!\" she gasped, \"are you hurt?\" Dan opened his eyes in wonder. It occurred to him that his mother must have lost her mind. \"Hurt!\" he repeated. \"Yes; they told me you were run over, and had your leg broken.\" \"My leg broken! Who told you so?\" \"Mike Rafferty.\" \"Then I wish I had him here,\" said Dan, indignantly; \"I\u0027d let him know whether my leg is broken or not. You bet I would!\" \"Haven\u0027t you been run over, then?\" \"Not that I know of, and I guess it couldn\u0027t be done without my knowing it.\" \"I am so glad, so relieved!\" sighed Mrs. [Pg 70]Mordaunt. \"I don\u0027t know how I got here, I was so agitated.\" \"When did Mike Rafferty tell you this cock-and-bull story, mother?\" asked Dan. \"Only a few minutes ago. He said you had been taken into a drug store, and wanted me to come right over.\" \"It\u0027s a mean trick he played on you, mother,\" said Dan, indignantly. \"I don\u0027t see what made him do it.\" \"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt. \"He must have meant it as a joke.\" \"A pretty poor joke. I\u0027ll get even with him for that.\" \"I don\u0027t mind it now, Dan, since I have you safe. I am ready to forgive him. He didn\u0027t know how much he was distressing me.\" \"Then he ought to have known. You may forgive him if you want to; I sha\u0027n\u0027t.\" \"I will go home now, Dan. I feel a good deal happier than I did when I was hurrying over here.\" \"I will go with you, mother. I have sold my papers, and sha\u0027n\u0027t work any more this afternoon. Where did you leave Mike? I hope I can come across him soon.\" \"I left him at the door of our room.\" [Pg 71] \"Did you lock the door when you came away, mother?\" asked Dan. \"No; I believe not.\" \"Then let us go home at once. Some one might get in.\" \"There isn\u0027t much to take, Dan,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, with a faint smile. \"There is our rent money, mother.\" \"I didn\u0027t think of that.\" \"We shall be in a pretty pickle if that is lost.\" \"You don\u0027t think Mike would take it do you, Dan?\" \"I think he would if he knew where to find it.\" \"I wish I had brought it with me,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, in a tone of anxiety. \"Don\u0027t fret, mother; I guess it\u0027s all right.\" \"Perhaps you had better go home at once without waiting for me, Dan. You can go quicker.\" \"All right; I\u0027ll do it. Where is the money?\" \"In my pocket-book, in the drawer of the work-table.\" \"Are the drawers locked?\" \"No.\" \"Then hereafter you\u0027d better lock them. Well, I\u0027ll be off, and will meet you at the room.\" Dan was not long in reaching his humble home. The more he thought of it, the more he distrusted[Pg 72] Mike, and feared that he might have had a sinister design in the deception he had practiced upon his mother. To lose the rent money would be a serious matter. Mr. Grab hated him, he knew full well, and would show no mercy, while in the short time remaining it would be quite impossible to make up the necessary sum. Dan sprang up the stairs, several at a bound, and made his way at once to the little work-table. He pulled the drawer open without ceremony, and in feverish haste rummaged about until, to his great joy, he found the pocket-book. His heart gave a joyous bound. \"It\u0027s all right, after all,\" he said. \"Mike isn\u0027t so bad as I thought him.\" He opened the pocket-book, and his countenance fell. There was a twenty-five cent scrip in one of the compartments, and that was all. \"He\u0027s stolen the money, after all,\" he said, his heart sinking. \"What are we going to do now?\" He waited till his mother reached home. She looked inquiringly at him. One glance told her what had happened. \"Is it gone, Dan?\" she gasped. \"That is all that is left,\" answered Dan, holding up the scrip. \"Mike could not be wicked enough to take it.\" [Pg 73] \"Couldn\u0027t he, though? You don\u0027t know him as I do, mother. He\u0027s a mean thief, and he sent you off to have a clear field. I wish you had locked the door.\" \"I couldn\u0027t think of that, or anything else, Dan, when I thought you were hurt.\" \"That\u0027s why he told you.\" \"What can we do, Dan? Mr. Grab will be angry when he finds we can\u0027t pay him.\" \"I will try to find Mike; and if I do, I will get the money if I can. That\u0027s the first thing.\" Dan went up stairs at once, and knocked at Mrs. Rafferty\u0027s door. She came to the door, her arms dripping with suds, for she had been washing. \"Is it you, Dan?\" she said. \"And how is your mother to-day?\" \"Is Mike in?\" asked Dan, abruptly, too impatient to answer the question. \"No; he went out quarter of an hour ago.\" \"Did he tell you where he was going, Mrs. Rafferty?\" \"Yes, he did. He said he was going over to Brooklyn to see if he could get a job, shure. Did you want him?\" \"Yes, I did, Mrs. Rafferty. I\u0027m sorry to tell you that Mike has played a bad trick on my mother.\" [Pg 74] \"Oh, whirra, whirra, what a bye he is!\" wailed Mrs. Rafferty. \"He\u0027s always up to something bad. Sorra bit of worruk he does, and I at the wash-tub all day long.\" \"He\u0027s a bad son to you, Mrs. Rafferty.\" \"So he is, Dan, dear. I wish he was like you. And what kind of trick has he played on your good mother?\" \"He told her that I had been run over and broken my leg. Of course she went out to find me, thinking it was all true, and while she was away he took the money from her pocket-book.\" Some mothers would have questioned this statement, but Mrs. Rafferty knew to her cost that Mike was capable of stealing, having been implicated in thefts on several occasions. \"Was it much, Dan?\" she asked. \"Six or seven dollars. I can\u0027t say just how much.\" \"Oh, what a bad bye! I don\u0027t know what to do wid him, shure.\" \"It was the money we were to pay our rent with to-morrow,\" continued Dan. \"It is a very serious matter.\" \"I wish I could make it up to you, Dan, dear. It\u0027s a shame it is.\" \"You are an honest woman, Mrs. Rafferty, but you[Pg 75] ought not to make it up. I wish I could find Mike. Do you think he has really gone to Brooklyn.\" \"Shure, I don\u0027t know. He said so.\" \"He might have done it as a blind, just to put me on the wrong scent.\" \"So he might, shure.\" \"Well, Mrs. Rafferty, I can\u0027t stop any longer. I\u0027ll try to find him.\" He went down stairs and told his mother what he had discovered or failed to discover. \"Don\u0027t wait supper for me, mother,\" he said. \"I\u0027m going in search of Mike.\" \"You won\u0027t fight with him, Dan?\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, anxiously. \"I can\u0027t promise, mother. I will only agree to be prudent. I am not going to submit to the loss without trying to get the money back, you may be sure of that.\" So Dan went down stairs, considerably perplexed in mind. Mike was sure to keep out of the way for a time at least, anticipating that Dan would be upon his track. While our hero was searching for him, he would have plenty of opportunities of spending the money of which he had obtained unlawful possession. To punish him without regaining the contents of the lost pocket-book would be an empty triumph. In the[Pg 76] street below Dan espied Terence Quinn, an acquaintance of Mike. \"How are you, Terence?\" he said. \"Have you seen anything of Mike?\" \"I saw him only a few minutes ago.\" \"Where did he go?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I want to see him on business.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you where he\u0027ll be this evening.\" \"Where?\" \"He\u0027s going to the Old Bowery, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 wid him.\" \"Does he treat?\" \"Yes.\" \"Where did he get the money?\" \"He didn\u0027t tell me,\" said Terence. \"He\u0027s taken the rent money. I\u0027m sure of it now,\" said Dan to himself. \"I wish I knew where to find him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81433.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
