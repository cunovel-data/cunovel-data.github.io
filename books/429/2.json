{"id":34412,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. DAN AT HOME.","content":"While Dan was strong, sturdy, and the picture of health, his mother was evidently an invalid. She was pale, thin, and of delicate appearance. She was sitting in a cane-seated rocking-chair, which Dan had bought second-hand on one of his flush days at a small place on the Bowery. She looked up with a glad smile when Dan entered. \"I am so glad to see you, my dear boy,\" she said. \"Have you been lonely, mother?\" asked Dan, kissing her affectionately. \"Yes, Dan, it is lonely sitting here hour after hour without you, but I have my work to think of.\" \"I wish you didn\u0027t have to work, mother,\" said Dan. \"You are not strong enough. I ought to earn enough to support us both.\" \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself about that, my dear boy. I should feel more lonely if I had nothing to do.\" \"But you work all the time. I don\u0027t like to have you do that.\" In truth the mother was very tired, and her feeble[Pg 17] fingers were cramped with the stitch, stitch, stitch in endless repetition, but she put on a cheerful countenance. \"Well, Dan, I\u0027ll stop now that you are at home. You want some supper.\" \"Let me get it, mother.\" \"No, Dan, it will be a relief to me to stir around a little, as I have been sitting so long.\" \"Oh, I nearly forgot, mother—here\u0027s a nice pear I bought for you.\" \"It does look nice,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt. \"I don\u0027t feel hungry, but I can eat that. But where is yours, Dan?\" \"Oh, I\u0027ve eaten mine,\" answered Dan, hastily. It was not true, but God will forgive such falsehoods. \"You\u0027d better eat half of this.\" \"No; I\u0027ll be——flummuxed if I do,\" said Dan, pausing a little for an unobjectionable word. Mrs. Mordaunt set the little table for two. On it she spread a neat cloth, and laid the plain supper—a plate of bread, ditto of butter, and a few slices of cold meat. Soon the tea was steeped, and mother and son sat down for the evening meal. \"I say, mother, this is a jolly supper,\" said Dan. \"I get awfully hungry by supper-time.\" [Pg 18] \"You are a growing boy, Dan. I am glad you have an appetite.\" \"But you eat next to nothing, mother,\" said Dan, uneasily. \"I am not a growing boy,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, smiling. \"I shall relish my supper to-night on account of the pear you brought me.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad I thought of it,\" said Dan, heartily. \"Pears ain\u0027t solid enough for me; I want something hearty to give me strength.\" \"Of course you do, Dan. You have to work hard.\" \"I work hard, mother! Why, I have the easiest time going. All I do is to walk about the streets, or stand in front of the Astor House and ask people to buy my papers. Oh, by the way, who do you think I saw to-day?\" \"Any of our old friends?\" asked Mrs. Mordaunt. \"Any of our old friends! I should say not,\" answered Dan, disdainfully. \"It was Tom Carver.\" \"Was it he? He used to sit next you in school, didn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes, for six months. Tom and I were chums.\" \"Did he say whether his family was well?\" \"What are you thinking of, mother? Do you suppose Tom Carver would notice me, now that I am a poor newsboy?\" [Pg 19] \"Why shouldn\u0027t he?\" demanded the mother, her pale face flushing. \"Why shouldn\u0027t he notice my boy?\" \"Because he doesn\u0027t choose to,\" answered Dan, with a short laugh. \"Didn\u0027t you know it was disgraceful to be poor?\" \"Thank Heaven, it isn\u0027t that!\" ejaculated Mrs. Mordaunt. \"Well, it might as well be. Tom thinks me beneath his notice now. You should have seen him turn his head to the other side as he walked by, twirling his light cane.\" \"Did you speak to him, Dan?\" \"What do you take me for, mother? Do you think I\u0027d speak to a fellow that doesn\u0027t want to know me?\" \"I think you are proud, my boy.\" \"Well, mother, I guess you\u0027re right. I\u0027m too proud to force myself upon the notice of Tom Carver, or any other purse-proud sneak.\" Dan spoke with a tinge of bitterness, and it was evident that he felt Tom\u0027s slight more than he was willing to acknowledge. \"It\u0027s the way of the world, Dan,\" said his mother, sighing. \"Not one of all my friends, or those whom I accounted such, in my prosperous days, has come to see us, or shown any interest in our fate.\" [Pg 20] \"They can stay away. We can do without them,\" said Dan, sturdily. \"We must; but it would be pleasant to see some of the old faces,\" said his mother, plaintively. \"There is no one in this house that is company for me.\" \"No, mother; you are an educated and refined lady, and they are poor and ignorant.\" \"They are very good people, some of them. There is Mrs. Burke on the next floor. She was in this afternoon, and asked if she couldn\u0027t do something for me. She thought I looked poorly, she said.\" \"She\u0027s a brick, mother!\" \"My dear Dan, you do use such extraordinary language sometimes. You didn\u0027t talk so when we lived on Madison avenue.\" \"No, mother, but I associate with a different class now. I can\u0027t help catching the phrases I hear all the time. But don\u0027t mind, mother; I mean no harm. I never swear—that is, almost never. I did catch myself at it the other day, when another newsboy stole half a dozen of my papers.\" \"Don\u0027t forget that you are a gentleman, Dan.\" \"I won\u0027t if I can help it, mother, though I don\u0027t believe anybody else would suspect it. I must take good care not to look into the looking-glass, or I might be under the impression that I was a street-boy instead of a gentleman.\" [Pg 21] \"Clothes don\u0027t make the gentleman, Dan. I want you to behave and feel like a gentleman, even if your clothes are poor and patched.\" \"I understand you, mother, and I shall try to follow your advice. I have never done any mean thing yet that I can remember, and I don\u0027t intend to.\" \"I am sure of that, my dear boy.\" \"Don\u0027t be too sure of anything, mother. I have plenty of bad examples before me.\" \"But you won\u0027t be guided by them?\" \"I\u0027ll try not.\" \"Did you succeed well in your sales to-day, Dan?\" \"Pretty well. I made ninety-six cents.\" \"I wish I could earn as much,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, sighing. \"I can only earn twenty cents a day.\" \"You earn as much as I do, mother, but you don\u0027t get it. You see, there\u0027s a difference in earning and being paid. Old Gripp is a mean skinflint. I should like to force one of his twenty-cent vests down his miserly throat.\" \"Don\u0027t use such violent language, Dan. Perhaps he pays me all he can afford.\" \"Perhaps he does, but I wouldn\u0027t bet high on it. He is making a fortune out of those who sew for him.[Pg 22] There are some men that have no conscience. I hope some time you will be free from him.\" \"I hope so, too, Dan, but I am thankful to earn something. I don\u0027t want all the burden of our maintenance to fall on you.\" \"Don\u0027t call it a burden, mother. There\u0027s nothing I enjoy so much as working for you. Why, it\u0027s fun!\" \"It can\u0027t be fun on rainy, disagreeable days, Dan.\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be fun for you, mother, but you\u0027re not a boy.\" \"I am so sorry that you can\u0027t keep on with your education, Dan. You were getting on so well at school.\" It was a thought that had often come to Dan, but he wouldn\u0027t own it, for he did not wish to add to his mother\u0027s sadness. \"Oh, well, mother,\" he said, \"something may turn up for us, so we won\u0027t look down in the mouth.\" \"I have got my bundled work ready, Dan, if you can carry it round to Mr. Gripp\u0027s to-night.\" \"Yes, mother, I\u0027ll carry it. How many vests are there?\" \"There are six. That amounts to a dollar and twenty cents. I hope he\u0027ll pay you to-night, for our rent comes due to-morrow.\" \"So it does!\" ejaculated Dan, seriously. \"I never[Pg 23] thought of it. Shall we have enough to pay it? You\u0027ve got my money, you know.\" \"We shall be a dollar short.\" \"Even if old Gripp pays for the vests?\" \"Yes.\" Dan whistled—a whistle of dismay and anxiety, for he well knew that the landlord was a hard man.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81426.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
