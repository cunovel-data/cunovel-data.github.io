{"id":34431,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.","content":"As Dan entered the store he noticed that Talbot looked excited and nervous. Ordinarily the book-keeper would have reprimanded him sharply for his late arrival, but he was not disposed to be strict this morning. \"I\u0027m a little late this morning, Mr. Talbot,\" said Dan. \"Oh, well, you can be excused for once,\" said Talbot. He wished to disarm suspicion by extra good humor. Besides, he intended to send Dan to the bank presently for a heavy sum, and thought it best to be on friendly terms with him. About ten o\u0027clock a messenger entered the store with a note from Mr. Rogers to the book-keeper. It was to this effect: \"I am feeling rather out of sorts this morning, and shall not come to the store. Should you desire to consult me on any subject, send a messenger to my house.\" Talbot read this note with great satisfaction. The[Pg 159] only obstacle to carrying out his plans was the apprehended presence and vigilance of his employer. Now he had a clear field. About one o\u0027clock he called Dan into the office. \"Here, Dan,\" he said, \"I want you to go to the bank at once.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Here is a check for twelve thousand dollars—rather a heavy amount—and you must be very careful not to lose any of it, or to let any one see that you have so much with you. Do you understand?\" \"Yes, sir. In what denominations shall I get the money?\" \"You may get one hundred dollars in fives and tens, and the remainder in large bills.\" \"All right, sir.\" \"He means to make a big haul,\" said Dan to himself, as he left the store. \"I hope our plans won\u0027t miscarry. I wouldn\u0027t like Mr. Rogers to lose so large a sum.\" As Dan left the store a man of middle size, who was lounging against a lamp-post, eyed him sharply. As Dan was turning the corner of the street he left his post, and, walking rapidly, overtook him. \"Where are you going?\" he asked. \"What is that to you?\" demanded Dan. [Pg 160] \"You are in the employ of Barton \u0026 Rogers, are you not?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Is your name Dan?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I am a detective, on watch here by order of Mr. Rogers. Now will you answer my question?\" \"Certainly. I am going to the bank.\" \"To draw money?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How much?\" \"Twelve thousand dollars.\" \"Whew! That is a big sum. Who sent you?\" \"Mr. Talbot.\" \"He is the book-keeper, is he not?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"I will walk along with you. There is no need of watching till you bring back the money. Where do you think Talbot will put the money?\" \"In the safe, I think, sir.\" \"I am not sure of that. I believe he will retain the greater part on his own person. If the men who are to rob the safe got hold of all the money they would be likely to keep it, and not limit themselves to the sum he agrees to pay them.\" \"I suppose you are right, sir. What, then, are we to do?\" asked Dan, perplexed. [Pg 161] \"I shall take care to keep Talbot in view. He doesn\u0027t propose to run away. He means to have it understood that all this money has been taken by the burglars, whereas but a tithe of the sum will be deposited in the safe.\" Dan nodded assent. He was convinced that the detective was right. Still he was anxious. \"It seems to me there is a risk of losing the money,\" he said. The detective smiled. \"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" he said, confidentially. \"Talbot won\u0027t leave the city. I will take care of that.\" His words inspired confidence, and Dan entered the bank without misgivings. The check was so large that the bank officials scrutinized it carefully. There was no doubt about its being correct, however. \"How will you have it?\" was asked. Dan answered as he had been directed. \"Be very careful, young man,\" said the disbursing clerk. \"You\u0027ve got too much to lose.\" \"All right, sir.\" Dan deposited one roll of bills in the left inside pocket of his coat, and the balance in the right pocket, and then buttoned up the coat. \"I\u0027m a boy of fortune for a short time,\" he said to[Pg 162] himself. \"I hope the time will come when I shall have as much money of my own.\" Dan observed that the detective followed him at a little distance, and it gave him a feeling of security. Some one might have seen the large sum of money paid him, and instances had been known where boys in such circumstances had suddenly been set upon in the open street at midday and robbed. He felt that he had a friend near at hand who would interfere in such a case. \"What time is it, boy?\" asked an ill-looking man, suddenly accosting him. \"Half-past one.\" \"Look at your watch.\" \"I don\u0027t carry one,\" said Dan, eying the questioner suspiciously. \"Nor I. I have been very unfortunate. Can\u0027t you give me a quarter to buy me some dinner?\" \"Ask some one else; I\u0027m in a hurry,\" said Dan, coldly. The man went away muttering. \"I\u0027m not as green as you take me for,\" said Dan to himself. He thought his danger was over, but he was mistaken. Suddenly a large man, with red hair and beard,[Pg 163] emerging from Dan knew not where, laid his hand on his shoulder. Dan turned in surprise. \"Boy,\" said he, in a fierce undertone, \"give me that money you have in your coat-pocket, or I will brain you.\" \"You forget we are in the public street,\" said Dan. \"No, I don\u0027t.\" \"You would be arrested.\" \"And you would be—stunned, perhaps killed!\" hissed the man. \"Look here, boy, I am a desperate man. I know how much money you have with you. Give me half, and go.\" Dan looked out of the corner of his eye, to see the detective close at hand. This gave him courage, for he recognized that the villain was only speaking the truth, and he did not wish to run any unnecessary risk. He gave a nod, which brought the detective nearer, and then slipped to one side, calling: \"Stop thief!\" The ruffian made a dash for him, his face distorted with rage, but his arm was grasped as by an iron vise. \"Not so fast, Jack Benton!\" exclaimed the detective, and he signaled to a policeman. \"You are up to your old tricks again, as I expected.\" \"Who are you?\" demanded Jack, angrily. \"A detective.\" [Pg 164] \"The devil!\" ejaculated the foiled burglar. \"I have taken nothing,\" he added, sullenly. \"That isn\u0027t your fault. I heard you threatening the boy, unless he gave up the money in his possession. Take him away, officer. I will appear against him.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Dan, gratefully. \"All right. Go on as quickly as possible. I will keep you in view.\" All this took a little time. Talbot, whose conscience was uneasy, and with good cause, awaited Dan\u0027s arrival very anxiously. \"What made you so long?\" he asked. \"A man tried to rob me.\" \"Did he succeed?\" asked Talbot, quickly. \"No; he was recognized by a policeman, who arrested him as he was on the point of attacking me.\" Talbot asked no further questions, considerably to Dan\u0027s relief, for he did not wish to mention the detective if it could be avoided. The book-keeper contented himself with saying, in a preoccupied tone, as he received the money: \"You can\u0027t be too careful when you have much money about you. I am almost sorry I sent for this money,\" he proceeded. \"I don\u0027t think I shall need to use it to-day.\" [Pg 165] \"Shall I take it back to the bank, sir?\" asked Dan. \"No; I shall put it in the safe over night. I don\u0027t care to risk you or the money again to-day.\" \"That\u0027s a blind,\" thought Dan. \"He won\u0027t put it in the safe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81445.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
