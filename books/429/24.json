{"id":34434,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. OLD JACK, THE JANITOR.","content":"The janitor, or watchman, was a sturdy old man, who in early life had been a sailor. Some accident had made him lame, and this incapacitated him for his early vocation. It had not, however, impaired his physical strength, which was very great, and Mr. Rogers was glad to employ him in his present capacity. Of his fidelity there was no question. When Jack Green—Jack was the name he generally went by—heard of the contemplated burglary, he was excited and pleased. It was becoming rather tame to him to watch night after night without interruption, and he fancied he should like a little scrimmage. He even wanted to withstand the burglars single-handed. \"What\u0027s the use of callin\u0027 in the police?\" he urged. \"It\u0027s only two men, and old Jack is a match for two.\" \"You\u0027re a strong man, Jack,\" said Dan, \"but one of the burglars is as strong as you are. I have seen him, you know. He\u0027s broad-shouldered and big-chested.\" [Pg 180] \"I ain\u0027t afraid of him,\" said Jack, defiantly. \"Perhaps not, but there\u0027s another man, too. You couldn\u0027t overcome both.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that.\" But Jack finally yielded, though reluctantly, and three policemen were admitted about eight o\u0027clock, and carefully secreted, to act when necessary. Jack pleaded for the privilege of meeting the burglars first, and the privilege was granted, partly in order that they might be taken in the act. Old Jack was instructed how to act, and though it was a part not wholly in accordance with his fearless spirit, he finally agreed to do as he was told. It is not necessary to explain how the burglars effected their entrance. This was effected about twelve o\u0027clock, and by the light of a dark-lantern Bill and Mike advanced cautiously toward the safe. At this point old Jack made his appearance, putting on an air of alarm and dismay. \"Who are you?\" he demanded, in a tone which he partially succeeded in making tremulous. Bill took up the reply. \"Are you the janitor?\" he asked. \"Yes, gentlemen. What do you want?\" \"Keep quiet, and we will do you no harm. We want you to open the safe.\" [Pg 181] \"I can\u0027t do that, gentlemen. I can\u0027t betray my trust.\" \"All right; I\u0027ll do it myself. Give us the key. What\u0027s the combination?\" \"Hartford.\" Bill glanced at Mike significantly. The word agreed with the information they had received from Talbot. It served to convince them that the janitor had indeed succumbed, and could be relied upon. There was no suspicion in the mind of either that there was any one else in the establishment, and they felt moderately secure from interruption. \"Here, old fellow, hold the lantern while we go to work. Just behave yourself, and we\u0027ll give you ten dollars—shall we, Mike?\" \"Yes,\" answered Mike; \"I\u0027m agreed.\" \"It\u0027ll look as if I was helpin\u0027 to rob my master,\" objected Jack. \"Oh, never mind about that; he won\u0027t know it. When all is over we\u0027ll tie you up, so that it will look as if you couldn\u0027t help yourself. What do you say?\" Jack felt like making a violent assault upon the man who was offering him a bribe, but he controlled his impulse, and answered: \"I\u0027m a poor man, and ten dollars will come handy.\" [Pg 182] \"All right,\" said Bill, convinced by this time that Jack\u0027s fidelity was very cheaply purchased. He plumed himself on his success in converting the janitor into an ally, and felt that the way was clear before him. \"Mike, give the lantern to this old man, and come here and help me.\" Old Jack took the lantern, laughing in his sleeve at the ease with which he had gulled the burglars, while they kneeled before the safe. It was then that, looking over his shoulder, he noticed the stealthy approach of the policemen, accompanied by Dan. He could content himself no longer. Setting down the lantern, he sprang upon the back of Bill as he was crouching before him, exclaiming: \"Now, you villain, I have you!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81448.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
