{"id":34428,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. TWO KNIGHTS OF THE HIGHWAY.","content":"Stocks took an upward turn, so that Talbot\u0027s brokers were willing to carry them for him longer without an increase of margin. The market looked so uncertain, however, that he decided to sell, though he only made himself whole. To escape loss hardly satisfied him, when it was so essential to make money. He was deeply in love with Virginia Conway, but there was no hope of obtaining her consent to a marriage unless he could raise money enough to gratify her desires. How should he do it? He was returning to his boarding-house at a late hour one night, when, in an unfrequented street, two figures advanced upon him from the darkness, and, while one seized him by the throat, the other rifled his pockets. Talbot was not a coward, and having only a few dollars in his pocket-book, while his watch, luckily, was under repair at Tiffany\u0027s, he submitted quietly to the examination. [Pg 142] The pocket-book was opened and its contents eagerly scanned. An exclamation of disgust mingled with profanity followed. \"Only five dollars, Mike!\" muttered one of the ruffians. \"Why don\u0027t you carry money, like a gentleman?\" demanded the man called Mike. \"Ain\u0027t you ashamed to carry such a lean wallet as that there?\" \"Really, gentlemen, if I had expected to meet you, I would have provided myself better,\" said Talbot, not without a gleam of humor. \"He\u0027s chaffing us Bill,\" said Mike. \"You\u0027d better not, if you know what\u0027s best for yourself,\" growled Bill. \"Where\u0027s your ticker?\" \"My watch is at Tiffany\u0027s.\" \"That\u0027s too thin.\" \"It\u0027s the truth. You ought to have waited till next week, when I\u0027d have had it for you.\" \"You\u0027re a cool customer.\" \"Why not?\" \"We might hurt you.\" \"You have already. Don\u0027t squeeze my throat so next time.\" \"Have you any jewelry about you?\" \"Only a pair of sleeve buttons.\" \"Gold?\" [Pg 143] \"Yes; but they are small, and not worth much.\" \"You\u0027ve took us in reg\u0027lar! A gent like you ought to have diamond studs, or a pin, or something of value.\" \"I know it, and I\u0027m sorry I haven\u0027t, for your sakes.\" \"No chaffing!\" said Bill, with an ominous growl. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. I look upon you as gentlemen, and treat you accordingly. In fact, I\u0027m glad I\u0027ve met with you.\" \"Why?\" asked Mike, suspiciously. \"I may be able to put something in your way.\" \"Are you on the square?\" asked Bill, rather surprised. \"Yes.\" \"What is it?\" \"I can\u0027t tell you in the street. Is there any quiet place, where we shall not be disturbed or overheard?\" The men looked at each other in doubt. \"This may be a plant,\" said Mike, suspiciously. \"On my honor, it isn\u0027t.\" \"If it is,\" growled Bill, \"you\u0027d better make your will.\" \"I know the risk, and am not afraid. In short, I have a job for you.\" [Pg 144] The men consulted, and finally were led to put confidence in Talbot. \"Is there money in it?\" asked Mike. \"Two hundred dollars apiece.\" \"We\u0027ll hear what you have to say. Bill, let\u0027s go to your room.\" \"Is it far away?\" asked Talbot. \"No.\" \"Lead on, then.\" The three made their way to a dilapidated building on Houston street, and ascended to the fourth floor. Bill kicked open the door of a room with his foot and strode in. A thin, wretched-looking woman sat in a wooden chair, holding a young child. \"Is it you, Bill?\" she asked. \"Yes, it\u0027s me!\" growled her husband. \"Just clear out into the other room. Me and these gentlemen have business together.\" She meekly obeyed the command of her lord, glancing curiously at Talbot as she went out. Mike she knew only too well, as one of her husband\u0027s evil companions. The door was closed, but the wife bent her ear to the keyhole and listened attentively. Suspecting nothing, the conspirators spoke in louder[Pg 145] tones than they were aware of, so that she obtained a pretty clear idea of what was being planned. \"Now go ahead,\" said Bill, throwing himself on the chair his wife had vacated. \"What\u0027s your game?\" \"Can you open a safe?\" asked Talbot. \"We might, \u0027specially if we knowed the combination.\" \"Perhaps I can manage that.\" \"Where is it?\" Talbot gave the name of his employer and the number of his store. \"What have you got to do with it?\" \"I\u0027m the book-keeper.\" \"You are? What are you going to make out of it?\" \"Leave that to me. I\u0027ll guarantee that you\u0027ll find four hundred dollars there to pay you for your trouble.\" \"That isn\u0027t enough. The risk is too great.\" \"It is only one night\u0027s work.\" \"If we\u0027re caught, it\u0027ll be Sing Sing for seven years.\" \"That\u0027s true. How much do you require, gentlemen?\" The men consulted. \"We might do it for five hundred apiece,\" said Bill. [Pg 146] There was a little discussion, but finally this was acceded to. Various details were discussed, and the men separated. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 your way,\" said Mike. \"I\u0027ll show you the way out.\" \"All right, thank you, but we\u0027d better separate at the street door.\" \"Why? Are you too fine a gentleman to be seen with the likes of me?\" demanded Mike, feeling insulted. \"Not at all, my friend; but if we were seen together by any of the police, who know me as book-keeper, it would excite suspicion later.\" \"You\u0027re right. Your head\u0027s level. You\u0027re sure you\u0027re on the square?\" \"Yes, my friend. I shouldn\u0027t dare to tamper with men like you and Bill. You might find a way to get even with me.\" \"That\u0027s so, stranger. I guess we can trust you.\" \"You may be sure of that.\" \"More crime!\" said the miserable wife to herself, as she heard through the keyhole the details of the plan. \"Bill is getting worse and worse every day. Where will it all end?\" \"Here, Nancy, get me something to eat,\" said Bill, when his visitors had departed. \"Yes, Bill, I will get you all there is.\" [Pg 147] The wife brought out from a small closet a slice of bread and a segment of cheese. \"Pah!\" said the burly ruffian, turning up his nose. \"What are you giving us?\" \"It\u0027s all I\u0027ve got, Bill.\" \"Where\u0027s the meat, I say?\" \"There is none.\" \"You and your brat have eaten it!\" said he, irritably. \"God help us, Bill! We have had no meat for a week.\" \"That\u0027s a lie! I can\u0027t eat such trash as that. Do you mean to starve me?\" \"I can\u0027t make food, Bill. If you will give money, I will provide better. I can\u0027t do anything without money.\" \"Whining, are you?\" said the brute, furiously. \"I\u0027ll teach you to complain of me. Take that, and that!\" and he struck the woman two brutal blows with his fist. One, glancing, struck the child, who began to cry. This further irritated Bill, who, seizing his wife by the shoulders, thrust her out on the landing. \"There, stay there with the cursed brat!\" he growled. \"I mean to have one quiet night.\" The wretched wife crept down stairs, and out into the street, scarcely knowing what she did. She was[Pg 148] not wholly destitute of spirit, and though she might have forgiven personal injury, felt incensed by the treatment of her innocent child. \"My poor baby!\" she said, pitifully, \"must you suffer because your father is a brute? May Heaven avenge our wrongs! Sooner or later it will.\" She sat down on some steps near by; the air was chilly, and she shivered with the cold, but she tried to shelter her babe as well as she could. She attracted the attention of a boy who was walking slowly by. It was Dan, who had at a distance witnessed Talbot\u0027s encounter with the burglars, and his subsequent friendly companionship with them, and was trying to ascertain the character of the place which he visited. \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy. What\u0027s the matter with you \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked Dan, in a tone of sympathy. \"My husband has thrust me out of doors with my poor baby.\" \"He must be a nice husband. Do you want a lodging?\" \"I have no money.\" \"I can let you have enough for that. There\u0027s a cheap hotel near by. I\u0027ll take you to it, and pay for your lodging, and pay for it in advance.\" \"Heaven bless you! You are indeed a friend.\" [Pg 149] \"Take my arm.\" Supported by Dan, the poor woman rose and walked to an humble tavern not far away. \"She may know something about Talbot\u0027s visit. I\u0027ll question her,\" thought Dan. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81442.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
