{"id":34414,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. AN ODD COUPLE.","content":"When Dan\u0027s excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren victory. He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in yielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted unwisely. Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as he had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against labor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory. Now Gripp would undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs. Mordaunt any further work. \"I suppose I\u0027ve acted like a fool,\" said Dan to himself, with compunction. \"My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am afraid poor mother will have to suffer. Well, there\u0027s no use crying for spilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters.\" While these thoughts were passing through Dan\u0027s mind he found himself passing the clothing [Pg 32]establishment of Jackson \u0026 Co., who were special rivals of Mr. Gripp. \"Perhaps I can get some work for mother here,\" thought Dan. \"I\u0027ll try, at any rate.\" He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk. \"Do you want something in our line to-day?\" asked the clerk, pleasantly. \"Yes, I do,\" said Dan, \"if you\u0027re giving things away; but as I\u0027ve got a note of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can\u0027t pay anything out.\" \"Your credit ought to be good,\" said the salesman, smiling, \"but we don\u0027t trust.\" \"All right,\" said Dan; \"I may as well proceed to business. My mother makes vests for amusement. Can you give her any work?\" \"I will speak to Mr. Jackson. One of our hands is sick, and if your mother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some.\" The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the proprietor. \"Has your mother any experience?\" asked the proprietor, a big man, with sandy whiskers. He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated. [Pg 33] \"Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.\" \"For whom has she been working?\" \"For Nathan Gripp.\" \"Humph! Has Gripp discharged her?\" \"No, sir; she has discharged him.\" Mr. Jackson laughed, and nodded to his salesman. He rather enjoyed this allusion to his rival. \"Then she didn\u0027t like Gripp?\" \"No, sir. He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money. He\u0027s a mean fellow.\" \"I don\u0027t admire him much myself,\" said the Englishman. \"How much now did he pay for vest-making?\" \"Twenty cents apiece.\" \"We don\u0027t pay much more ourselves. There is so much competition that we have to sell low.\" \"Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for twenty,\" said Dan. Mr. Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan: \"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?\" \"You don\u0027t look like one,\" said the boy. Mr. Jackson smiled graciously. \"Joseph,\" said he, \"have we any vests ready for making?\" [Pg 34] \"Yes, sir. We have some bundles of half a dozen each.\" \"Take this boy\u0027s name and address and give him one. My boy, we will pay your mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.\" \"You will be satisfied, sir,\" said Dan, confidently, and he left the store in excellent spirits. \"It\u0027s turned out right, after all,\" thought he; \"but I am afraid we shall miss the money old Gripp owed mother. I don\u0027t know how we are going to pay the rent to-morrow. We shall be over two dollars short unless something turns up.\" Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had happened. She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the future. It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson \u0026 Co., and the landlord would not wait. \"I wish I could think of some way of raising money,\" said Dan, putting his face between his hands and looking thoughtful. \"If you only had some jewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all right.\" \"I have nothing but my wedding-ring,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, sadly. \"You must keep that, mother. Don\u0027t part with that unless you are obliged to.\" [Pg 35] \"I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way——\" \"There must be another way. I will find another way. Just don\u0027t think of it any more, mother. When does the landlord come?\" \"Generally between twelve and one.\" \"Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in. It\u0027s only two dollars and a half we want. I ought to be able to raise two dollars and a half.\" \"That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.\" \"I wonder whether Shorty wouldn\u0027t lend it to me?\" said Dan, reflectively. \"Who is Shorty, my son?\" \"He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on Broadway, not far from Trinity Church. He has a good trade, and doesn\u0027t waste his money. Yes, I will ask Shorty.\" \"I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan.\" \"I hope so, too. He\u0027s a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he\u0027ll do it, if he can. I\u0027ll see him the first thing to-morrow morning.\" Somewhat cheered by Dan\u0027s confident tone, Mrs. Mordaunt went to sleep as early as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store. The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty\u0027s stand. [Pg 36] \"Good-morning, Dan,\" said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice. \"Good-morning, Shorty. I thought I\u0027d find you here.\" \"Yes, I begin business early.\" \"I am going to ask a favor of you,\" said Dan, abruptly. \"What is it, Dan?\" \"Our rent\u0027s due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short. I can make the fifty cents before noon. Can you lend me two dollars till I am able to pay it?\" To Dan\u0027s dismay Shorty shook his head. \"I wish I could, Dan, but there\u0027s something in the way.\" \"If you\u0027re afraid I won\u0027t pay you back, you needn\u0027t think of that. I never went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.\" \"I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven\u0027t got the money.\" \"I understand,\" said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a subterfuge. \"No, you don\u0027t understand,\" said Shorty, eagerly. \"You think what I say is a sham, but you wouldn\u0027t if you knew all.\" \"If I knew all,\" repeated Dan, surprised. \"Yes, I shall have to tell you. I didn\u0027t mean to, but I don\u0027t want you to misunderstand me. The fact[Pg 37] is, Dan,\" Shorty added, sheepishly, \"I\u0027ve got more than myself to provide for now.\" \"What? You don\u0027t mean to say?\" ejaculated Dan. \"I was married yesterday, Dan,\" said the cigar dealer, almost apologetically, \"and I\u0027ve been buying furniture, and the fact is, I haven\u0027t got a cent to spare.\" \"Of course you haven\u0027t,\" said Dan. \"I never dreamed of this. Is your wife—about your size?\" \"No, Dan, she\u0027s rather tall. There she is, crossing the street. Do you see her?\" Dan looked, and saw a tall woman, of twenty-five or thereabouts, approaching the cigar stand. She was very plain, with a large mouth and a long, aquiline nose. \"That\u0027s my wife,\" said the cigar dealer, regarding his tall partner with evident pride. \"Julia, my dear, this is my friend, Dan Mordaunt.\" \"Glad to see any friend of my husband,\" said the lady, in a deep, hoarse voice, which might have been mistaken for a man\u0027s. \"He must come and see us.\" \"So I will, thank you,\" answered Dan, surveying the female grenadier with a wondering glance. \"We live at No. — Varick street, Dan, and I shall be very glad to see you any evening.\" \"By gracious!\" said Dan to himself, \"that\u0027s the queerest match I ever heard of. She might take[Pg 38] Shorty up in her arms and carry him off. I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll beat her very often,\" and Dan smiled at the thought. The morning wore away, and at eleven o\u0027clock Dan had earned forty cents. He began to get discouraged. There didn\u0027t seem to be much prospect of raising the rent before twelve o\u0027clock. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81428.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
