{"id":34446,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVI. DAN MAKES A DISCOVERY.","content":"Dan\u0027s eyes sparkled with joy at the success of his plan. \"Now tell me,\" he said, drawing the newsboy aside to a place where they would not be overheard. \"First give me my car fare.\" \"All right. Here\u0027s a quarter. Never mind the change.\" \"You\u0027ve made a fortun\u0027 by fiddling, you have,\" said the newsboy, in surprise. \"I am not a fiddler. I am a detective.\" The newsboy whistled. \"You\u0027re a young one.\" \"Never mind that. Go ahead with your story.\" The newsboy described his following Hartley to Donovan\u0027s. Hartley went in, and he directly afterward. \"What sort of a place is it?\" asked Dan. \"It\u0027s a saloon.\" \"Perhaps he only went in for a drink,\" suggested Dan, uneasily. [Pg 261] \"No, he didn\u0027t call for nothing to drink. I saw him take out some money and give to the man and the woman.\" \"What man and what woman?\" \"They was the Donovans.\" \"How long did you stay?\" \"Ten minutes. I axed old Donovan to buy a paper, and he wouldn\u0027t. Then I sat down for a minute, makin\u0027 believe I was tired. They looked at me, but I didn\u0027t appear to be noticin\u0027 \u0027em, and they let me stay.\" \"Did you see anything of a little girl?\" asked Dan, eagerly. \"Yes, there was a little gal came in. The woman called her Katy.\" Dan\u0027s spirits sank. It was Mrs. Donovan\u0027s daughter, he feared, not the child he was seeking. \"How did she look? How old was she?\" \"About five or six years old.\" He added a description of the little girl which quite revived Dan\u0027s hopes, for it answered in every respect to Althea. \"Did you hear the little girl say anything?\" \"Yes, she told her mother she wanted to see Dan.\" Dan\u0027s eyes glistened. It was Althea, after all. \"It\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"You needn\u0027t tell me any more. You\u0027re a trump.\" \"Have you found out what you want to know?\" [Pg 262] \"Yes. Have you anything to do for the next two hours?\" \"No.\" \"Then I\u0027ll pay you another dollar to go to the place with me. I think I could find it myself, but I can\u0027t take any chances. And don\u0027t say a word about what you have seen.\" \"I won\u0027t. Is this little gal your sister?\" \"She is my adopted sister, and she has been stolen from us.\" \"Then I\u0027d be willing to help you for nothing. I\u0027ve got a little sister about her size. If anybody stole her, I\u0027d mash him!\" \"Come along, then.\" The two boys boarded a car, and in forty minutes got out. \"That\u0027s the place,\" said the newsboy, pointing out Donovan\u0027s, only a few rods away. \"All right. You\u0027d better leave me now, or you may be remembered, and that would lead them to suspect me. Here\u0027s your money, and thank you.\" \"I hope you\u0027ll find your sister.\" \"Thank you. If I do, it\u0027ll be through your help.\" Dan did not at once enter Donovan\u0027s. He stopped in the street, and began to sing \"Viva Garibaldi.\" Two or three boys gathered about him, and finally a[Pg 263] couple of men. One of them handed him a three-cent piece. \"Grazio, signor,\" said Dan, pulling off his hat. \"What part of Italy do you come from?\" asked one of the men. \"Si, signor, I come from Italy,\" answered Dan, not considering it prudent to understand too well. \"Oh, he don\u0027t understand you. Come along.\" \"His hair doesn\u0027t look like that of most Italians.\" \"Pooh! I\u0027d know him for an Italian boy anywhere.\" At this moment the door of the saloon opened, and Dan, putting his violin under his arm, entered.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81460.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
