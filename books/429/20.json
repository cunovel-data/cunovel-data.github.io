{"id":34430,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. LAYING THE TRAIN.","content":"Very early the next morning Dan rang the bell at Mr. Rogers\u0027 residence. \"Can I see Mr. Rogers?\" he asked. \"The master won\u0027t be up for an hour,\" said the servant. \"Tell him Dan wishes to see him on business of importance.\" The girl shrugged her shoulders. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll see you. He was up late last night,\" she said. \"Never mind. Let him know I am here.\" \"It\u0027s very important you make yourself,\" said Susan, crossly. \"I am a person of great importance,\" said Dan, smiling. \"Mr. Rogers will see me, you\u0027ll find.\" Two minutes later Susan descended the stairs a little bewildered. \"You\u0027re to walk into the parlor,\" she said. \"Master\u0027ll be down directly.\" Dan did not have long to wait. Mr. Rogers came[Pg 155] down stairs almost directly in dressing-gown and slippers. \"Well, Dan, what is it?\" he asked. \"The store is to be broken open to-night and the safe robbed!\" said Dan. \"Good heavens! By whom?\" \"By two men living in Houston street—at least, one lives there.\" \"Have you any more to tell?\" \"Yes, sir; they are employed by Mr. Talbot.\" Mr. Rogers started. \"Are you sure of this?\" he asked. \"Quite sure.\" \"How did you find out?\" \"Partly by accident, sir.\" \"Go on. Tell me all.\" Dan rehearsed the story, already familiar to our readers, combining with it some further information he had drawn from the woman. \"I didn\u0027t think Talbot capable of this,\" said Mr. Rogers. \"He has been in our employ for ten years. I don\u0027t like to think of his treachery, but, unhappily, there is no reason to doubt it. Now, Dan, what is your advice?\" \"I am afraid my advice wouldn\u0027t be worth much, Mr. Rogers,\" said Dan, modestly. \"I am not sure of that. I am indebted to you for[Pg 156] this important discovery. You are keen and ready-witted. I won\u0027t promise to follow your advice, but I should like to hear it.\" \"Then, sir, I will ask you a question. Do you want to prevent the robbery, or to catch the men in the act?\" \"I wish to catch the burglars in the act.\" \"Then, sir, can you stay away from the store to-day?\" \"Why?\" \"Your looks might betray your suspicions.\" \"There is something in that. But how can I take measures to guard against loss?\" \"You can act through me, sir. Is there much money in the safe?\" \"No; but Talbot is authorized to sign checks. He will draw money if I am not at the store.\" \"Will he place it in the safe?\" \"Probably.\" \"Then let him do so. He is to tell the burglars the combination. He will get it from the janitor.\" \"The scoundrel!\" \"I will see the janitor, and ask him to give the book-keeper the wrong word.\" \"What else?\" \"I will secretly notify the police, whom he will admit and hide till the time comes.\" [Pg 157] \"That is well planned.\" \"Then,\" continued Dan, flushing with excitement, \"we\u0027ll wait till the burglars come, and let them begin work on the safe. While they are at work, we will nab them.\" \"You say we.\" \"Yes, sir; I want to be there.\" \"There may be danger.\" \"I\u0027ll risk it, sir.\" \"Dan, you are a brave boy.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that, sir. But if anything is going on to-night, I want to be in it.\" \"You shall, but be prudent. I don\u0027t want you to be hurt.\" \"Thank you, sir. If Mr. Talbot sends me with a large check to the bank, what shall I do?\" \"Take it.\" \"He may make off with the money during the day.\" \"I will set another detective to watch him, and have him arrested in that event.\" \"This is going to be an exciting day,\" said Dan to himself, as he set out for the store.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81444.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
