{"id":34448,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII. UNPLEASANT QUARTERS.","content":"Donovan\u0027s red face turned fairly purple with rage. \"Well, I\u0027ll be blowed!\" he said, adding an oath or two. \"You\u0027re a bold little pup! You dare to insult me! Why, I could crush you with my little finger.\" \"I have not insulted you,\" said Dan. \"I have only come for my sister.\" \"I don\u0027t know anything about your sister. So you can go about your business.\" \"That little girl is my adopted sister,\" said Dan, pointing to Althea. \"Ask her if she doesn\u0027t know me.\" \"That is my daughter, Katy Donovan,\" said the saloon keeper. \"No, I am not,\" said Althea, beginning to cry. \"I want to go away with my brother Dan.\" \"Shut up, you little jade!\" said Donovan, roughly. \"Mrs. Donovan,\" (by this time she was on her feet, looking on in a dazed sort of way), \"is not this our little Katy?\" \"Shure it is,\" she answered. [Pg 269] \"You see, young man, you\u0027re mistaken. You can leave,\" and Donovan waved his hand triumphantly. \"That\u0027s too thin, Mrs. Donovan!\" said Dan, provoked. \"That don\u0027t go down. I can bring plenty of proof that Althea was until a week since living with my mother.\" \"That for your proof!\" said Donovan, contemptuously snapping his fingers. \"I know who stole her, and who brought her to this house,\" continued Dan. Donovan started. The boy knew more than he had expected. \"The same man has been here to-day,\" added Dan. \"You lie!\" retorted Donovan, but he looked uneasy. \"You know that I tell the truth. How much does he pay you for taking care of the girl?\" \"Enough of this!\" roared the saloon keeper. \"I can\u0027t waste my time talkin\u0027 wid you. Will you clear out now?\" \"No, I won\u0027t, unless Althea goes with me,\" said Dan, firmly. \"You won\u0027t, then! We\u0027ll see about that,\" and Donovan, making a rush, seized Dan in his arms, and carried him down stairs, despite our hero\u0027s resistance. \"I\u0027ll tache you to come here insultin\u0027 your betters!\" he exclaimed. [Pg 270] Dan struggled to get away, but though a strong boy, he was not a match for a powerful man, and could not effect his deliverance. The Irishman already referred to was still upon the settee. \"What\u0027s up, Donovan?\" he asked, as the saloon-keeper appeared with his burden. \"What\u0027s the lad been doin\u0027?\" \"What\u0027s he been doin\u0027, is it? He\u0027s been insultin\u0027 me to my face—that\u0027s what the Donovans won\u0027t stand. Open the trap-door, Barney.\" \"What for?\" \"Don\u0027t trouble me wid your questions, but do as I tell you. You shall know afterward.\" Not quite willingly, but reluctant to offend Donovan, who gave him credit for the drinks, Barney raised a trap-door leading to the cellar below. There was a ladder for the convenience of those wishing to ascend and descend, but Donovan was not disposed to use much ceremony with the boy who had offended him. He dropped him through the opening, Dan by good luck falling on his feet. \"That\u0027s the best place for you, you young meddler!\" he said. \"You\u0027ll find it mighty comfortable, and I wish you much joy. I won\u0027t charge you no rint, and that\u0027s an object in these hard times—eh, Barney?\" \"To be sure it is,\" said Barney; \"but all the same,[Pg 271] Donovan, I\u0027d rather pay rint up stairs, if I had my choice!\" \"He hasn\u0027t the choice,\" said Donovan triumphantly. \"Good-by to you!\" and he let the trap fall. \"What\u0027s it all about now, Donovan?\" asked Barney. \"He wanted to shtale my Katy,\" said Donovan. \"What, right before your face?\" asked Barney, puzzled. \"Yes, shure! What\u0027ll you take to drink?\" asked Donovan, not caring to go into particulars. Barney indicated his choice with alacrity, and, after drinking, was hardly in a condition to pursue his inquiries. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81462.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
