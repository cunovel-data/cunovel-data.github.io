{"id":34415,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. EFFECTING A LOAN.","content":"As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty cents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt like many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on hand to pay it. Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men have friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan\u0027s friends were quite as poor as himself. One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy, had the reputation of being more saving than his companions. It was known that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the street boys he was considered wealthy. \"Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him,\" thought Dan, as Dick passed him on his way to Canal street. \"I say, Dick,\" said Dan, \"stop a minute. I want to speak to you.\" \"Go ahead, Dan.\" \"I want you to lend me two dollars. Our rent is due, and I can raise it all but that.\" Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when[Pg 40] Dan said hurriedly, for he felt that it was his last chance: \"You needn\u0027t be afraid of me, Dick; I\u0027ll pay you sure, and give you more interest, too, than you get in the bank.\" \"I haven\u0027t got any money in the bank, Dan.\" \"You had last week,\" said Dan, suspiciously. \"So I had, but I haven\u0027t now.\" \"You don\u0027t want to lend—that\u0027s what\u0027s the matter.\" \"You are mistaken, Dan. I\u0027m not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I have lent my money already.\" \"Who to?\" asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by plenty of greater age and better experience than himself. \"Of course it isn\u0027t any of my business,\" he added, \"if you don\u0027t want to tell.\" \"I don\u0027t mind telling you, Dan. I\u0027ve lent it to my aunt. She\u0027s got two children, and a hard time to get along. Perhaps I shall never see it again, but I couldn\u0027t refuse her.\" \"Of course you couldn\u0027t,\" said Dan, heartily. \"You\u0027ve done right, and you won\u0027t be sorry for it. I wish I knew some way of making two dollars before twelve o\u0027clock.\" \"Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?\" asked a pleasant voice. [Pg 41] Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first chapter. \"Yes, sir,\" he answered. \"I want it the worst way.\" \"Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?\" \"No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this noon.\" \"How much is it?\" \"Six dollars, sir.\" \"I thought you said you wanted to borrow two dollars.\" \"I\u0027ve got four dollars toward it, sir.\" \"Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?\" \"No, sir; this is the first time in two years.\" \"How do you account for it? Has business been duller than usual during the last month?\" \"Yes, sir, I think it has. There hasn\u0027t been as much news in the papers, and my sales have fallen off. There\u0027s another thing, too.\" \"What is that?\" \"Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can\u0027t collect it.\" \"Is it for making vests?\" \"Yes, sir. Mr. Gripp won\u0027t pay till she has made a full dozen.\" [Pg 42] \"That seems inconsiderate.\" \"Oh, he\u0027s a mean fellow.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to buy the debt of you.\" \"I wish you would, sir,\" said Dan, eagerly. \"That would leave only sixty cents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o\u0027clock, it\u0027s likely.\" \"It is only half-past eleven. To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend you five dollars, and help you collect your mother\u0027s bill.\" \"You are very kind, sir,\" said Dan, surprised and grateful; \"but I don\u0027t need so much.\" \"You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.\" \"Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?\" \"That thought won\u0027t keep me awake nights,\" said the gentleman, laughing. \"You sha\u0027n\u0027t lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that,\" said Dan, earnestly. \"Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a business-like way.\" \"All right, sir.\" Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a pleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of the days before his father\u0027s failure. \"I wish I could live so again,\" he thought. \"I don\u0027t like a tenement-house.\" [Pg 43] Mr. Grant—for this was his name—took writing materials from his valise, and seated himself at a table. \"I am going to draw up a note for you to sign,\" he said. \"I probably understand better than you the necessary form.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan the following form of acknowledgment: \"New York, Sept. 15, 18—. \"For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five dollars on demand with interest.\" \"Now,\" said Mr. Grant, \"put your name at the bottom.\" Dan did so. \"I added \u0027with interest,\u0027 but only as a form; I shall require none.\" \"I would rather pay it, sir.\" \"That may be as you please. How much will six per cent. interest make it amount to in a year?\" \"Five dollars and thirty cents,\" answered Dan, promptly. \"Good! I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.\" \"I have ciphered through cube root,\" said Dan, with some pride. \"I am not sure whether I [Pg 44]remember that now, but I could do any sum in square root.\" \"It is a pity you could not have remained in school.\" \"I should like to; but it\u0027s no use crying for spilt milk.\" \"As long as you didn\u0027t spill it yourself,\" added Mr. Grant. \"No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school.\" Mr. Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet. \"The next thing is to hand you the money,\" he said. \"Shall I give you a five-dollar bill, or small bills?\" \"Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient.\" Mr. Grant placed in Dan\u0027s hands two two-dollar bills and a one. \"One thing more,\" he said. \"Give me an order on Mr. Gripp for the money due your mother. It is as well to have it in your own handwriting. I won\u0027t tell you how to write it. See if you can find a way.\" Dan wrote an order, which Mr. Grant pronounced satisfactory. \"On the whole,\" said he, \"I believe I will take you with me when I call upon Mr. Gripp. Can you call here at three o\u0027clock this afternoon?\" [Pg 45] \"Yes, sir.\" \"That is settled, then. We will see whether Mr. Gripp will be any more polite to me than he was to you.\" \"He will be surprised to see me in your company,\" said Dan, laughing. \"It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan. A surprise often leads to victory. When does your landlord call for his rent?\" \"Between twelve and one.\" \"Then I won\u0027t detain you longer. Remember your appointment at three.\" \"I won\u0027t forget it, sir.\" \"Well, I\u0027m in luck!\" said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street. \"Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum? He\u0027s a trump, and no mistake. Now, if I could only sell the four papers I have left before twelve o\u0027clock. I don\u0027t want to get stuck on them.\" Fortune was not tired of favoring Dan. In ten minutes he had sold his papers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was awaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81429.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
