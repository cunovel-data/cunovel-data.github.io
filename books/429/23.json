{"id":34433,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.","content":"In the house on Houston street, Bill wasted little regret on the absence of his wife and child. Neither did he trouble himself to speculate as to where she had gone. \"I\u0027m better without her,\" he said to his confederate, Mike. \"She\u0027s always a-whinin\u0027 and complainin\u0027, Nance is. It makes me sick to see her. If I speak a rough word to her, and it stands to reason a chap can\u0027t always be soft-spoken, she begins to cry. I like to see a woman have some spirit, I do.\" \"They may have too much,\" said Mike, shrugging his shoulders. \"My missus ain\u0027t much like yours. She don\u0027t cry, she don\u0027t. If I speak rough to her, she ups with something and flings it at my head. That\u0027s her style.\" \"And what do you do?\" asked Bill, in some curiosity. \"Oh, I just leave her to get over it; that\u0027s the best way.\" \"Is it?\" said Bill, grimly. \"Why, you\u0027re not half[Pg 176] a man, you ain\u0027t. Do you want to know what I\u0027d do if a woman raised her hand against me?\" \"Well, what would you do?\" \"I\u0027d beat her till she couldn\u0027t see!\" said Bill, fiercely; and he looked as if he was quite capable of it. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Mike. \"You haven\u0027t got a wife like mine.\" \"I just wish I had. I\u0027d tame her.\" \"She ain\u0027t easy to tame.\" \"Just you take me round there some time, Mike. If she has a tantrum, turn her over to me.\" Mike did not answer. He was not as great a ruffian as Bill, and the proposal did not strike him favorably. His wife was certainly a virago, and though strong above the average, he was her superior in physical strength, but something hindered him from using it to subdue her. So he was often overmatched by the shrill-voiced vixen, who knew very well that he would not proceed to extremities. Had she been Bill\u0027s wife, she would have had to yield, or there would have been bloodshed. \"I say, Bill,\" said Mike, suddenly, \"how much did your wife hear of our plans last night?\" \"Nothing.\" \"She might.\" [Pg 177] \"If she had she would not dare to say a word,\" said Bill, carelessly. \"You don\u0027t know. Women like to use their tongues.\" \"She knows I\u0027d kill her if she betrayed me,\" said Bill. \"There ain\u0027t no use considerin\u0027 that.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad you think so. It would be awkward if the police got wind of it.\" \"They won\u0027t.\" \"What do you think of that chap that\u0027s puttin\u0027 us up to it?\" \"I don\u0027t like him, but I like his money.\" \"Five hundred dollars a-piece ain\u0027t much for the risk we run.\" \"We\u0027ll have more.\" \"How?\" \"If we don\u0027t find more in the safe, we\u0027ll bleed him when all\u0027s over. He\u0027ll be in our power.\" \"Well, Bill, you know best. You\u0027ve got a better head nor me.\" \"And a stouter heart, man. You\u0027re always afeared of something.\" It was true that Bill was the leading spirit. He was reckless and desperate, while Mike was apt to count the cost, and dwell upon the danger incurred. They had been associated more than once in unlawful undertakings; and though both had served a[Pg 178] short term of imprisonment, they had in general escaped scot-free. It was Bill who hung round the store, and who received from Talbot at the close of the afternoon the \"combination,\" which was to make the opening of the safe comparatively easy. \"It\u0027s a good thing to have a friend inside,\" he said to his confederate. \"Our money is as good as made.\" \"There\u0027ll be the janitor to dispose of,\" suggested Mike. \"Leave him to me. I\u0027ll knock him on the head.\" \"Don\u0027t kill him if you can help it, Bill. Murder has an ugly look, and they\u0027ll look out twice as sharp for a murderer as for a burglar. Besides, swingin\u0027 ain\u0027t pleasant.\" \"Never you mind. I\u0027ll only stun him a little. He can wake up when we\u0027re gone, but we\u0027ll tie him so he can\u0027t give the alarm.\" \"How cool you take things, Bill!\" \"Do I? Well, it\u0027s my business. You just leave everything to me. Obey orders, and I\u0027ll bring you out all right.\" So the day passed, and darkness came on. It was the calm before the storm. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81447.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
