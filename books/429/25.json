{"id":34435,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. THE BURGLARY.","content":"The attack was so sudden and unexpected that Bill, powerful as he was, was prostrated, and for an instant interposed no resistance. But this was not for long. \"You\u0027ll repent this, you old idiot!\" he hissed between his closed teeth, and, in spite of old Jack\u0027s efforts to keep him down, he forced his way up. At the same moment Mike, who had been momentarily dazed by the sudden attack, seized the janitor, and, between them both, old Jack\u0027s life was likely to be of a very brief tenure. But here the reinforcements appeared, and changed the aspect of the battle. One burly policeman seized Bill by the collar, while Mike was taken in hand by another, and their heavy clubs fell with merciless force on the heads of the two captives. In the new surprise Jack found himself a free man, and, holding up the lantern, cried, exultingly: \"If I am an old idiot, I\u0027ve got the better of you, you scoundrels! You\u0027ll open the safe, will you?\" Bill looked about him doggedly. It was hard for him to give in, but the fight was too unequal. [Pg 184] \"Mike,\" said he, \"this is a plant. I wish I had that cursed book-keeper here; he led us into this.\" \"Is it Mr. Talbot you mean?\" asked the janitor. \"Yes,\" answered Bill; \"he put us up to this. Curse him!\" \"No need to curse him,\" said Jack, dryly; \"he meant you to succeed.\" \"Didn\u0027t he tell you we were coming to-night?\" \"Not he.\" \"How did you find it out, then?\" asked Bill, quickly. \"Not through him. He was watched, for we suspected him. What did he promise you?\" \"Five hundred dollars apiece.\" \"Was that all?\" \"It wasn\u0027t enough; but we should have got more out of him.\" \"Before you go away with your prisoners,\" said Jack to the policeman, \"I wish to open the safe before you, to see if I am right in my suspicions. Mr. Talbot drew over ten thousand dollars from the bank to-day, and led us to think that he deposited it in the safe. I wish to ascertain, in the presence of witnesses, how much he placed there, and how much he carried away.\" \"Go ahead,\" said the oldest policeman. The janitor proceeded to open the safe. [Pg 185] \"Did we have the right combination?\" asked Bill. \"No.\" \"That cursed book-keeper deceived us, then.\" \"You are mistaken. He was himself deceived. I gave him the wrong word.\" \"Curse you, then!\" said Bill, savagely. \"Suit yourself, Mr. Burglar,\" said old Jack, indifferently. \"There\u0027s an old saying, \u0027Curses, like chickens, still come home to roost.\u0027 Your cursing won\u0027t hurt me any.\" \"If my curses don\u0027t my fists may!\" retorted Bill, with a malignant look. \"You won\u0027t have a chance to carry out your threats for some years to come, if you get your deserts,\" said Jack, by no means terrified. \"I\u0027ve only done my duty, and I\u0027m ready to do it again whenever needed.\" By this time the safe was open; all present saw the envelope of money labeled \"$12,000.\" The two burglars saw the prize which was to have rewarded their efforts and risk with a tantalizing sense of defeat. They had been so near success, only to be foiled at last, and consigned to a jail for a term of years. \"Curse the luck!\" muttered Bill, bitterly, and in his heart Mike said amen. \"Gentlemen, I will count this money before you,\" said the janitor, as he opened the parcel. [Pg 186] The count was quickly accomplished. It resulted, as my readers already know, in the discovery that, in place of twelve thousand, the parcel contained but one thousand dollars. \"Eleven thousand dollars short!\" said Jack. \"Gentlemen, will you take notice of this? Of course it is clear where the rest is gone—Talbot carried it away with him.\" \"Where is he?\" inquired one of the policemen. \"He ought to be pursued.\" \"By this time he is in custody,\" said Jack. \"Look here, old man, who engineered this thing?\" demanded Bill. \"Come here, Dan,\" said Jack, summoning our hero, who modestly stood in the background. \"Mr. Burglar, this boy is entitled to the credit of defeating you. We should have known nothing of your intentions but for Dan, the Detective.\" \"He!\" said Bill, scornfully. \"Why, I could crush him with one hand.\" \"Force is a good thing, but brains are better,\" said Jack. \"Dan here has got a better head-piece than any of us.\" \"You\u0027ve done yourself credit, boy,\" said the chief policeman. \"When I have a difficult case I\u0027ll send for you.\" [Pg 187] \"You are giving me more credit than I deserve,\" said Dan, modestly. \"If I ever get out of jail, I\u0027ll remember you,\" said Bill, scowling. \"I wouldn\u0027t have minded so much if it had been a man, but to be laid by the heels by a boy like you—that\u0027s enough to make me sick.\" \"You\u0027ve said enough, my man,\" said the policeman who had him in charge. \"Come along, will you?\" The two prisoners, escorted by their captors, made their unwilling way to the station-house. They were duly tried, and were sentenced to a ten years\u0027 term of imprisonment. As for Talbot, he tried to have it believed that he took the money found on him because he distrusted the honesty of the janitor; but this statement fell to the ground before Dan\u0027s testimony and that of Bill\u0027s wife. He, too, received a heavy sentence, and it was felt that he only got his just deserts. * * * * * * * On the morning after the events recorded above, Mr. Rogers called Dan into the counting-room. \"Dan,\" he said, \"I wish to express to you my personal obligations for the admirable manner in which you have managed the affair of this burglary.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Dan. [Pg 188] \"I am convinced that but for you I should have lost twelve thousand dollars. It would not have ruined me, to be sure, but it would have been a heavy loss.\" \"Such a loss as that would have ruined me,\" said Dan, smiling. \"So I should suppose,\" assented his employer. \"I predict, however, that the time will come when you can stand such a loss, and have something left.\" \"I hope so, sir.\" \"As there must always be a beginning, suppose you begin with that.\" Mr. Rogers had turned to his desk and written a check, which he handed to Dan. This was the way it read: No. 375. PARK NATIONAL BANK. Pay to Dan Mordaunt or order One Thousand Dollars. ($1,000.) Barton \u0026 Rogers. Dan took the check, supposing it might be for twenty dollars or so. When he saw the amount, he started in excitement and incredulity. \"One thousand dollars!\" he repeated, in bewilderment. \"Yes,\" said Mr. Rogers, smiling. \"It is a large sum for a boy like you, Dan. I hope you will invest it wisely.\" [Pg 189] \"But, sir, you don\u0027t mean all this for me?\" said Dan. \"Indeed I do. It is less than ten per cent on the money you have saved for us.\" \"How can I thank you for your kindness, sir?\" said Dan, gratefully. \"By continuing to serve us faithfully. By the way, what wages do we pay you?\" \"Six dollars a week.\" \"It is too little. From this time you will draw ten dollars.\" \"You have made me rich, Mr. Rogers,\" said Dan, gratefully. \"It is a little better than selling papers in front of the Astor House, isn\u0027t it, Dan?\" \"A good deal, sir.\" \"I hope you will continue to prosper. Now, Dan, let me give you two pieces of advice.\" \"I wish you would, sir.\" \"First, put this money in a good savings-bank, and don\u0027t draw upon it unless you are obliged to. Let it be a nest-egg.\" \"I mean to do that, sir.\" \"And next, spend a part of your earnings in improving your education. You have already had unusual advantages for a boy of your age, but you[Pg 190] should still be learning. It may help you, in a business point of view, to understand book-keeping.\" \"I will learn it, sir.\" Dan not only did this, but resumed the study of both French and German, of which he had some elementary knowledge, and advanced rapidly in all. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81449.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
