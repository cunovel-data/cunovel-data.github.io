{"id":34432,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. TALBOT\u0027S SCHEME FAILS.","content":"Talbot went into the office where he was alone. But the partition walls were of glass, and Dan managed to put himself in a position where he could see all that passed within. The book-keeper opened the package of bills, and divided them into two parcels. One he replaced in the original paper and labeled it \"$12,000.\" The other he put into another paper, and put into his own pocket. Dan saw it all, but could not distinguish the denominations of the bills assigned to the different packages. He had no doubt, however, that the smaller bills were placed in the package intended to be deposited in the safe, so that, though of apparently equal value, it really contained only about one-tenth of the money drawn from the bank. Talbot was not conscious of observation. Indeed, he was not observed, except by Dan, whose business it was to watch him. The division being made, he opened the safe and placed the package therein. [Pg 167] \"Not quite smart enough, Mr. Talbot,\" thought Dan. \"You will need more watching.\" He was anxious to communicate his discovery to the detective outside, but for some time had no opportunity. About an hour later he was sent out on an errand. He looked about him in a guarded manner till he attracted the attention of the outside detective. The latter, in answer to a slight nod, approached him carelessly. \"Well,\" he asked, \"have you any news?\" \"Yes,\" answered Dan. \"Mr. Talbot has divided the money into two packages, and one of them he has put into his own pocket.\" \"What has he done with the other?\" \"Put it into the safe.\" \"As I expected. He means to appropriate the greater part to his own use.\" \"Is there anything more for me to do?\" asked Dan. \"I don\u0027t know. Keep your eyes open. Does the book-keeper suspect that he is watched?\" \"I am sure that he doesn\u0027t.\" \"That is well.\" \"I am afraid he will get away with the money,\" said Dan, anxiously. \"I am not. Do you know whether there\u0027s any woman in the case?\" [Pg 168] \"He visits a young lady on Lexington avenue.\" \"Do you know the number?\" \"No.\" \"That is important. It is probably on her account that he wishes to become suddenly rich.\" This supposition was a correct one, as we know. It did not, however, argue unusual shrewdness on the part of the detective, since no motive is more common in such cases. Dan returned to the office promptly, and nothing of importance occurred during the remainder of the day. When Mr. Talbot was preparing to leave, he called in the janitor. \"You may lock the safe,\" he said. \"Very well, sir.\" \"By the way, you may use the word \u0027Hartford\u0027 for the combination.\" \"Very well, sir.\" \"Be particularly careful, as the safe contains a package of money—twelve thousand dollars.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t it have been better to deposit it in the bank, Mr. Talbot?\" \"Yes, but it was not till the bank closed that I decided not to use it to-day. However, it is secure in the safe,\" he added, carelessly. \"I have no doubt of that, Mr. Talbot.\" [Pg 169] Mr. Talbot put on his coat and departed. In turning a street corner, he brushed against a rough-looking man who was leaning against a lamp-post. \"I beg your pardon,\" said the book-keeper, politely. \"What did you say?\" growled Bill. \"Hartford,\" said Talbot, in a low tone. \"All right, sir. If you apologize it\u0027s all correct.\" \"They\u0027ve got the word,\" said Talbot to himself. \"Now the responsibility rests with them. Now I will go and see Virginia.\" His face flushed, and his eyes lighted up with joy, as he uttered her name. He was deeply in love, and he felt that at last he was in a position to win the consent of the object of his passion. He knew, or, rather, he suspected her to be coldly selfish, but he was infatuated. It was enough that he had fulfilled the conditions imposed upon him. In a few days he would be on his way to Europe with the lady of his love. Matters were so arranged that the loss of the twelve thousand dollars would be credited to the burglars. He would escape suspicion. If his European journey should excite a shadow of suspicion, nothing could be proved, and he could represent that he had been lucky in stock speculations, as even now he intended to represent to Miss Conway. [Pg 170] He was not afraid that she would be deeply shocked by his method of obtaining money, but he felt that it would be better not to trust her with a secret, which, if divulged, would compromise his safety. \"Is Miss Conway at home?\" he inquired. Yes, Miss Conway was at home, and she soon entered the room, smiling upon him inquiringly. \"Well,\" she said, \"have you any news to tell me?\" \"Virginia, are you ready to fulfill your promise?\" asked Talbot, eagerly. \"What promise?\" \"You know, surely.\" \"I make so many promises, you know,\" she said, fencing. \"Your promise to marry me.\" \"But there were conditions to that.\" \"Suppose that the conditions are fulfilled, Virginia?\" \"Do you really mean so?\" she asked, betraying strong interest now. \"Have you been lucky in stocks?\" \"I took your advice, Virginia. I dared everything, and I have succeeded.\" \"As you might have done before, had you listened to me. How much did you make?\" \"Ten thousand dollars—the amount you required.\" The girl\u0027s eyes sparkled. [Pg 171] \"And you will take me to Europe?\" she said. \"We will make the grand tour?\" \"As soon as you please.\" \"Then you deserve a reward.\" She stooped and pressed a kiss lightly upon his cheek. It was a mercenary kiss, but he was so much in love that he felt repaid for the wrong and wickedness he had done. It would not always be so, even if he should never be detected, but for the moment he was happy. \"Now let us form our plans,\" he said. \"Will you marry me to-morrow evening?\" \"But that gives me no time.\" \"You need no time. We will call on a clergyman, quietly, to-morrow evening, and in fifteen minutes we shall be man and wife. On Saturday a steamer leaves for Europe. We will start then.\" \"Oh, that will be nice. I can hardly believe that I shall so soon realize the dreams of years. I want to go to Paris first.\" \"Anywhere you please. Your wish shall be my law.\" \"How can you be spared from your business?\" asked Virginia, after a pause. \"I will plead ill health—anything. There will be no difficulty about that.\" [Pg 172] \"Shall I tell my aunt?\" \"No; not till you are almost ready to start.\" \"Why not?\" \"It is better that there should be no gossip about it. Besides, your aunt would probably be scandalized by our hasty marriage, and insist upon delay. That\u0027s something we should neither of us be willing to consent to.\" \"No, for it would interfere with our European trip.\" \"You consent, then, to my plans?\" \"Yes; I will give you your own way this time,\" said Virginia, smiling. \"And you will insist on having your own way ever after?\" \"Of course,\" she said; \"isn\u0027t that right?\" \"I am afraid I must consent, at any rate; but, since you are to rule, you must not be a tyrant, my darling.\" Talbot agreed to stay to dinner; indeed, it had been his intention from the first. He remained till the city clocks struck eleven, and then took leave of Miss Conway at the door. He set out for his boarding-place, his mind filled with thoughts of his coming happiness, when a hand was laid on his arm. [Pg 173] He wheeled suddenly, and his glance fell on a quiet man—the detective. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" he asked, not dreaming of the truth. \"You must come with me, Mr. Talbot,\" was the reply. \"You are suspected of robbing the firm that employs you.\" \"This is absurd nonsense!\" exclaimed Talbot, putting on a bold face, though his heart sank within him. \"I hope so; but you must accompany me, and submit to a search. If my suspicions are unfounded, I will apologize.\" \"Hands off, fellow! I believe you intend to rob me. I will give you into custody.\" The detective put a whistle to his mouth, and his summons brought a policeman. \"Take this man into custody,\" he said. \"This is an outrage!\" exclaimed Talbot; but he was very pale. \"You will be searched at the station-house, Mr. Talbot,\" said the detective. \"I hope nothing will be found to criminate you. If not, you shall go free.\" Talbot, with a swift motion, drew something from his pocket, and hurled it into the darkness. But he was observed. The detective darted after it, and brought it back. [Pg 174] \"This is what I wanted,\" he said. \"Policeman, you will bear witness that it was in Mr. Talbot\u0027s possession. I fear we shall have to detain you a considerable time, sir.\" Talbot did not utter a word. Fate had turned against him, and he was sullen and desperate. \"How did they suspect?\" he asked himself; but no answer suggested itself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2960/81446.html","bookId":429,"book":{"id":429,"title":"Dan, The Newsboy","description":"简介： Evening Telegram!
