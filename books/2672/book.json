Its pilot and passenger are best friends. One of the girls has a chance at survival. The other has lost the game before it\u0027s barely begun. \n When \"Verity\" is arrested by the Gestapo, she\u0027s sure she doesn\u0027t stand a chance. As a secret agent captured in enemy territory, she\u0027s living a spy\u0027s worst nightmare. Her Nazi interrogators give her a simple choice: reveal her mission or face a grisly execution. \n As she intricately weaves her confession, Verity uncovers her past, how she became friends with the pilot Maddie, and why she left Maddie in the wrecked fuselage of their plane. On each new scrap of paper, Verity battles for her life, confronting her views on courage, failure and her desperate hope to make it home. But will trading her secrets be enough to save her from the enemy? \n A Michael L. Printz Award Honor book that was called \"a fiendishly-plotted mind game of a novel\" in The New York Times, Code Name Verity is a visceral read of danger, resolve, and survival that shows just how far true friends will go to save each other.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/code-name-verity-code-name-verity-1.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Wein","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":46,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
