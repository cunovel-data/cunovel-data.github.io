{"id":1624,"title":"Sourcery (Discworld #5)","description":"Storyline: Sourcery (Discworld #5) When last seen, the singularly inept wizard Rincewind had fallen off the edge of the world. Now magically, he\u0027s turned up again, and this time he\u0027s brought the Luggage. But that\u0027s not all.... Once upon a time, there was an eighth son of an eighth son who was, of course, a wizard. As if that wasn\u0027t complicated enough, said wizard then had seven sons. And then he had an eighth son -- a wizard squared (that\u0027s all the math, really). Who of course, was a source of magic -- a sorcerer.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/sourcery-discworld-5.jpg","author":"Terry Pratchett","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":42,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
