I\u0027m so proud of you.\"\n \"Thanks, Mom.\"\n It\u0027s crazy time. All around us, graduates in caps and gowns are celebrating. Some with their families, some with their friends.\n \"Now, if they\u0027d have just allowed you to wear something other than black.\"\n I ease away from her hold. \"Mom-\"\n \"It\u0027s just so drab, darling.\" She lowers her voice. \"And Kevin was watching.\"\n \"You think Kevin would prefer me in...pink, purple?\"\n She lifts one perfectly penciled brow. \"Don\u0027t be a shit, darling.\"\n I laugh. At just that moment, my father, Kevin and his parents join us. Mr. and Mrs. Stanfield are pretty much a carbon copy of my parents. Tan, toned, aging beautifully, dressed in tailored pastels. It\u0027s the world I grew up in, and honestly-and sadly-the world I feel most comfortable in. But I try as best I can to venture out and be bad. I think I\u0027ve succeeded a few times.\n My dad scoops me up in his arms and swings me around like I\u0027m six. \"My little college graduate.\" He places me down and glances over at the Stanfields. \"They grow up so fast. Leave the nest and fly off for parts unknown.\"\n I laugh. \"Dad, I\u0027m not flying off. Not until I find a job that sends me places.\"\n \"A job,\" my mother says, clucking her tongue and fingering her pearls. \"You don\u0027t have to worry about that.\"\n \"I\u0027m not worried,\" I lie. \"I\u0027m ready.\"\n My mother\u0027s steely gaze drifts over to Kevin, who is looking at me with soft affection. I cringe. The last thing in the world I want is another date with The Tongue.\n \"You know, I was already married with a baby on the way when I was your age, Lisa.\" My mother touches the sleeve of Kevin\u0027s ultra-pressed white shirt. \"Do you like children, Kevin?\"\n He looks momentarily startled, so his mother answers for him. \"Adores them.\"\n Oh, Jesus. I need to get to an after-party, like now. Before they start planning our wedding.\n \"Brunch at the Biltmore, Meredith?\" my father asks.\n She nods. \"Yes. We have reservations for one o\u0027clock.\"\n \"Then we\u0027d better get going.\" My father turns to me. \"Why don\u0027t you ride with Kevin, honey? We old folk like to stick together.\" He gives me a wink.\n Real subtle, Dad.\n \"I brought the Porsche today,\" Kevin says, moving closer to me. \"I remember you how much you like it. The seats especially.\" His eyebrows drift up and down a couple times in an effort to be provocative.\n Real subtle, Kev.\n He tries to put his arm around me, but I feint right. I seriously can\u0027t bear him touching me again. Just the memory of his tongue coming at me like a knight\u0027s lance, ready to do battle. BARF.\n He\u0027s so not deterred. \"After brunch we can take it for a ride on the beach. I know a strip of sand that\u0027s totally abandoned. Maybe there\u0027s a few animals around, but I can get them out of my way. Permanently, if you know what I mean.\"\n I do. I really do. I stare at his shirt and all the buttons. I really do hate buttons.\n \"Hey, girl!\" Someone jumps me from behind, then whispers in my ear, \"What\u0027s up, whore?\"\n Oh, thank god.\n \"Addy, where have you been?\" I say, turning around to verbally flog her for not being by my side as my parents attempt to marry me off to Mega Buttons. But she\u0027s not alone. And I very much mean NOT ALONE.\n I eye the two guys dressed completely out of place for a morning graduation ceremony in Santa Barbara. Jeans and t-shirts and lots of ink. \"Hey, Rush. Vincent.\"\n Now, I knew Addison\u0027s man was coming to the ceremony, obviously, but I had not been informed that she had also invited his jerkoff friend.\n \"Well, Lisa dear,\" my mother says behind me. \"Are you going to introduce us to your...friends?\"\n Oh, yeah, sure. This won\u0027t be awkward. \"Mom, Dad, Mrs. and Mrs. Stanfield, Kevin, you know my best friend, Addison.\" I wait for the little nods between them all to cease before I continue. \"And this is her boyfriend, Rush. And this is...\" The hottest guy that ever walked the earth. No. That\u0027s not right. I\u0027m flustered. \"This is...\" The guy who once-oh, god. No, No, No... \"This is one of Rush\u0027s employees, Vincent.\" Better. But not much.\n Addison\u0027s looking at me like I\u0027m having a stroke or something. Rush is shaking hands with my parents and Mr. and Mrs. Stanfield. And Vincent, with his \u0027Suck Me Raw\u0027 t-shirt and nearly shaved skull, is just staring at Kevin like he\u0027s about to bust out laughing.\n \"You both have some nice artwork there,\" Kevin says politely, first pointing at Rush\u0027s neck, then at Vincent\u0027s sleeve tattoo-the one with pussy wagon scrawled down the forearm.\n \"Thanks, man,\" Rush says.\n \"Yeah, thanks,\" Vincent says like he means the exact opposite. \"Hey, if you\u0027re ever in Vegas, come by. I can hook you up.\"\n \"For a tattoo?\" Kevin says, surprised and slightly uncomfortable. \"Oh. Yeah, I don\u0027t know. Maybe.\"\n \"A pin-up with a skull face would look really sharp on your neck.\"\n Someone clears their throat behind me.\n \"My son will not be getting a tattoo,\" Mrs. Stanfield says sharply. \"He\u0027s a lawyer.\"\n \"Right.\" Vincent\u0027s gaze flickers to me. \"No blue ink for the blue blood.\"\n \"Lisa?\" my father begins. \"What is he talking about?\"\n I turn and death-stare at Vincent. \"I have no idea,\" I utter through gritted teeth.\n His lips drift upward. \"Yeah you do.\"\n \"V,\" Rush says under his breath. \"Don\u0027t.\"\n Vincent\u0027s gaze flickers over to Kevin, then back to me. \"Perfect. Your own kind, Lis. It\u0027s where you belong.\"\n \"Shall we go? On y va?\" my mom purrs in her I\u0027ve-been-to-Paris-more-times-than-you-can-count French accent. \"Brunch awaits.\"\n I roll my eyes. Good to know Vincent isn\u0027t the only asshole in this crowd.\n \"It was lovely to meet you all,\" my mother says. But her tone pretty much says the opposite.\n \"You too,\" Addison says quickly, giving me the most heartfelt I\u0027m-sooooooo-sorry look.\n She pulls both boys away by their offensive t-shirts, but not before Vincent gives me the biggest shit-eating grin on the planet. For one second, I stare after him. Black jeans, fine ass, broad shoulders, sleeves of tattoos, and the words Bite Me shaved into the back of his head.\n I turn back to Kevin. He\u0027s smiling at me and holding up the keys to his Porsche.\n Fuck, I hate buttons.\n The End \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-12.html","bookId":1916,"book":{"id":1916,"title":"Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2) \n Addison \n She is totally and utterly in love.
