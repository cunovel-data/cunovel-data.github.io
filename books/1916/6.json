But shit, I wasn\u0027t kidding when I said that quickie back on my bike was a tease.\\n\\n As I stalk her, passing through the kitchen I see the table all set for dinner. I know there\u0027s a kickass meal staying warm in the oven. I know because I ordered it, and told the chef who made it to be gone before I got back. I wanted her alone. Wanted to eat with her alone.\\n\\n My boot nearly collides with her bra. It\u0027s the bright pink one, no lace, all satin, and I instantly reach over and turn the oven off. Oh hell yeah, we can eat much later.\\n\\n My eyes flip up and catch her nearly at the door of my bedroom. Completely naked from the waist up, that compass rose I inked between her shoulder blades looking all sexy on her perfect back. She glances over her shoulder at me and gives me a smile. I go after her, panting dog that I am, and catch her up in my arms just inside my bedroom. She squeals, but quickly sinks into me when I press her back against the door and kiss her. God damn, her skin feels like hot satin under my fingertips. I run them up her spine and groan when she shivers. I feel the heat off her pussy against my waist, and I want her. Now. Just get her in my bed and keep her there till we\u0027re both drunk on each other. But that\u0027s not the game we\u0027re playing. And I\u0027m kinda dying to see her alone on the king size, legs spread, fingers doing what my aching dick wants to be doing.\\n\\n With a pissed-off, hungry-as-fuck groan I release her and walk away, head for the chair near the bed. \"Don\u0027t keep me waiting, Ads. I\u0027m in no goddamn mood to wait.\"\\n\\n Standing there in nothing but her tight jeans, her small waist v-ing upward to two handfuls of utter heaven, her eyes go kinda wide with surprise. Like maybe she didn\u0027t expect me to follow through on what I told her would happen when we got home. Like maybe she thinks I don\u0027t have the control. Shit, baby, I barely do.\\n\\n \"You want to see all of me, Rush?\" she asks as she unbuttons, unzips and steps out of her jeans, nice and slow. I stare. Like the pig that I am. Her body\u0027s a fucking wonderland. Yeah, I know the song is bullshit, but it applies here. It applies to her. My baby. She\u0027s just all creamy skin, and dangerous curves my fingers are dying to wrap around and manipulate. But ultimately, it\u0027s the thong, that scrap of pink fabric she\u0027s removing as I stare with my fucking tongue hanging out of my head, that really makes my dick weep.\\n\\n The thing is soaking wet.\\n\\n My mouth waters and I lean forward in my chair. She\u0027s naked now. Just the way I like her. Well, naked and on top of me, or under me, or straddling my face.\\n\\n \"Lie down, baby.\" My voice is pretty gruff, but I\u0027m running on fumes here. Don\u0027t know if I can make it through the entire peep show without coming in my pants. But hell, I\u0027m going to try.\\n\\n \"All alone?\" she asks, puffing out her lower lip enticingly.\\n\\n I nod. \"And all the way back to the pillows. But your eyes stay on me, yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Always.\" She smiles at me. Sexy and sorta innocent too. She climbs onto the bed, and very slowly starts crawling on all fours toward the pillows.\\n\\n My cock screams at me. I don\u0027t know how but the thing can see her, can see her ass and the pink, glistening lips of her pussy. It\u0027s torture. The sweetest kind around. When she turns and lies back against the pillows, her nipples are as hard as my dick, and my mouth is fucking begging me to just shut this stupid game down already. Fly at her and bury my head between her legs until tomorrow. Instead, I rip at the button of my jeans and yank my zipper down.\\n\\n Her eyes drop, and when she catches sight of my cock she licks her lips. Damn girl, why you gotta do that?\\n\\n \"Now what?\" she asks, knowing full well how insane she\u0027s making me, and loving it.\\n\\n \"Spread your legs, baby.\" My nostrils flare as I try to smell her. \"Yeah, that\u0027s right. Let your knees fall to the side. Let me see you.\"\\n\\n She does everything I ask, her eyes never leaving mine. She\u0027s bold, this girl. It\u0027s one of the many things that drive me wild about her. She\u0027s got balls, no fear, no embarrassment with me about her body or going as far as either of us want to.\\n\\n \"I want your tight, pink tits in my mouth, Addison,\" I say, letting my dick spring free, knowing come is leaking from the head and not giving a shit. \"Show me. Use your fingers and show me what my tongue would do to you.\"\\n\\n She groans as she brings her hands to her breasts, squeezing, massaging, then pulling back to pinch the tips. Fuck, I\u0027m dying here. I\u0027m trying to act cool, like a badass, but all I want to do is devour her.\\n\\n \"Now take one hand,\" I tell her a little roughly. \"And slide it down between your legs. Put two lucky fingers inside yourself and feel how wet you are.\"\\n\\n Her eyes close as she runs her hand down her flat belly to her shaved pussy. Christ. I lick my bottom lip, bite the fucker, anything to keep myself in check. I\u0027m going to be having motherfucking wet dreams for months after this. I don\u0027t want to be sitting here. I want to be licking at her, sucking on that swollen clit she\u0027s showing off.\\n\\n I watch as her middle and index fingers slide between her wet lips, then disappear into her sex. She moans and not only spreads her legs wider, but lifts her knees to her chest.\\n\\n \"Fuck, Ads,\" I breathe.\\n\\n She opens her eyes and pins me to my chair with the hottest, hungriest look ever. My heart is jacking against my chest, pre-come all over the head of my dick.\\n\\n I growl out the words. \"Now taste.\"\\n\\n She stops, her fingers so deep inside of her, it\u0027s nothing but knuckles. \"What?\" she asks breathlessly.\\n\\n \"You heard me.\" I stand up, cock out, and move to the edge of the bed. \"Take your fingers out of your pussy and put them in your mouth.\"\\n\\n I watch, insane, as she does exactly what I say. But when her fingers leave her pussy and head for her mouth, when her juices coat the rim of her hungry, waiting lips, I\u0027m done. I rip my clothes off, toss my boots at the wall so goddamn hard I\u0027m pretty sure they make a mark. Then I lean across the bed, grab Addison by the hips and yank her to me. I\u0027m on my knees just as her tight, hot pussy reaches my face. I use my thumbs to spread her wide, then lap her up like ice cream. She tastes like fucking sunshine and I devour her. I know it might be too fast or too hungry, but I can\u0027t help myself. As she writhes and humps my mouth, I suck on her clit, then flick it with my tongue. When I feel her tense, feel her getting close to coming, I ease up a little, flatten my tongue against her ridge, and just let her ride me.\\n\\n And motherfucker, she does. Crying out, crying my name, she bucks and rubs herself against my mouth and chin, and comes.\\n\\n \"Rush!\"\\n\\n \"Already here, baby.\" I\u0027m up and over her, pushing us both back on the bed. My thigh spreads her knees wider, and I slide into her tight, wet pussy and groan. She\u0027s still coming and my dick swells with the extra attention.\\n\\n Positioned deep inside of her, I balance on my elbows for a sec and look down into her sick beautiful face. Those eyes...the green one that nearly matches my own-the one that belongs to me. Seriously, this girl is mine. She\u0027s gotta be. There\u0027s no going back. Just forward.\\n\\n \"I love you, Ads. You know that right?\"\\n\\n Her eyes shift between heat and softness, and she nods. \"Course I do.\"\\n\\n \"You happy here? With me?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Always.\"\\n\\n Something stabs me in the heart, some kind of warning or fear. I don\u0027t like the two-word answers. It\u0027s so not her. Why isn\u0027t she telling me she loves me back? Again, not her. And why does she look all uncomfortable answering my questions? What the fuck...\\n\\n I groan because she\u0027s moving beneath me now, stealing my brain, bitch-slapping my concern. And well, shit, I\u0027m only human. And a dude. And her body is my goddamn wonderland.\\n\\n \"God, you feel so good,\" she utters hoarsely, raking her nails up my back. \"You make me feel so good, so happy.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s enough for me. It\u0027s something. And when she wraps her legs around my waist, I kiss her, hard and deep. Just like my thrusts. My hands get tangled in her hair, and for minutes, hours, who the fuck knows, we just pump each other and say naughty shit that makes us laugh, but gets us off, too. It goes on like that until we both come. Then, like always, we wrap ourselves around each other and stop talking altogether. Cause it\u0027s off to dreamland, folks. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-6.html","bookId":1916,"book":{"id":1916,"title":"Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2) \\n Addison \\n She is totally and utterly in love.
