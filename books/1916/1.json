{"id":88657,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Addison \"You\u0027re kidding me with all this, right?\" Lisa asks, her pointer finger tracing an imaginary Z down my body. \"All what?\" I ask with slight irritation. Lisa\u0027s crystal blue eyes, expertly rimmed in charcoal, narrow. \"The toddler-napwear-meets-prison-inmate thing you\u0027re working.\" The ocean breeze kicks my hair around my face. \"Orange is the new black, Lis.\" She looks insulted. \"That\u0027s insane. Who said that?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I think I heard it on Colbert last week.\" \"Colbert is a comedy show, Addy.\" Tired, and not up for the night out my best friend has dragged me to once again, I take a step back, lift my arms. \"Look, I see nothing wrong here. Just, you know, trying to be comfortable on a Thursday night.\" \"You look like you\u0027re headed to bed.\" \"I wish I was,\" I return with a bit of a pout, then silently amend, to Rush\u0027s bed. His big bed, cool sheets, and that hot, hot body I miss so much it hurts. I groan. \"You\u0027re losing it, Addy. You know that, right?\" I frown at her, but inside my mind I\u0027m screaming YEAH, I DO. Growing more exasperated with me by the minute, Lisa glances over her shoulder at the dozens of people coming in and out of the large Santa Barbara oceanfront house, spotlighted in moonglow and about thirty iPhone screens. I can practically feel her urgency to get in there, mix it up, flirt her sexy leather ass off with all the boys she\u0027s been crushing on at school. But I\u0027m keeping her from it. With my orange sweatpants and tear-stained t-shirt. When she turns back, she looks mutinous. \"I\u0027m just going to say one thing to you: Vegas.\" My insides go instantly hot and soft. It\u0027s a depressing feeling, but addicting and predictable. Kind of like my life has been over the past five weeks. When Rush and I chucked the past and decided to try this again, I was so happy. So excited. A second chance at a first love. But as Lisa put it, I\u0027m losing it. In the past five weeks, I\u0027ve only seen him three times, and for no more than a day or two. I have school and finals and graduation, and he has work and travel. It\u0027s like the most beautiful torture in the world, seeing him. I\u0027m on a high when I\u0027m around him. When he\u0027s gone, I crash. And I can\u0027t seem to bounce back. I\u0027m utterly and completely addicted to him. I\u0027m jealous of anything and anyone who gets to be near him, and there are actually times when I don\u0027t give a shit about graduating, about getting my marketing degree-about a job or a future. I just want to be in his atmosphere. I just want those eyes locked on mine, and those inked arms around me. Of course, I haven\u0027t told him any of this. I don\u0027t want him to think I\u0027m a loser. I don\u0027t want him to know the truth. I don\u0027t want him to walk away from me-or shit, run-because this time, it\u0027s not just love that would be lost. It\u0027d be my heart, my breath...my sanity. \"Vegas, Addy,\" Lisa repeats, her perfectly arched brows lifting expectantly. \"You owe me.\" I sigh, at her, at myself and my crazy thoughts, and stuff my hands in the pockets of my orange sweatpants. \"Come on, Lis. I paid you back for the convention a million times. Don\u0027t make me remind you-or myself-about that waxing party I helped you host.\" Her mouth twitches. \"No, sister friend. This isn\u0027t payback for the convention. This is for all the drives back and forth to the airport, the hours of listening to Rush\u0027s messages and trying to decode what he\u0027s really saying, the mornings I pull your ass out of bed and to class.\" I actually recoil. \"Seriously?\" \"Hells yeah, seriously.\" Some random guy walks by and gives Lisa a very dazzling, very appreciative smile. I don\u0027t blame him. She looks hella sexy in her tight leather pencil pants, low-cut lacy top and messy side braid. As she returns the smile, her expression curling into one of heat and promises, she waves at him. For second, I remember what it\u0027s like to flirt casually and just have a good time-act my age-and I don\u0027t miss it. Any of it. I only miss him. I inhale deep and exhale heavy. God, this is bad. I shouldn\u0027t be this obsessed, this close to the edge, over a guy. I know Rush isn\u0027t feeling this way. Or at least he doesn\u0027t act like it. When we talk or see each other, he\u0027s chill, sexy, into me, for sure. But not like this-not like me. When Lisa turns back to face me, takes in my relaxed-wear once again, she sighs. \"Look. I know you miss him, Addy. I know you\u0027re head over heels, as the kids say. I know you want to be with him every second of the day. But you\u0027re starting to fall apart.\" \"Starting?\" I say on a slightly manic laugh. Lisa remains serious. \"It\u0027s so not like you.\" \"I know.\" I shake my head. \"I\u0027ve never felt like this, Lis. Sometimes it\u0027s actually hard to breathe. It\u0027s more than just loving him, it\u0027s the fear of losing him. Just the thought of it breaks me apart inside. I don\u0027t know what to do with that.\" Her expression softens. \"I get it. I do. But you\u0027re going to have to hold back and chill out. What you\u0027re working here isn\u0027t cute, if you know what I mean. I believe the boys call it Psycho Bitch.\" \"Nice.\" But I know she\u0027s right. \"Maybe you need to take a little break from each other?\" \"No.\" The word is out of my mouth fast and impassioned. \"Date other people?\" \"Impossible.\" Lisa\u0027s lips press together in a worried frown. For a second, she just stares at me. Then she shrugs. \"Okay.\" I know that word, and that look. She\u0027s freaked out by me. Welcome to the club, sister friend. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" She shakes her head. \"No, seriously,\" I continue. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m such a mess. I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m being such a shit-tastic friend.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I love my little train wreck in orange.\" A smile tugs at her lips. I\u0027m surprised when my mouth curves upward. \"Okay. So, let\u0027s forget about my insanity and obsessive needs for a few hours. We\u0027re going to party. Hard. Loose. Wild.\" She laughs. \"Oh, Jesus.\" \"And.\" I gesture to my offending ensemble. \"Just to show you I\u0027m trying, I\u0027ll go home and change.\" Lisa shakes her head. \"No, you\u0027re fine. Actually, maybe it\u0027s better this way. Dolled up, you bring competition to the field, and you know I\u0027m good with getting all the attention. Come on, beeyotch.\" She grabs my hand and leads me through and around several small pockets of students and up the path to the front door. \"And for the record, fashion-wise, orange isn\u0027t the new anything. Except maybe a huge boner killer.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-1.html","bookId":1916,"book":{"id":1916,"title":"Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2) Addison She is totally and utterly in love.
