The guy is worse than a chick when it comes to style and color up top.\\n\\n \"And I think you\u0027re the knucklehead who came up with it,\" he continues.\\n\\n I mentally shrug. \"Could be.\"\\n\\n Vincent pulls back on the iron and flips his peepers up to meet mine. I notice he\u0027s added a second piercing to his eyebrow. \"So, what gives, man? And don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s the loooovvvve that\u0027s brought your ass to my chair-because I\u0027ve seen you turn away rock royalty when they wanted the name of some chick inked onto their skin.\"\\n\\n Discussing my private shit with anyone makes my balls shrink, so I point at my hand, aka V\u0027s work in progress. \"Can you finish?\"\\n\\n \"I just don\u0027t get it, bro,\" he continues like the deaf numbnuts he is. \"Breaking the rules for a hot piece of ass has never been your-\"\\n\\n My eyebrows jack up and I send him a look. \"Hey. Watch yourself.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t talk like that. You know, not if you want to keep your blood inside your body and all.\"\\n\\n \"Shit, bro. So hostile.\"\\n\\n \"Addison\u0027s my girl, dickhead,\" I growl. \"Not a hot piece of ass.\"\\n\\n \"I dunno, man.\" Vincent starts back in on me, moving up my thumb with his signature shade of black. \"Addison has a pretty hot ass. I mean, I\u0027ve never seen it without denim or anything, but I can imagine-\"\\n\\n \"I swear to motherfucking god-\" I start between teeth so tightly clenched my jaw protests.\\n\\n Vincent chuckles. \"Don\u0027t move. Or this \u0027I\u0027 is going to be busted. Damn, she has a long name. Good thing you got the room. Big hands.\" His mouth curls into a Hollywood grin. \"Addison likes that, I bet.\"\\n\\n The urge to send the heel of my boot into his junk is crazy strong. But you know, I don\u0027t want to bleed out from the needle he\u0027s using on me. Not when I\u0027m going to see my baby tomorrow. \"I think I need to fire your ass when we\u0027re done here.\"\\n\\n \"That what you think?\" He laughs. \"Shit, Merrick. You know you need me. Besides my obvious skills with an iron, I\u0027m the only testosterone you got around here.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s my turn to laugh. \"Get serious, man. Janie\u0027s got more T than the both of us combined.\"\\n\\n He grunts. \"Heh, heh. True that.\"\\n\\n Just sitting in the guy\u0027s dungeon-inspired room, watching him do his thing, that motherfucking perfect line work, I close up shop on the banter that just ends in me wanting to knock him into Sunday, and go silent for awhile. Which I guess opens me up to thoughts I\u0027ve been trying to tamp down lately. Like maybe why it is I\u0027ve broken my rule. The rule that states crystal fucking clear: No Names Inked Onto Skin. I mean, shit...it\u0027s like the kiss of death. Total jinx. An omen. A relationship killer. In my biz, I\u0027ve seen it a hundred times. So what am I doing? Testing? Teasing? Seeing how strong we got it?\\n\\n Or maybe...fuck me...maybe I want her to know how deep it runs for her, you know? Like she\u0027s in my goddamn blood. She\u0027s mine. Maybe I want her to see it tomorrow and say to me, Baby, put your name on my body, too. Somewhere real visible. Because I want every guy who takes a look and thinks he\u0027s got a chance with me to think again.\\n\\n \"All right, idiot,\" Vincent says, setting his iron down and mopping me up. \"You\u0027re done. She\u0027s on you forever. So basically you got a week or two before this thing crashes and burns.\"\\n\\n \"Dick.\" I look down at my thumb. Her name scripted in black. My eyes follow the lines, from A to N, and my dick goes hard. I close my eyes and breathe deep. The tent popping isn\u0027t something I want V to witness. Dude has zero filter, and I\u0027m kinda itching to knock him in the back of the head.\\n\\n \"Your girl coming this weekend?\" Vincent asks me, spreading some goop over Addison\u0027s name.\\n\\n Coming? Fuck yeah she is. Over and over until she\u0027s hoarse, and my neighbors a mile away call to complain. But I know that ain\u0027t what V means, so I just nod.\\n\\n \"You bringing her to the shop?\" he asks as he wraps up my thumb.\\n\\n \"Course.\" I\u0027m bringing her everywhere with me. Stuck to my side and my front and my mouth like super glue. It\u0027s been ten days since I\u0027ve touched her. And guess what? I know how many hours and minutes it\u0027s been too-I\u0027m just not that big of a douche to acknowledge it out loud.\\n\\n \"When?\" V asks, ripping off his gloves and pushing back toward the trash can in his roller chair.\\n\\n I shrug. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Friday night?\"\\n\\n \"No, not tomorrow night.\" My whole body gets kind of hot and bothered. Tomorrow night is my night to ask her the big question. Tomorrow night\u0027s the night I tell her she\u0027s gonna move in with me after grad. That she\u0027s gonna move to Vegas permanently, and let me take care of her because, fuck, I can\u0027t keep waking up without her. And I sure as hell can\u0027t keep imagining her back in Cali, looking all sweet and sexy, getting hit on by a bunch of beach ballers-especially those vanilla beach ballers.\\n\\n \"What about Saturday?\" Vincent continues. \"She coming in Saturday?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, what the fuck is this about?\" I stand up and give him a quick sneer. \"You crushing on my girl or is this about that Lisa chick?\"\\n\\n V goes kinda red, which makes me snicker a little in spite of my irritation with him.\\n\\n He turns away, shrugs. \"Don\u0027t know anyone named Lisa, man.\"\\n\\n I laugh. \"You ever gonna tell me what happened there?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know what you\u0027re yammering about, brother, and don\u0027t want to.\"\\n\\n Fine. I don\u0027t need to know. As long as it doesn\u0027t involve Addison, I don\u0027t give a shit what or who V does. \"Then why do you keep pressing me about bringing my girl into the shop?\"\\n\\n Vincent turns back, the red face thing gone. He\u0027s got one of those shit-eating grins the ladies seem to like, but I don\u0027t get it. \"I just want to witness the meet and greet, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Riddler, I\u0027m so glad you didn\u0027t ink my fuck off finger.\" I flip him off.\\n\\n \"You forgot, didn\u0027t you?\" When I stare blankly at him, he chuckles. \"Oh, you stupid bastard.\"\\n\\n I flip him off again and head for the door. \"Thanks for the ink, asswipe.\"\\n\\n \"Our guest, Rush,\" he calls after me. \"Or technically, your guest.\"\\n\\n A foot from the door, I slow up. My brows slam together and I glance over my shoulder. Vincent is leaning back in his chair, hands behind his head, showing off his most prized possession, his Banksy t-shirt.\\n\\n \"Wicked Ink welcomes Erica Day this weekend,\" he says. \"That ring a bell?\"\\n\\n My cock twitches and not because it\u0027s excited. How the hell hadn\u0027t I remembered this? \"Fuck.\"\\n\\n Vincent flashes me the pearlies, his black eyes going all wicked jackass-ness. \"The old girlfriend gets to meet the new girlfriend. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-2.html","bookId":1916,"book":{"id":1916,"title":"Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2) \\n Addison \\n She is totally and utterly in love.
