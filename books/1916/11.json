Brown and bubbling and sending off hella good scents. I\u0027m kind of proud of myself. Coq au Vin had sounded super difficult and majorly time consuming, and yeah, it was both those things, but I did it.\n I\u0027m just taking another quick taste, when I hear the front door open. My pulse jacks up in my throat, but I\u0027m glad he\u0027s home. And I\u0027m appreciative of the hour he\u0027s given me to cool down.\n \"You\u0027re making dinner, Ads?\"\n I turn to look at him. \"I told you I was going to.\"\n He\u0027s leaning against the counter about five feet away. \"I know, but I thought...\" His body language is wary, but his eyes are throwing off hardcore forgive-me darts. God, I\u0027m so in love with him.\n \"Did you think I\u0027d be on my way to the airport, Rush?\"\n He nods, and I hate the flash of fear in his eyes.\n \"Oh, Jesus.\" I put the spoon down and lean against the counter, too. \"I\u0027m not running from this. I fucking love you. It took us five years to get here.\"\n His eyes close and he exhales. \"Oh, Ads.\"\n When he opens them again, I continue, \"But you can\u0027t lie to me. No matter what. No matter how you think I\u0027m going to react.\" My words catch up with me and sucker punch me in the chest. I laugh softly. At myself. My silly, fearful, happy self. \"Amazing.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I learned something from this. From that asshole ex of yours. Seriously, she might be from the south or whatever, but girl needs to learn some manners.\"\n Rush pushes away from the counter and saunters over to me. And when I say \u0027saunters,\u0027 I mean it. Boy may be scared of losing what we got, but nothing can steal his sexy.\n \"You gotta know something,\" I say when he places his hands on my hips and pins me with those jade-green eyes. \"And if it sends you running out the door, then fine, I get that. Of course, this is your house so maybe I\u0027m the one who leaves, or you step out for a walk and...\"\n His hands tighten around my hips and he eases me closer. \"Ads. Talk to me. I\u0027m not going anywhere.\"\n I take a breath, bite my lower lip. \"Okay. Here goes. So, I\u0027ve been in hell for five weeks.\"\n His body goes rigid. \"What?\"\n \"Except when I\u0027m with you,\" I amend quickly. \"When I\u0027m with you I\u0027m crazy happy. Like, nuts happy. Like I can breathe and chill and focus. But when I\u0027m back there, when I\u0027m home, without you, life just completely sucks. Seriously, it\u0027s orange sweatpants and sad movies, pining all night instead of studying, and being an utterly craptastic friend. I\u0027m lost.\" I shrug. \"I\u0027m addicted. To you. To us.\"\n \"See, that\u0027s the problem, baby,\" Rush says casually, like all the shit I just said was completely and totally understandable.\n \"What?\" I ask. I think my Coq au Vin might be burning. And I think I don\u0027t care.\n \"Cali\u0027s not your home.\"\n I swallow. No. Definitely don\u0027t care about the fancy French chicken. \"It\u0027s not?\"\n He shakes his head. \"Come on, Addison. We\u0027re both shit without each other. Phone\u0027s not going to do it. Text just pisses me off. And weekends are a goddamn tease.\"\n I nod, laugh. \"I know, totally.\"\n He pulls back a second, his brows slamming together. He looks so hot when he\u0027s confused. \"Wait a minute. Did you actually think I\u0027d be freaked out or turned off by hearing how sick your love for me is?\"\n \"Yeah. I kinda did.\" I shake my head. \"That abandonment thing runs deep, you know? And when you find that person who just drives you crazy in the freaking best way, like they get you, and all you want to do is be with them, you get scared. You get scared \u0027cause you wanna hang on tight. Crazy tight. And you wonder if you\u0027ll suffocate them and they\u0027ll break away and haul ass to a different state or country or...the moon.\" I start laughing at myself. I\u0027m such a nutjob.\n Rush pulls me in for a kiss. It\u0027s not the hungry, I\u0027m-going-to-fuck-the-shit-out-of-you kind, which is pretty standard for us because we\u0027re horny and in love. It\u0027s gentle and vulnerable, and it makes tears prick in my eyes.\n When he pulls away, there\u0027s something near my cheek. I can\u0027t see it because it\u0027s out of my eyeline, but I think it\u0027s metal. Then he brings it around and holds it between us.\n \"Move in and suffocate the shit out of me, Ads. And before you say anything, that\u0027s not a question.\" He takes the key and heads for the top of my tank. I gasp when he places the cool metal between my breasts. His eyes lift to hold mine. \"I was going for your heart, but I\u0027m not that skilled in the romantic notions department.\"\n I wrap my arms around his neck and get as close as possible. \"Oh, I think you\u0027re pretty good.\"\n \"And I think you\u0027re pretty.\"\n I giggle like a girl. \"Maybe we should turn off the stove?\"\n \"Definitely.\"\n He flips the switch in one easy movement, then hauls me into his arms and kisses me again. And this time, it\u0027s totally hungry and I-want-to-fuck-the-shit-out-of-you. And you know what? We can eat later. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shattered-ink-wicked-ink-chronicles-2/page-11.html","bookId":1916,"book":{"id":1916,"title":"Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Shattered Ink (Wicked Ink Chronicles #2) \n Addison \n She is totally and utterly in love.
