{"id":2520,"title":"Alice in Zombieland (White Rabbit Chronicles #1)","description":"Storyline: Alice in Zombieland (White Rabbit Chronicles #1) She won’t rest until she’s sent every walking corpse back to its grave. Forever. Had anyone told Alice Bell that her entire life would change course between one heartbeat and the next, she would have laughed. From blissful to tragic, innocent to ruined? Please. But that’s all it took. One heartbeat. A blink, a breath, a second, and everything she knew and loved was gone. Her father was right. The monsters are real…. To avenge her family, Ali must learn to fight the undead. To survive, she must learn to trust the baddest of the bad boys, Cole Holland. But Cole has secrets of his own, and if Ali isn’t careful, those secrets might just prove to be more dangerous than the zombies…. I wish I could go back and do a thousand things differently. I\u0027d tell my sister no. I\u0027d never beg my mother to talk to my dad. I\u0027d zip my lips and swallow those hateful words. Or, barring all of that, I\u0027d hug my sister, my mom and my dad one last time. I\u0027d tell them I love them. I wish... Yeah, I wish.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/alice-in-zombieland-white-rabbit-chronicles-1.jpg","author":"Gena Showalter","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":63,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
