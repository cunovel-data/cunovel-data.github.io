Elena and Stefan had shaken the girl and poured cool water on her face, trying to wake her up without having to take her to the hospital. Blood had pooled through the bandages they\u0027d put on the girl\u0027s wounds - Damon had bitten too deeply, Stefan said - and finally Stefan had fed her blood from his own wrist, grimacing, to help her heal. He didn\u0027t feel right doing that, Elena knew: the exchange of blood was too intimate, meant love to Stefan, but what else could they do? They couldn\u0027t let her die.\n When the girl finally regained consciousness, Stefan Influenced her to forget what had happened, and he and Elena helped her back to her sorority house. By the time they\u0027d left her, near dawn, she\u0027d been flushed and giggling, sure that she\u0027d just been out too late drinking on a fabulous night.\n Back in her dorm room, Elena had tried to sleep, but she\u0027d been too worked up. She tossed and turned under her clean cotton sheets, remembering the frustration in Stefan\u0027s eyes as he told her, Damon did this, and the suppressed flash of panic she\u0027d seen when he said, We have to keep this a secret.\n She\u0027d known Damon still fed off humans, although she usually managed not to think about it. But he hadn\u0027t done any real harm, not for a long time. Now he used his Power to convince pretty girls to give him their blood willingly, and then left them with nothing but a vague memory of an evening spent with a charming and mysterious man with an Italian accent. If that. Sometimes they just had a hole in their memory.\n And, sure, it was wrong. Elena knew that, even if Damon didn\u0027t. The girls weren\u0027t in their right minds. He fed on them, and they never really understood. Elena was sure that if it happened to her, or Bonnie, or anyone she cared about, she would have been outraged and disgusted. But she\u0027d been able to ignore the facts when the end result - Damon satisfied, his victims seemingly unscathed - appeared to be so benign.\n But this time he clearly hadn\u0027t bothered to be careful with the girl, or to make it easy on her. She\u0027d been bleeding alone in the woods, and when she\u0027d finally woken, she had been screaming. Elena shuddered at the memory, sick with guilt.\n Was this the reality she\u0027d been ignoring? Maybe Damon had been attacking people all this time and hiding it from her, and the idea of the woozy, unaware, and happy victim was a lie. Or maybe there had been a change, and it was Elena\u0027s fault. Had Damon done this in a rage, because Elena had chosen Stefan?\n Elena tried once more to reach Damon, but when it rang through to voice mail, she pushed the \"end call\" button on her phone. She\u0027d been calling Damon on and off all morning and had left a couple of messages already, but he hadn\u0027t picked up or called her back.\n \"Was that Stefan?\" Bonnie asked, coming out of the bathroom toweling off her hair. Red strands curled wildly over her face in all directions. \"Is he on his way?\"\n \"Everybody should be here any minute,\" Elena answered, not correcting Bonnie\u0027s assumption. They had decided to meet today to start planning their defense against the Vitale vampires, and to try to figure out how to stop them before they could resurrect Klaus.\n And soon, everyone (except Damon) was there: Meredith sitting on her bed, gray eyes alert as she carefully sharpened a hunting knife; Matt, still looking pale, hunched over in Elena\u0027s desk chair; Bonnie and Zander cuddled together on Bonnie\u0027s bed, adorably happy with the flush of new love despite the seriousness of the situation. As Elena looked over at them, Zander murmured something in Bonnie\u0027s ear and she blushed.\n Stefan joined Elena on her bed, taking her hand in his. Still, after a year, Elena felt a jolt of excitement move from her fingertips straight to her heart. Elena stared at him for a moment, looking for some indication of how upset he\u0027d been the night before, a clue about whether he\u0027d managed to talk to Damon yet, but there was nothing.\n \"Okay, everybody,\" Meredith said, running her thumb along the sharpened blade of her knife. \"We know that Ethan is hiding - \"\n \"Wait,\" Elena said. \"There\u0027s something I need to tell all of you.\" Stefan\u0027s eyes snapped to hers, hard and bright, and she realized she had been wrong about him being calm. The secret about Damon had him tightly strung.\n \"Um,\" she said, feeling uncharacteristically nervous. She remembered how they had all felt about the cold, didactic Guardians they had met in the Dark Dimensions, the ones who had stripped her of her Powers (painfully - she couldn\u0027t forget how much it had hurt when they cut her Wings) and who had refused to bring Damon back from death. But she pushed her jaw out proudly, stubbornly, and kept going.\n \"I just found out that I\u0027m a Guardian,\" she said flatly.\n There was a blank silence.\n Finally, Zander broke it. \"A guardian of what?\" he asked tentatively, glancing to Bonnie for clarification.\n Bonnie, frowning, waved one hand in the air in a grand, encompassing gesture. \"Of everything, really,\" she said vaguely. \"If Elena means a Guardian Guardian.\" She looked at Elena for confirmation, and Elena nodded. \"They\u0027re these awful women - at least they look like women - who are meant to keep things running in the universe the way they\u0027re supposed to. I don\u0027t really understand how Elena could be one, though. They don\u0027t live here. It\u0027s an alternate-dimension kind of thing. They\u0027re not really people, I don\u0027t think.\" She turned to Elena, her face open and confused. \"What do you mean, Elena?\" she asked.\n Elena looked away from her, staring at the wall. The skin on her face felt like it was too tight, and her eyes were burning. \"James - my history professor - knew my parents when they were in college. He was really close to them,\" she told her friends, forcing herself to keep it together. \"He told me that they agreed to have a child who would be a Guardian on Earth. He said I was supposed to be trained by the Guardians when I was twelve, but my parents didn\u0027t want to hand me over.\" Her voice shook a little, and she stared very hard at the Matisse print she had hung above her bed. Pressing her shoulder against Stefan\u0027s, she took comfort in the solidity of his body next to hers, and didn\u0027t look at anyone.\n Then Meredith was next to her, and her narrow hand took hold of Elena\u0027s. In a moment, Bonnie had squeezed herself onto the bed as well and was gazing at Elena with wide, sympathetic brown eyes.\n \"We\u0027re on your side, you know that, Elena,\" Meredith said calmly, and Bonnie nodded.\n \"Velociraptor sisterhood, right?\" she said, and Elena cracked a tiny smile at their old private joke. \"If the Guardians take on one of us, they take on all of us. Even though they\u0027re pretty scary. We\u0027ll fend them off.\"\n Elena gave a short, half-hysterical laugh. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"Really. But I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way to get out of this. I don\u0027t even know what it means exactly, being a Guardian on Earth.\"\n \"Then that\u0027s the first thing to find out,\" Meredith said sensibly. \"Alaric\u0027s coming up to visit this weekend. He might know something, or at least be able to discover what the story is on Earthly Guardians.\" Meredith\u0027s more-or-less fiance, Alaric, was working on a doctorate in paranormal studies, and the various contacts he had often came in handy.\n \"We will figure something out, Elena,\" Bonnie promised.\n Elena blinked back tears. Bonnie and Meredith had drawn closer to her, shutting everyone out for a moment, even though Stefan was still strong beside her. She could always rely on the three of them coming together when one of them was threatened. They\u0027d been watching out for one another since the worst thing they had to worry about was elementary school bullies and mean teachers.\n Stefan pulled her closer against him. From their seats, Matt and Zander were watching her with almost identical expressions of sympathy and concern. Meredith was right: Elena wasn\u0027t alone. She let out a breath, and her shoulders loosened, releasing some of the misery she\u0027d been holding since James had told her the secret of her birth.\n \"I\u0027m glad Alaric\u0027s coming. And it\u0027s a good idea to ask him what he can find out. Maybe James can tell us more, too,\" Elena said. She tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, thinking. \"Actually, he\u0027d better be able to tell us something. He\u0027s known about this since before I was born. He\u0027s had about twenty years to find out something useful.\" Then she clapped her hands once, and tried to push all her fears aside. \"For now, though, we need to focus on Ethan and the vampires.\" Elena felt her old self coming back to the surface, forceful and energetic and ready to make plans.\n Stefan squeezed Elena\u0027s knee as he climbed off the bed. \"Tonight is our last chance to stop Ethan,\" he said, standing in the middle of the room and looking at them all seriously. His face was shadowed and intense, his normally leaf-green eyes dark. \"Tomorrow is the equinox, when the separation between the realms of the living and the dead is at its weakest. That\u0027s when they\u0027ll try and resurrect Klaus. Meredith, what\u0027s our weapons situation?\"\n Meredith rose, too, and opened her closet, pulling out her various bags of weapons: her special hunter\u0027s stave with its spikes of materials from silver to ash to tiny hypodermic needles, made to affect all the different creatures a hunter might fight; an assortment of knives of various sizes, from a long silver dagger to a thin, practical boot knife, all razor-sharp; staffs and throwing stars and machetes and maces and a number of things Elena couldn\u0027t even begin to guess at the names for.\n \"Wow,\" said Zander, who had rolled onto his stomach on Bonnie\u0027s bed to watch her. He looked at Meredith with new respect and a bit of trepidation. \"You\u0027re like a one-woman army.\"\n Meredith flushed slightly. \"It might be overkill,\" she said, \"but I like to be prepared.\" She pulled out a wooden trunk from her closet. \"And I have this. Alaric helped me gather it all before school started.\" She opened the box with a half-apologetic glance at Stefan, who flinched and stepped backward, away from the trunk. Elena craned to see. It looked like some kind of plant in there, filling the box to the brim.\n Oh. The box was crammed full of vervain. There was probably enough there to incapacitate a whole colony of vampires, if they could only figure out a way to rub it on them, or get them to eat it. At the very least, they\u0027d all be able to protect themselves from being Influenced.\n \"Good,\" Stefan said briskly, recovering from his instinctive reaction to the vervain. \"That should come in handy. Now, Matt, what can you tell us about the underground tunnels?\"\n Elena felt a little pulse of pride run through her as Stefan turned to Matt, quickly getting him to sketch out on paper what he remembered and what he had heard about the Vitales\u0027 safe house and network of tunnels. Stefan was nodding and asking questions, gently nudging Matt\u0027s memory, encouraging him to share even the smallest detail. Matt\u0027s eyes widened, his voice gaining strength as Stefan\u0027s questions continued, as if Matt was beginning to piece together the bigger picture in a new way.\n Stefan had changed. When he had first come to Fell\u0027s Church, he had been so quiet and distant, reluctant to make any kind of mark on the humans who surrounded him. He had felt, Elena knew, like he was diseased, like he couldn\u0027t be among mortals without spreading death and despair.\n Now he had the quality of a natural leader. As if he felt Elena\u0027s eyes on him, Stefan glanced up at her, his lips forming a small, private smile just for her. She knew this change in Stefan was due to her and to all that had happened in the past year. Surely, whatever Damon had done - even if he was sinking into violence again because of Elena - here in Stefan was something that she could be uncomplicatedly proud of?\n \"Couldn\u0027t we do something with all that vervain?\" Bonnie asked suddenly. \"Like, burn it, or make it a gas somehow and fill the tunnels with its smoke? If we blocked the other exits, all the vampires would go into the house. We could trap them and burn the house down, or at least get to all of them at once.\"\n \"That\u0027s a good idea, Bonnie,\" Stefan said. Zander agreed enthusiastically and Bonnie\u0027s face lit up with pleasure. It was funny, Elena thought, that they were all used to thinking of Bonnie as sort of the junior member of the group, the one who needed to be protected, and she really wasn\u0027t; she hadn\u0027t been for a long time.\n \"What other resources do we have?\" Stefan asked thoughtfully, pacing back and forth across the room.\n \"I could get the guys to help out,\" Zander suggested. \"We\u0027ve been after the Vitale vampires for a while. We won\u0027t be as strong as we would be if it were the right lunar phase, and not all ten of us can transition without the full moon. But we work pretty well together . . .\" His voice trailed off. \"If you want us,\" he added. \"I know you don\u0027t all feel comfortable with werewolves, and, to be honest, we\u0027re not usually big fans of vampires. No offense.\" He looked from Stefan to Meredith, who still held the knife against her leg.\n Meredith, of course, was the one most likely to object to bringing a Pack of werewolves into their group. Bonnie had assured them that Zander\u0027s Pack was different than the werewolves they\u0027d met before - that they were good, more like guard dogs than wild animals. But Meredith had been raised to hunt monsters.\n Now she nodded slowly to Zander, though, and said only, \"We can use all the help we can get.\" Bonnie and Meredith locked eyes across the room and Bonnie\u0027s lips tipped up in a tiny, satisfied smile.\n \"Speaking of \u0027all the help we can get,\u0027\" Meredith said. \"Where\u0027s Damon?\" She looked from Elena to Stefan when they didn\u0027t immediately answer. \"This is one time when we can really use him. You should call him and get him in on the plan.\" Her expression was sympathetic but determined, and Elena realized that Meredith thought they were hesitating because Elena had almost-dated Damon while she and Stefan had been apart. If only Meredith knew the truth, she thought, but she can\u0027t ever know. Stefan and I need to keep Damon safe.\n \"Maybe you could call him, Elena?\" Bonnie asked tentatively.\n Elena\u0027s and Stefan\u0027s eyes met. Stefan\u0027s face was blank and controlled again, and Elena couldn\u0027t see the tiniest crack in his armor as he cut in, smoothly and casually, \"No, I\u0027ll call Damon. I need to talk to him, anyway.\"\n Elena bit her lip and nodded. She wanted to see Damon for herself - she was desperate to see him, to know what was wrong with him, wanting to fix it - but he wasn\u0027t taking her calls. Maybe what Damon needed right now from Elena was space. She hoped that Stefan, at least, could get through to him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-4.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \n Destined for danger...
