A lot has happened to me, more than most people get to experience in a lifetime, but I still have so much to learn and do.\\n\\n But I\u0027m sure of Stefan, and I\u0027m sure about forever. All I can feel is overwhelming, riotous joy.\\n\\n It\u0027s not even just Stefan and me, and the prospect of eternity to learn all the little things we don\u0027t know about each other, even yet: What was the color of Stefan\u0027s mother\u0027s eyes? What will his lips taste like, on a bright spring morning two hundred years from now? Where would he go, if he could go anywhere? And we can go everywhere. We\u0027ll have time.\\n\\n That\u0027s so much of my happiness, but it\u0027s not all of it.\\n\\n I finally know who I am. It\u0027s ironic in a lot of ways that I should be a Guardian, when I loathed and feared them with such passion. But an Earthly Guardian is different; Andres has taught me that: I can be compassionate and loving and human, and I can use my Guardian Powers to protect my home, to protect the people I care about, to keep evil from destroying the innocent.\\n\\n There\u0027s my bond with Damon, too. Finally I know how I can care for Damon and love Stefan at the same time. There\u0027s a connection between Damon and me that\u0027ll last forever, that will keep him from being consumed by the darkness that has always threatened him. No matter where he is, I\u0027ll hold a piece of him and he\u0027ll have a piece of me.\\n\\n Through everything, Stefan will be by my side.\\n\\n And with us will be all my beloved friends, each of them so powerful and good, each in their own way. I love them all so much.\\n\\n I\u0027m trembling, but it\u0027s with anticipation. I\u0027m not afraid anymore. I can\u0027t wait to see what the future holds, for all of us. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-45.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \\n Destined for danger...
