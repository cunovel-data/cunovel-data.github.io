It felt like it had been so long since they had been alone together, so long since she\u0027d even been close enough to Stefan to touch him. All this evening she\u0027d found herself leaning against his side, brushing her thumb over his knuckles, wrapping her arm around his waist, tracing her finger along his collarbone: any little touch she could have. Anything to feel the simple, satisfying reality of Stefan, here with her at last.\\n\\n It was a pleasantly warm night, and there was soft moss underfoot. A breeze rustled the leaves of the forest trees all around them, and through the trees\u0027 branches she could glimpse a sky full of stars. It had all the elements of a romantic stroll through the woods, except for the fact that they were searching for bloodthirsty vampires.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t sense anything,\" Stefan said. His hand was reassuringly tight around hers, but his dark green eyes held a faraway look, and Elena knew he was using his Power to scan the forest. \"No vampires and no one in pain or afraid, as far as I can tell. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anyone around.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll keep looking, though. Just in case,\" Elena urged. Stefan nodded. There were limits to Stefan\u0027s searching Power: someone much stronger than he was could hide from it; someone much weaker might not catch his attention. And some creatures, like werewolves, he couldn\u0027t sense at all.\\n\\n \"I know I shouldn\u0027t be thinking about this with everything that\u0027s going on, but all I want is to be alone with you,\" Elena confessed quietly. \"Things are happening so fast. If Ethan brings Klaus back . . . it feels like we might not have much time.\"\\n\\n Stefan let go of Elena\u0027s hand and touched her face lightly, his fingers brushing over her cheeks and the curve of her eyebrow, a thumb ghosting across her lips. His eyes darkened with passion, and he smiled. Then he kissed her, softly at first.\\n\\n Oh, Elena thought, and then, yes.\\n\\n As if he\u0027d been waiting for her confirmation, Stefan\u0027s kisses became more passionate. His hand fisted gently in her hair, and they moved backward until she was pressed against a tree. The bark was rough against her bare shoulders, but Elena didn\u0027t care; she just kissed Stefan fiercely, hungrily.\\n\\n This is right, Elena thought. This is like coming home, and she felt Stefan\u0027s agreement and the strength of his love. Yes, he thought, and more.\\n\\n Their minds entwined and Elena relaxed into the slow familiar spiral of Stefan\u0027s thoughts and emotions. There was love there - solid, constant love - and there was a steady bruiselike ache of regret at the time they\u0027d lost. Strongest of all, there was a sense of joyous relief. I didn\u0027t know how I was going to live without you, Stefan thought to her. I couldn\u0027t live forever, knowing you weren\u0027t mine.\\n\\n At the thought of forever, a thrum of anxiety shot through Elena. Barring a death by violence, forever was a given for Stefan. He would go on, unaging and beautiful, always eighteen. And Elena? Would she grow old and die with Stefan eternally young by her side? She didn\u0027t doubt that he would stay with her, no matter what.\\n\\n There were other possibilities. She\u0027d been a vampire once, and she\u0027d suffered, being separated from her human friends and family, divided from the living world. She knew Stefan wouldn\u0027t wish that life on her. But it was an option, although they never talked about it.\\n\\n Her mind touched on a certain bottle tucked in the back of her closet at home, and shied away again. She\u0027d stolen a single bottle of the water of eternal life from the Guardians when she and her friends had traveled in the Dark Dimension. Its existence, and the choice it offered her, was always at the edges of her mind. But she wasn\u0027t ready to make that decision, to end her mortal life. Not yet.\\n\\n She was still growing, still changing. Was the person Elena was now really the person she wanted to be for the rest of her life? She was so flawed, so unfinished. Drinking the water of eternal life, or becoming a vampire, would close doors Elena wasn\u0027t ready to shut yet. She wanted to stay human. She ached inside at that: Would she be human now? Could she be human, if she had to become a Guardian?\\n\\n All of this she considered in a private corner of her mind while most of her was focusing on the sweet sensations of Stefan\u0027s lips and body against hers and the steady thread of love passing between them. Enough of her emotions must have broken through to Stefan, though, that he responded. Whatever you want, Elena, he thought to her, gentle and reassuring. I\u0027ll be with you. Forever. However long that might be for you.\\n\\n She knew that meant Stefan would understand even if she decided to live a natural life, to grow old and die. And there would be reasons to do that. Stefan and Damon had both lost something by never aging, never changing. They sensed that part of their humanity was gone.\\n\\n But how could she face someday abandoning Stefan? She couldn\u0027t imagine dying again, dying and leaving him behind. Elena pressed her back more firmly against the rough bark of the tree and kissed Stefan harder, feeling more fiercely alive with the almost-painful contrast of sensations.\\n\\n Then she pulled back. She\u0027d kept so much from Stefan since she\u0027d come to Dalcrest. She wasn\u0027t going to go down that path again, wasn\u0027t going to love him while locking him out of parts of her life.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something I have to tell you,\" she said. \"You need to know everything. I can\u0027t - I can\u0027t hide things from you, not now.\" Stefan frowned questioningly, and she dropped her gaze to her hand against his shirt as she twisted the fabric nervously. \"James told me something yesterday, before the fight,\" she blurted. \"I\u0027m not who I thought I was, not exactly. The Guardians chose my parents - they made me - and my parents were supposed to hand me over when I was twelve to become a Guardian. My parents refused and that was why they died. It wasn\u0027t just a random accident. The Guardians killed them. And now after learning this, I\u0027m supposed to become one of them?\"\\n\\n Stefan looked flabbergasted for a moment, and then his face filled with sympathy. \"Oh, Elena,\" he said, and pulled her close again, trying now to comfort her.\\n\\n Elena let herself relax against his chest. Thank God Stefan understood that the idea of becoming one of the Guardians, those cold regulators of order, was nothing to celebrate, even if it would bring her Power.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll help you,\" Stefan said. \"If you want to try to bargain your way out of it, or fight this, or go through with it. Whatever you want.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Elena said, her voice muffled as she pressed her face into his shoulder.\\n\\n Suddenly, she felt Stefan\u0027s body tense against hers and realized he was looking around. \"Stefan?\" she asked.\\n\\n He was looking off into the distance over her head, his mouth tight and eyes alert. \"I\u0027m sorry, Elena,\" he said as Elena pulled away and met his gaze. \"We\u0027ll have to talk about this later. I just felt something. Someone in pain. And now that the wind has changed, I think I smell blood.\"\\n\\n Elena tamped down her emotions, forcing herself back into calm rationality. All of this, all her own problems and questions, could wait. They had a job to do. \"Where?\" she asked.\\n\\n Stefan took Elena\u0027s hand and led her farther into the undergrowth. The trees blocked out more of the stars here, and she stumbled over roots and stones in the darkness. Stefan steadied her, guiding their way.\\n\\n A moment later, they burst into another clearing. It took Elena\u0027s eyes a second to adjust, to see the dark shape Stefan was already moving toward cautiously. Huddled on the ground lay the body of a human.\\n\\n They dropped to their knees beside it, and Stefan reached out and carefully, gently turned the person over. The body flopped heavily onto its back. A girl, Elena realized. A girl about her own age, her face pale and empty. Golden hair shone in the starlight. There was blood on her throat.\\n\\n \"Is she dead?\" she asked in a whisper. The girl was so still.\\n\\n Stefan touched the girl\u0027s cheek, then carefully ran his fingers across her neck, below the trickle of blood, not touching the thick red fluid. \"Not dead,\" he said, and Elena let out a sigh of relief. \"But she\u0027s lost a lot of blood.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027d better get her back to campus,\" Elena said. \"And we\u0027ll tell the others the vampires are hunting in the woods. We can come back and find who did this.\"\\n\\n Stefan was staring down at the girl\u0027s wounds, his mouth oddly twisted in an unreadable expression. \"Elena, I - I don\u0027t think this was Ethan\u0027s vampires,\" he said hesitantly.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" Elena asked, puzzled. A root was digging into her knees, and she shifted to get more comfortable, pressing one hand against the cold ground. \"What else would have done this?\"\\n\\n Stefan frowned and gently touched the girl\u0027s neck again, still careful not to come into contact with the blood. \"Look at the marks,\" he said. \"The vampire who did this was angry and careless, but he was experienced. The bite is clean and in the perfect place to get the maximum amount of blood without killing the victim.\" He smoothed the girl\u0027s hair carefully, as if to comfort her. He looked like he was in pain, his teeth clenched, his eyes narrow. \"Elena, Damon did this,\" he said.\\n\\n Everything in Elena tightened and she shook her head, her hair whipping around her. \"No,\" she said. \"He wouldn\u0027t just leave someone in the woods to die.\"\\n\\n Stefan had a far-off look on his face and she instinctively reached out to touch his arm, trying to comfort him. He closed his eyes for a second and leaned into her. \"After five hundred years, I can recognize Damon\u0027s bite,\" he said sadly. \"Sometimes it seems like he\u0027s changed, but Damon doesn\u0027t change.\" The weight of Stefan\u0027s words seemed to hit him just as strongly as they hit Elena, and he hunched his shoulders.\\n\\n For a moment, Elena couldn\u0027t breathe, and she gulped, feeling dizzy and sick. Damon? Images flashed in her mind\u0027s eye: Damon\u0027s fathomless, dark eyes hot with fury, sharp with bitterness. And softer, warmer sometimes, when he looked at her or at Stefan. A hard kernel of denial formed in her chest.\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, and looking at Stefan, she repeated it more firmly. \"No. Damon\u0027s hurting, because of us - because of me.\" Stefan nodded almost imperceptibly. \"We\u0027re not going to give up on him. He has changed, he\u0027s done so much for us, for all of us. He cares, Stefan, and we can pull him back from this. He didn\u0027t kill her. It\u0027s not too late.\"\\n\\n Stefan was listening to her carefully and after a moment he drew his hand wearily across his face, his features firming with resolve. \"We have to keep this a secret,\" he said. \"Meredith and the others can\u0027t know what Damon\u0027s done.\"\\n\\n Elena remembered Meredith\u0027s expression as she wielded her stave, and swallowed hard. The hunter in Meredith wouldn\u0027t hesitate to kill Damon if she thought he was a real danger to innocent humans. \"You\u0027re right,\" she said thinly. \"We can\u0027t tell anyone.\"\\n\\n Reaching across the body of unconscious girl, Stefan took Elena\u0027s hand in his again. She clasped his hand tightly, her eyes meeting his in a silent pledge. They would work together; they would save Damon. It was going to be all right.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-3.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \\n Destined for danger...
