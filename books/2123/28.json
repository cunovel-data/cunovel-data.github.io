{"id":100829,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Bonnie was padding across campus in bare feet, her ice-cream-cone pajama bottoms flapping around her ankles. Oh, great, she thought dismally. I forgot to get dressed again.\n \"Are you ready for the test?\" Meredith said brightly next to her. Bonnie stopped and stared at her suspiciously.\n \"What test?\" she asked. \"We don\u0027t have any classes together, do we?\"\n \"Oh, Bonnie,\" Meredith said, sighing. \"Don\u0027t you even read your email? There was some kind of mix-up, it turns out, and we all have to pass a big high-school Spanish exam we missed, or we won\u0027t really have graduated.\"\n Bonnie stared at her, frozen in horror. \"But I took French,\" she said.\n \"Well, yeah,\" Meredith said. \"That\u0027s why you should have been studying all this time. Come on, we\u0027re going to be late.\" She broke into a swift-footed run, and Bonnie stumbled after her, tripping over the laces of her Converse high-tops.\n Wait a second, she thought. Wasn\u0027t I barefoot a minute ago?\n \"Hang on, Meredith,\" she said, drawing to a halt to catch her breath. \"I think this is a dream.\" Meredith ran on, though, straight and sure down the path, her long, dark hair flying out in the wind as she left Bonnie behind.\n Definitely a dream, Bonnie thought. In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve had this dream before. \"I hate this dream,\" she muttered.\n She tried to remember the conscious-dreaming techniques she\u0027d been talking about with Alaric. This is a dream, she told herself fiercely. Nothing is real and I can change whatever I want. Glancing down at herself, she made her sneakers tie themselves and changed her pajamas into skinny blue jeans and a black top. \"Better,\" she said. \"Okay, forget the exam. I think I want . . .\" Possibilities were flying through her mind, but then she forgot them all, because suddenly in front of her was Zander. Wonderful, darling Zander, who she missed with all her heart. And Shay.\n \"I hate my subconscious so much,\" Bonnie mumbled to herself.\n Zander was gazing down at Shay with a small smile, giving her that adoring look that was supposed to be reserved for Bonnie alone. As Bonnie watched, he ran his hand gently over Shay\u0027s cheek, tipping her face toward him. Change it! Bonnie inwardly screamed at herself as Shay\u0027s and Zander\u0027s lips met in a soft, lingering kiss.\n Before she could focus, though, everything went black for one second, and she felt a powerful, painful yank as she was torn from the dream. When her eyes opened, she was somewhere new, a breeze ruffling her curls. And watching her, standing alarmingly close, his face alight with laughter, was Klaus.\n \"Hello, little redbird,\" he said. \"Isn\u0027t that what Damon used to call you?\"\n \"How do you know that?\" Bonnie said suspiciously. \"And where am I, anyway?\" The wind rose, blowing strands of hair across her face, and she shoved them back.\n \"I\u0027ve been having a good rummage around in your mind, redbird,\" Klaus said. \"I can\u0027t get to everything yet, but I can pick up bits and pieces.\" He smiled widely and engagingly. He\u0027d be quite handsome, really, Bonnie thought wildly, if he weren\u0027t so obviously insane. Klaus went on. \"That\u0027s why I picked this place to have our chat.\"\n Bonnie\u0027s head cleared a little, and she looked around. They were outdoors, on a tiny platform sheltered by an arched cupola. In every direction, a blue expanse spread out, and far below, a touch of green. Oh, jeez. They were somewhere really high.\n Bonnie hated heights. Forcing herself to look away from the long drop on every side, she stayed still, in the middle of the platform, as far as possible from the sides, and glared up at Klaus. \"Oh, yeah?\" she said. It wasn\u0027t the best line, but it was the best she could manage under the circumstances.\n Klaus smiled cheerfully. \"One of the pieces I came across was your memory of the orientation tour of campus. They offered to take you up in the bell tower, didn\u0027t they? But you said\" - and suddenly an eerie echo of Bonnie\u0027s voice rose up all around them, joking, but with a touch of actual fear - \"\u0027No way, Jose, if I go up that high I\u0027ll have screaming nightmares for a week!\u0027\" As the memory of Bonnie\u0027s voice died away, Klaus grinned. \"And so I thought this might be a good place for our heart-to-heart.\"\n Bonnie remembered the incident on the tour vividly. The bell tower, the highest spot on campus, was a popular place, but Bonnie couldn\u0027t look at it without her stomach clenching up. Zander and his friends liked to party on the rooftops of buildings, but rooftops tended to be a lot bigger than the bell tower, and there Bonnie could stay away from the edges. Plus, at those parties, she\u0027d had big, reassuring, protective Zander with her, which made all the difference.\n Still, she wasn\u0027t going to let Klaus see he was getting to her. Crossing her arms defiantly, she carefully looked only at Klaus. \"I was kidding on the tour,\" she lied. \"I just didn\u0027t want to climb all those stairs.\"\n \"Interesting,\" Klaus said, his smile widening, and then he raised his hands. He didn\u0027t touch Bonnie, but she found herself suddenly skidding back away from him, as if he was pushing her very hard. Her back collided at last with the railing at the edge of the platform, and she let out a helpless little whoof of air.\n \"Don\u0027t lie to me, redbird,\" Klaus said softly, walking toward her. \"I can smell your fear.\"\n Bonnie clenched her teeth and said nothing. She did not look behind her.\n \"Tell me Elena\u0027s secret, little bird,\" Klaus said, his voice still soft and coaxing. \"You\u0027re her witch, so you must know. Why couldn\u0027t I kill her in the battle? Did you do something?\"\n \"No idea. Maybe your knife was dull,\" Bonnie quipped.\n She squeaked involuntarily as her feet suddenly left the ground. She was - oh, God - dangling in midair like a puppet suspended by invisible strings. Then those strings yanked her backward, her ankles banging painfully against the top of the railing as she was swept powerlessly out to hang in empty space. Bonnie caught one terrifying glimpse of the campus far below her before she slammed her eyes shut. Don\u0027t let me fall, she prayed. Please, please. Her heart was pounding so hard she couldn\u0027t breathe.\n \"You know, they say that if you die in your dreams, you really die in your bed,\" Klaus said softly, sounding like he was right next to her. \"And I can tell you from personal experience that the saying\u0027s quite true.\" He let out a low, sickeningly excited laugh. \"If I drop you, they\u0027ll be picking pieces of you out of your bedroom walls for weeks,\" he said. \"But it doesn\u0027t have to come to that. Just tell me the truth and I\u0027ll let you down gently. I promise.\"\n Bonnie clenched her eyes and her jaw shut tighter. Even if she were willing to betray Elena - which she wasn\u0027t, she never would, no matter what, she told herself firmly - she didn\u0027t believe Klaus would keep his promise. She remembered dazedly how Vickie Bennett had died, though, at Klaus\u0027s hands. She\u0027d been torn to shreds, her blood spattered like a kid had swung around a can of red paint in her pink room. Maybe Klaus had killed Vickie in her dreams.\n Klaus chuckled, and the air around Bonnie shifted again.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" a confused, frightened, and oh-so-familiar voice asked. Bonnie\u0027s eyes snapped open.\n Next to her in midair dangled Zander. All the color was bleached out of his face, so that his wide, terrified eyes looked even more impossibly blue than usual. He was grasping at empty air with both hands, struggling to find something to hold on to.\n \"Bonnie?\" he croaked. \"Please, what\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Your girlfriend, or ex-girlfriend, is refusing to tell me something I want to know,\" Klaus told him. Klaus was seated on the railing of the bell tower, his own legs dangling off the side. He smiled at Zander. \"I thought if I brought you in, you might provide some incentive for her.\"\n Zander looked at Bonnie pleadingly. \"Please tell him, Bonnie,\" he begged. \"I need this to stop. Let me down.\"\n Bonnie gulped, panicking. \"Zander,\" she said. \"Zander, oh, no. Don\u0027t hurt him.\"\n \"Whatever happens to Zander now is your fault, redbird,\" Klaus reminded her.\n And then something clicked together. Hang on, a voice said inside Bonnie\u0027s head. The voice, cool and cynical, sounded sort of like Meredith. Zander\u0027s not scared of heights. He loves them.\n \"Stop it,\" she said to Klaus. \"That\u0027s not Zander. That\u0027s just something you made up. If you\u0027re finding stuff inside my head, you\u0027re doing a terrible job. Zander\u0027s nothing like that.\"\n Klaus gave a sharp growl of irritation, and the Zander he\u0027d created went limp in the air beside her, his head flopping to one side. He looked disturbingly dead like that, and even though Bonnie knew it wasn\u0027t real, she had to look away.\n She\u0027d known all along this was a dream, of course. But she\u0027d forgotten the central thing about controlling dreams: they weren\u0027t real.\n \"This is a dream,\" she murmured to herself. \"Nothing is real and I can change whatever I want.\" She looked at the false Zander and blipped him back out of existence.\n \"Clever, aren\u0027t you?\" Klaus commented, and then, as easily as opening his hand, he let her fall.\n Bonnie sucked in one frightened breath, and then remembered to make a floor under her feet. She stumbled as she landed, her ankle turning under her, but she wasn\u0027t hurt.\n \"It\u0027s not over yet, redbird,\" Klaus said, climbing down from the railing and walking toward her across the air as if it were solid, his dirty raincoat flapping in the breeze. He was still chuckling, and there was something about the sound that frightened Bonnie. Without even thinking about it, she flexed her mind and threw him as far as she could.\n Klaus\u0027s body flew backward, as floppy as a rag doll, and Bonnie had just a second to see his startled expression turn to rage before he was only a falling black speck on the horizon. As Bonnie watched, the speck stopped falling, turned, and rose, coming back toward her. It moved alarmingly fast, and soon she could make out the outline of some great predatory bird, a hawk perhaps, swooping toward her.\n Time to wake up, she thought. \"It\u0027s just a dream,\" she said. Nothing happened. Klaus was getting closer, much closer.\n \"It\u0027s only a dream,\" she repeated, \"and I can wake up anytime I want. I want to wake up now.\"\n And then she really did wake, warm under her comforter in her own cozy bed.\n After one gasp of pure relief, Bonnie began to cry - great, ugly, choking sobs. She reached onto her desk, feeling for her cell phone. The images of Zander, his face intent, kissing Shay, hanging powerlessly in the air, stuck with her. They hadn\u0027t been the real Zander; Bonnie knew that intellectually. But she needed to hear his voice anyway. Just as she was about to push the button to dial, she hesitated.\n It wasn\u0027t fair to call him, was it? She was the one who had said they should take some time apart, so Zander could think about what would be right for him, not just as a person, but as the Alpha of a Pack. It wouldn\u0027t be fair to call him to make herself feel better, just because Klaus had used his image in Bonnie\u0027s dream.\n She turned the phone off and shoved it back onto the desk, sobbing harder.\n \"Bonnie?\" The bed dipped as Meredith crossed the space from her own bed and sat on the edge of Bonnie\u0027s. \"Are you okay?\"\n In the morning, Bonnie would tell Meredith and the others everything. It was important that they know that Klaus had gotten into her dreams again, and that the techniques Alaric had researched had let Bonnie fight him off this time. But she couldn\u0027t talk about it right now, not in the dark.\n \"Bad dream,\" she said instead. \"Stay here for a minute, okay?\"\n \"Okay,\" Meredith said, and Bonnie felt her friend\u0027s thin, strong arm wrap around her shoulders. \"It\u0027ll be all right, Bonnie,\" Meredith said, patting her on the back.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Bonnie said, and buried her head on Meredith\u0027s shoulder and wept.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-28.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \n Destined for danger...
