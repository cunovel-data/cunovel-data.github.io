All she wanted to do was sleep, but someone wouldn\u0027t let her rest. Her legs hurt. Her head jolted against something, and Elena\u0027s perspective shifted. Someone was pulling her along by her legs, she realized, the rest of her body sliding along on the ground. Her hair caught, jerking her head before it came loose, and she groaned again. Slowly, she opened her eyes. \"Back with me, little one?\" Klaus said, sounding disconcertingly jovial. He was the one dragging her, Elena realized, and although it was dark, he clearly had sensed when she awoke. He laughed, his dark, disturbing chuckle making her cringe. \"I can\u0027t kill you with my teeth, or with my dagger, but an ordinary knife will work, won\u0027t it? I could tie you up and drop you in the lake to drown. What do you think?\" Elena\u0027s mouth was dry, and it took a couple of tries to get any sound out. \"I think,\" she said at last, thickly, \"that Stefan is going to save me.\" Klaus laughed again. \"Your precious Stefan won\u0027t be able to find you,\" he said. \"No one can save you now.\" They hadn\u0027t been to the safe house since they had left with Chloe, the night of Klaus\u0027s resurrection. When they arrived, the faint scent of vervain still lingered in the basement, and Stefan\u0027s skin itched in reaction. Meredith pried up a trapdoor in the floor, and Stefan lowered himself in first, the others following. Everyone but Matt had come, weapons in hand, carrying flashlights and lanterns, tense and ready to fight. Matt had stayed behind to search for Chloe. Bonnie, Alaric, and Meredith stuck close together, their faces pale and strained. Shay, Zander, and the other werewolves stayed together, too, alert to every noise or scent in the darkness. And Damon, Stefan, and Andres formed the vanguard, each one of them straining for some sign of Elena. They seemed to walk for miles, through underground passages that narrowed as they went, changing from concrete passages to dusty tunnels carved from dirt. Andres stopped frequently and touched the floor and walls, listening with his hands before picking a direction. \"Did you come this way when you smoked the tunnels?\" Stefan asked Meredith as they waited impatiently during one of these stops, and she shook her head, wide-eyed. \"We\u0027re a lot deeper underground than I knew the tunnels went,\" she said. \"I had no idea the Vitale Society had anything this elaborate.\" \"I wonder if it was the Vitale Society, actually,\" Bonnie interjected suddenly. \"They used these tunnels, but I keep getting a sense that there\u0027s something older here. Something creepy.\" Silently, Alaric raised his flashlight higher, illuminating a series of runes carved deep into the rock above them. \"I can\u0027t read them,\" he said, \"but these must predate Dalcrest by centuries.\" The darkness that pressed in from all sides, now that Stefan focused on it, seemed to breathe with ageless secrets. It was as if there was something huge and sleeping, just out of sight, wrapped in itself and waiting to awaken. His chest ached with anxiety. Elena . . . The steady thump of Klaus\u0027s footsteps stopped, but Elena was still sliding forward. With a shock, she realized that he was pulling her to him and she flailed desperately, trying to jerk herself away. She was so tired, though. She\u0027d used more of her Power than she ever had before, and she felt drained and helpless. Elena could do no more than struggle weakly as Klaus picked her up, gathering her in his arms as gently as if she was a baby. \"No,\" she whispered hoarsely. She felt Klaus\u0027s hand stroking her hair back, and she shuddered with repulsion at the gentle touch in the dark. She struggled weakly, but his Power was holding her in place. \"I could have let the fire kill you,\" he whispered, his voice intimate and almost tender, \"but what\u0027s poetic in that? My bite may not hurt you, but I want a taste of the girl that fascinates vampires so much. I\u0027ve never tasted a Guardian before. Is your blood especially sweet?\" He pressed his mouth against her neck and Elena cringed. She couldn\u0027t fight anymore. His fangs pushed into her, rough and demanding, and it felt as if her throat was being split open. She tried to scream, but only a whimper came out. He can\u0027t kill me this way, she reminded herself desperately. And yet it felt as if her life was draining away. Andres was standing perfectly still, one hand pressed against the rock. \"What is it?\" Stefan said sharply. Andres opened his eyes. His face was desolate. \"I\u0027ve lost her,\" he said. \"She was so close but now . . . she\u0027s not touching the Earth anymore. I don\u0027t know where she is.\" \"Elena! Elena!\" Stefan shouted as he ran, bursting past the rest of the group. She couldn\u0027t be gone. Behind him, he could hear the pounding of Damon\u0027s boots close on his tail. Ahead of the flashlights, they rounded the corner into complete darkness. Stefan funneled Power to his eyes so that he could see. Just ahead of them, Klaus raised his head, blood streaming from his mouth and dripping down his chin. In his arms, Elena lay limply, her silken, golden hair tangled and dirty, hanging down over Klaus\u0027s arm. Stefan snarled and rushed forward. Klaus licked at his lips, his pink tongue slow, and then he shuddered, a smile on his face. Slowly, still smiling, he collapsed to the ground, Elena landing with a thud in front of him. Stefan\u0027s heart plummeted even as he leaped toward her. Elena lay in the center of the path. She was motionless and very pale, her head turned to one side, eyes closed. Blood was everywhere, staining her once-white top a deep, rich red. Her throat was covered with gore. And beyond her, as limp as a discarded toy, lay Klaus. Although there was no mark on him other than a thin streak of blood at the corner of his mouth, Stefan had no doubt that he was dead. No one living looked like that, as if everything that had been part of him was gone, leaving a wax dummy in his place. Especially not the lightning-handler Klaus, who had shimmered with golden, filthy rage. He looked like a badly preserved corpse. Elena, though . . . To Stefan\u0027s wonder, Elena stirred, her eyelashes fluttering. Stefan gathered her into his arms. She was so pale, but her heartbeat was steady. Above him, Damon hovered, his mouth twisted with anxiety. \"She\u0027ll live,\" Damon muttered, partly to himself, partly to Stefan. Stefan opened his mouth to agree, but all that came out was a broken sob. He began to kiss Elena, peppering her cheeks and mouth and forehead and hands with light kisses. \"Stefan,\" she murmured weakly, and smiled. \"My Stefan.\" \"What happened?\" Bonnie asked as the others rounded the bend and ran forward. Only Andres stood still just past the bend in the tunnel, staring at Elena, his face full of wonder. \"She\u0027s the One,\" he breathed. \"The One what?\" Elena asked, still smiling dazedly. She raised her hand and stroked Stefan\u0027s cheek. Andres seemed to be having trouble speaking. He swallowed, licked his lips, and swallowed again, looking a little lost. \"There\u0027s a legend,\" he said finally, hesitantly. \"A Guardian legend. It says that one day a sworn Guardian, one born of a Principal Guardian, will come to Earth. Her blood, the blood of Guardians carried through generations, will be anathema to the Oldest creatures of darkness.\" \"What does that mean?\" Stefan asked sharply. Andres lifted his flashlight, lighting up Klaus\u0027s pathetic, diminished corpse. \"It means,\" he said, his voice full of wonder, \"that Elena\u0027s blood has killed Klaus. It would kill any of the Old Ones, the handful of vampires and demons that have walked the Earth since the dawn of human civilization . . . maybe before. It means,\" he said, \"that Elena is a very valuable weapon.\" \"Hang on,\" Damon said. \"That can\u0027t be right. I\u0027ve drunk Elena\u0027s blood. Stefan\u0027s drunk Elena\u0027s blood.\" Andres shrugged. \"Perhaps its qualities are only fatal to the Old Ones. That\u0027s all the legend tells of.\" \"And her blood is special,\" Stefan said, his voice rough. He and Damon exchanged quick, embarrassed glances. Elena\u0027s blood was rich and heady, countless times more potent than any other blood Stefan had ever tasted. He had thought the difference was because of the love they shared. \"But . . .\" Bonnie said, frowning. \"Your parents weren\u0027t Guardians, were they?\" she asked Elena. Elena shook her head, but her eyes were clouding over and her eyelids drooping. She needed rest, and proper medical care. \"We can talk about this later,\" Stefan said abruptly, and stood, lifting Elena carefully and gently into his arms. \"She needs to get out of here.\" \"Well, whether she\u0027s the One or not,\" Meredith said, looking at the dead monster at her feet, \"Elena killed Klaus.\" They all straightened unconsciously, smiling. They had nothing left to fear.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-37.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) Destined for danger...
