{"id":93730,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"Stefan clenched his fists together, the bite of his nails against his palms helping to stave off the fog of misery that was enfolding him. Elena wasn\u0027t dead. He wouldn\u0027t believe that.\\n\\n Full dark had fallen, and firefighters had finally put out the blaze that had consumed the old stables. They were carefully working through the debris, dragging out body after body.\\n\\n Outside the protective barriers, screened by a stand of trees, Stefan and the others waited. Meredith and Bonnie clung to each other, Bonnie in tears. Andres was seated, dazed and silent, on the ground, his eyes fixed on the slow movements of the firefighters.\\n\\n Stefan remembered the look on Elena\u0027s face as the fiery wall had come down upon her. She had seemed so resigned, so peaceful as she looked back at him one last time, the flames she had put between them rising faster. The wall had fallen so fast - how could she possibly have escaped?\\n\\n A hand landed on his shoulder, and Stefan looked up to see Damon frowning past him at the remains of the stable. \"She\u0027s not in there, you know,\" Damon said. \"Elena\u0027s got the luck of the devil. She\u0027d never get trapped in there.\"\\n\\n Stefan leaned into his brother\u0027s hand, just a little. He was tired and grief-stricken, and there was a comfort in Damon\u0027s familiarity. \"She died twice before her high-school graduation,\" he told Damon bitterly. \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d call that lucky. And both times, it was our fault.\"\\n\\n Damon sighed. \"She came back, though,\" he said gently. \"Not everyone gets to do that. Hardly anyone, really.\" His lips twitched into a half smile. \"Me, of course.\"\\n\\n Stefan twisted away, his eyes burning. \"Don\u0027t joke,\" he said in a furious, low mutter. \"How can - even you - how can you joke about this now? Do you care at all?\" But he shouldn\u0027t have been surprised. Damon had spent the last few weeks showing - violently, capriciously - how little he cared, for any of them.\\n\\n Damon looked at him, his dark eyes steady. \"I care,\" he said. \"You know I do. Even when I don\u0027t want to. But I know she\u0027s not dead. If you don\u0027t trust Elena\u0027s luck, think of Klaus. It would take more than a fire to kill him.\"\\n\\n \"Fire kills vampires,\" Stefan said stubbornly. \"Even old ones.\"\\n\\n \"He played with lightning,\" Damon said, and shuddered. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much that could kill Klaus.\"\\n\\n The firefighters had stopped their investigation, every inch of burned wood and earth turned over, and were covering the bodies with dark canvases.\\n\\n I\u0027ll check it out, Damon told Stefan silently, and transformed into a crow, flapping through the night to land in a tree near the corpses.\\n\\n A few moments later, he was back, becoming himself again before his feet had even hit the ground so that he stumbled a few paces, less polished and poised than usual. Stefan was vaguely aware of everyone, all their allies, gathering around, but his eyes were fixed beseechingly on Damon. He opened his mouth, but the question he needed to ask wouldn\u0027t come. Is Elena there? he thought desperately. Is she?\\n\\n If Elena was gone, if she had sacrificed herself to save them, Stefan would be dead by morning. There was nothing for him without her.\\n\\n \"Elena\u0027s not there,\" Damon said shortly. \"Neither is Klaus. It\u0027s all Klaus\u0027s descendants.\"\\n\\n Bonnie gave one short, broken sob of relief and Meredith squeezed her hand hard, knuckles whitening.\\n\\n \"Klaus must have her,\" Stefan said, the world swimming back into focus now that he had a purpose. \"We have to find them before we\u0027re too late.\"\\n\\n His eyes met Damon\u0027s, leaf-green and black holding, for once, exactly the same expression: fear and hope in equal measure. Damon nodded. Stefan\u0027s fingers relaxed where they still clutched Damon\u0027s shirt and he pulled his brother to him in a brief embrace, trying to send him all the love and gratitude he would never be able to put into words. Damon was back. And if anyone could help Stefan save Elena, it was Damon.\\n\\n \"Is there anything you can do?\" Stefan asked Andres. He could hear the pleading note in his own voice.\\n\\n All around them, the others looked tense, waiting for the answer. Bonnie was tending to Shay\u0027s shoulder, bandaging a nasty vampire bite, and her deft fingers stiffened with anxiety until Shay gave a quiet grunt.\\n\\n \"I hope I can,\" said Andres. \"I\u0027ll try.\" He knelt and laid his palms flat against the ground beneath the trees. Watching him, Stefan felt the cracklings of Power in the air. Andres held very still, brown eyes narrowed and focused. New blades of grass poked through the earth, curling around his fingers.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t as effective as Elena\u0027s tracking Power,\" he explained, \"but sometimes I can sense people. If she\u0027s touching the Earth, I will know where she is.\"\\n\\n Andres sat there for what seemed like a long time, his face peaceful and alert. As he sank his fingers deeper into the ground, digging the tips into the soil at the base of a white birch tree, the tree unfurled new leaves.\\n\\n \"Faster,\" Damon ordered, his voice low and dangerous, but Andres did not respond with even a twitch. It was as if he had sunk so deeply into himself - or into his communion with the soil, Stefan wasn\u0027t sure which - that he couldn\u0027t hear them anymore.\\n\\n Stefan\u0027s pulse was pounding faster than he could remember since before he\u0027d become a vampire. He clenched and unclenched his fists, keeping himself from shaking Andres. The Guardian was doing the best he could, and distracting him would not make him work faster. But Elena, oh, Elena.\\n\\n Farther away, he could hear Matt searching the woods, calling, \"Chloe! Chloe!\" The young vampire had made it out of the stables; Stefan was sure he had seen her, blackened with ash but otherwise unhurt. Now, however, she was nowhere to be found. Stefan\u0027s heart ached in sympathy. The girl Matt loved was missing, too.\\n\\n \"Strange,\" Andres said. It was the first word he had spoken in a while, and Stefan\u0027s attention immediately snapped back to him. Andres tilted his head back to look up at Damon and Stefan, his forehead crinkling in confusion. \"Elena\u0027s alive,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure she\u0027s alive, but it feels like she\u0027s underground.\"\\n\\n Stefan sagged in relief: alive. He looked at Damon for confirmation. \"The tunnels?\" he asked, and Damon nodded. Klaus must have taken her to the tunnels that crisscrossed the ground underneath the campus, the ones the Vitale Society had used.\\n\\n Meredith, sitting nearby with Alaric, jumped to her feet. \"Where\u0027s the closest entrance?\" she asked.\\n\\n Stefan tried to picture the maze of passages Matt had sketched for him before their battle against the Vitale vampires. There were many blank areas and half-drawn entrances on his mental map, because Matt had only traveled a little way in what seemed to be a vast, twisting labyrinth underlying the campus and maybe the town. But, of what he knew . . .\\n\\n \"The vampires\u0027 safe house,\" Stefan said decisively. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-36.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \\n Destined for danger...
