{"id":93700,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"When Stefan knocked on the door of Damon\u0027s apartment, Damon opened it almost immediately, glared at Stefan, and tried to slam the door shut in his face. \"Stop,\" Stefan said, inserting his shoulder in the doorway. \"You must have been able to sense that it was me.\" \"I knew you\u0027d keep knocking or find a way in if I didn\u0027t answer,\" Damon said fiercely. \"So I\u0027m answering. Now go away.\" Damon looked wrecked. Nothing could take away from the elegance of his features, but they were tense and drawn, the skin over his cheekbones white with strain. His lips were pale, his dark eyes bloodshot, and his usually sleek black hair disarranged. Stefan ignored his words and leaned closer, trying to make his brother meet his eyes. \"Damon,\" he said. \"I found the girl in the woods last night.\" Anyone who hadn\u0027t known Damon as long and as well as Stefan had - and so anyone except Stefan - would have missed the split second of stillness before Damon\u0027s face settled into cool disdain. \"Have you come to preach to me, baby brother?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t have the time just now, but perhaps another day? Next week sometime?\" He slid his eyes over Stefan, then glanced away dismissively. Just like that, Stefan felt like a child again, back home all those centuries ago, and his daring, charming, despicable, infuriating older brother was putting him in his place. \"She was still alive,\" Stefan said steadily. \"I took her home. She\u0027s all right.\" Damon shrugged. \"How nice for you. Always the parfait knight.\" Stefan\u0027s hand shot out and gripped Damon\u0027s arm. \"Dammit, Damon,\" he said, frustrated, \"stop playing with me. I came to tell you that you have to be careful. If you had killed that girl, it would have caught up with you.\" Damon blinked at him. \"That\u0027s it?\" he asked, his voice the smallest bit less hostile. \"You want me to be careful? Don\u0027t you have an overwhelming urge to scold me, little brother? Threaten me, maybe?\" Stefan sighed and slumped against the doorframe, his urgency sucked away. \"Would scolding you do any good, Damon?\" he asked. \"Or threatening you? It\u0027s never worked before. I just don\u0027t want you to kill anyone. You\u0027re my brother, and we need each other.\" Damon\u0027s face tightened again, and Stefan reconsidered his words. Sometimes talking to Damon was like walking through a minefield. \"I need you, anyway,\" he said. \"You saved my life. Which, in case you didn\u0027t notice, you\u0027ve done a lot this past year.\" Damon leaned against the opposite side of the doorframe and studied Stefan, his face thoughtful, but remained silent. Wishing he knew what Damon was thinking, Stefan sent a questing tendril of Power toward his brother, trying to catch his mood, but Damon merely sneered, easily shutting him out. Stefan bowed his head and kneaded the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger. Was it always going to be like this, for the next long centuries together? \"Look,\" he said. \"There\u0027s enough going on with the other vampires on campus without you starting to hunt again. Ethan\u0027s still alive, and he\u0027s planning to try to bring back Klaus tomorrow night.\" Damon\u0027s frown deepened for a moment, then smoothed out. His face could have been carved from stone. \"We can\u0027t stop him without you,\" Stefan continued, his mouth dry. Damon\u0027s night-dark eyes gave nothing away and then he flashed his briefest, most brilliant smile. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not interested.\" \"What?\" Stefan felt like he\u0027d been kicked in the stomach. He had expected Damon\u0027s defensiveness and sarcasm. But after Damon had saved him from Ethan, the last thing he had expected was indifference. Damon shrugged, straightening up and adjusting his clothes, brushing an imagined speck of dust from the front of his black shirt. \"I\u0027ve had enough,\" he said, his tone casual. \"Meddling in the affairs of your pet humans has gone stale for me. If Ethan brings back Klaus, then he can deal with him. I doubt it\u0027ll go well for him.\" \"Klaus will remember that you attacked him,\" Stefan said. \"He\u0027ll be after you.\" Cocking one eyebrow, Damon smiled again, a quick, savage baring of his white teeth. \"I doubt I\u0027ll be his first priority, little brother,\" he said. And it was true, Stefan remembered. In that hideous last battle with Klaus, Damon had stabbed the Old One with white ash, keeping him from striking the final blow against Stefan. But he hadn\u0027t been responsible for Klaus\u0027s death. Stefan had engineered the fight against Klaus, had done his best to kill him. But, in the end, he had failed, too. It was Elena, bringing an army of the dead against the Original vampire, who had killed him. \"Elena,\" Stefan said desperately. \"Elena needs you.\" He was positive that would do it, that Damon\u0027s armor would crack. Damon always came through for Elena. But this time Damon\u0027s lip curled in a sneer. \"I\u0027m sure you can handle things,\" he said lightly, his voice brittle. \"Elena\u0027s well-being is your responsibility now, not mine.\" \"Damon - \" \"No.\" Damon held up a warning hand. \"I told you. I\u0027m done.\" And with one quick motion, he slammed the door in Stefan\u0027s face. Stefan rested his forehead against the door, feeling defeated. \"Damon,\" he said again. He knew Damon could hear him, but there was only silence from inside the apartment. Slowly, he backed away from the door. It would be best not to push Damon, not when he was in this mood. In this mood, Damon might do anything. \"I\u0027m so glad you came to see me, Elena,\" Professor Campbell said. \"I was worried about you after\" - he glanced around surreptitiously and lowered his voice, although they were alone in his office - \"our last talk.\" He peered at her cautiously, his usually inquisitive and rather smug face clouded with uncertainty. \"I\u0027m sorry I ran off like that, James,\" Elena told him, staring down into the cup of sweet, milky coffee he had given her. \"It\u0027s just . . . when you told me I was a Guardian and the truth about what happened to my parents, I needed some time to think. Last summer, I met a few Guardians. They were powerful, but so inhuman.\" She still couldn\u0027t accept that she was supposed to become like them. The whole idea was so big and horrifying that her mind kept scuttling away from it, focusing on solid and immediate concerns like the vampires on campus instead. Elena\u0027s hands shook a little, making the coffee swirl and eddy. She carefully steadied her cup. James patted her gently on the shoulder. \"Well, I have been doing some research, and I think I have good news,\" he said. \"I could use good news,\" she said softly, almost pleadingly. \"I don\u0027t really understand what a human Guardian would be like. Would I be different than a Celestial Guardian?\" James smiled for the first time since she had walked into his office. \"After we spoke,\" he said, \"I started to contact all my old colleagues who have studied mythology or magic, anyone who I thought might know something about the Guardians.\" Now that he had information to impart, James lost his tentativeness and seemed to expand, his shoulders relaxing as he hooked his thumbs into his suit vest. \"Legend has it,\" he said, his voice taking on its lecturing tone, \"that human Guardians are rare, but there are always two or three in the world. Generally, their parents are recruited in the same way the Guardians recruited your parents, and then the children are handed over to the Guardians for training as they enter adolescence.\" Elena closed her eyes for a moment, wincing. She couldn\u0027t imagine being given to the Guardians and losing her human life so young. But if she had been, her mother and father would still be alive. \"When the human Guardians reach young adulthood - about your age, Elena,\" James continued, \"they\u0027re stationed where there are high concentrations of ley lines and, therefore, large amounts of supernatural activity.\" \"Like here,\" Elena said. \"And Fell\u0027s Church.\" James nodded. \"The evidence shows pretty strongly that the Guardians recruit prospective parents from ley line - heavy places,\" he said. \"So the human Guardians can stay near their homes.\" \"But what are the human Guardians for?\" Elena asked. \"What am I supposed to do?\" She realized she was gripping her cup so tightly she might break it, so she put it down on James\u0027s desk and held on to the arms of her chair instead. \"The role of the human Guardians is to protect the innocent from the supernatural on Earth,\" James said. \"They maintain balance. And it seems that the Guardians develop different powers depending on what is needed where they live. So we won\u0027t know what your exact powers are until they begin to form.\" \"Protecting the innocent, I can handle,\" Elena said. She gave James a shaky smile. She wasn\u0027t so sure about \"maintaining balance.\" In her opinion, the Guardians of the Celestial Court had been so obsessed with balance and order that they had forgotten about the innocent. Or perhaps the innocent were only the concern of the Guardians on Earth. But if that was true, wouldn\u0027t someone have looked out for her parents? James smiled back. \"That\u0027s what I thought. And,\" he said, with an air of having saved the best for last, \"my colleague has located one of the other Guardians on Earth.\" He pulled a sheet of paper from a folder on his desk and passed it to her. It was a printout of a color photograph, a little grainy. In it, a dark-haired man, maybe a year or two older than Elena, smiled at the camera. His brown eyes were narrowed in the sun\u0027s glare and his teeth were bright white against his tan skin. \"His name is Andres Montez, and he\u0027s a human Guardian who lives in Costa Rica. My sources didn\u0027t have a lot of personal information about him, but they\u0027re going to try contacting him. I\u0027m hoping he\u0027ll be willing to come to Dalcrest to teach you what he knows.\" James hesitated, then added, \"Although, as a Guardian, I imagine he probably already knows all about you.\" Elena traced Andres\u0027s face in the picture. Did she want to meet another Guardian? Those dark eyes seemed kind, though. \"It would be good to talk to someone who could tell me what to expect,\" she told James, looking up. \"Thank you for finding him.\" James nodded. \"I\u0027ll let you know as soon as I can get him here,\" he said. Despite the news that there was someone else out there like her, someone who might understand, Elena\u0027s stomach lurched and she felt like she was falling, spiraling down into something deep and dark and unknown. Would Andres be able to tell her what she most needed to know? Would she still be Elena once her fate caught up with her?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-5.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) Destined for danger...
