{"id":93705,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"A headless body found in the woods near Dalcrest College last week has now been identified as Dalcrest senior Ethan Crane,\" announced the pretty newscaster on the TV morning show, her forehead crinkling seriously. \"Police have not yet released a statement on whether Crane was the victim of a murder or a freak accident, but judging from the difference in wounds, Crane\u0027s death appears unrelated to the most recent animal attacks in the woods.\"\\n\\n As the newscaster went on to another story, Meredith flipped off the TV, hissing in irritation.\\n\\n \"They must think everyone who watches the news is a moron,\" she muttered. \"How could someone lose their head in a freak accident in the woods?\"\\n\\n Even though the student lounge was empty except for the five of them - Elena, Bonnie, Meredith, Stefan, and Zander - Elena lowered her voice and glanced around before answering. \"They don\u0027t want people to panic any more than they are already.\"\\n\\n The empty lounge was a sign of how frightened everyone already was, Elena thought. The first couple of weeks of school, the lounge had been packed in the evenings, guys and girls hanging out to watch TV or flirt or even study.\\n\\n Now, though, everyone was wary, sticking to their rooms in case one of the friendly faces on campus was masking a killer. Elena was constantly on edge, too. She and her friends checked and rechecked their weapons, tried to anticipate what Klaus might do. And yet he\u0027d done nothing, as far as they could tell.\\n\\n \"My psychology class was canceled this week,\" Bonnie told the others. \"And there\u0027s hardly anyone left in my English section. A lot of people have left.\" She hesitated, her wide brown eyes flicking between Elena and Zander. \"My father wants me to come home and see if we can get the tuition refunded. He says I could come back next year if they get to the bottom of all the attacks and disappearances,\" she confessed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going home, are you?\" Elena asked her. Bonnie\u0027s dad had always been superprotective of Bonnie and her older sisters, so Elena wasn\u0027t surprised by this news.\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027m not going,\" Bonnie said stoutly. \"You guys need me here.\" She snuggled closer to Zander and tipped her head back against his chest to smile up at him. He smiled back, wide and warmly, and Elena found herself smiling, too. Zander was such a guy\u0027s guy, not really Elena\u0027s type at all, but it was wonderful to see Bonnie with someone who liked her so much that pure contentment just shone out of him whenever they were together.\\n\\n Stefan cleared his throat to get their attention. \"I don\u0027t know where Klaus is feeding, but I don\u0027t think the bodies that have been found in the woods are people he killed. The news reports are saying they look like animal attacks, and, uh\" - he looked down at his feet, his face slightly embarrassed - \"I compelled a police officer to find out what the police have seen. The kills are really sloppy; they look like an animal actually is attacking people, so it\u0027s not just a cover story as far as the police are concerned.\"\\n\\n \"So you think it\u0027s the new vampires who are killing people, not one as experienced as Klaus,\" Elena said. Stefan met her eyes and she knew he was thinking the same thing she was: not Damon, either. A great wave of relief broke over her.\\n\\n If Damon crossed that line, if he started killing again, she didn\u0027t know what they would do. She couldn\u0027t imagine that they\u0027d betray him, turn him over to the others, or hunt him down. So much had changed between Stefan and Damon. Elena knew Stefan would protect his brother now, choose him over anyone else except perhaps Elena herself.\\n\\n But it hadn\u0027t come to that yet. It never would, Elena told herself fiercely. Damon might have lost control once, but no lasting harm had been done. The girl was fine. And it was the new vampires, the ones Ethan had turned, who were killing.\\n\\n Meredith was watching her, her gray eyes sympathetic. \"People are still dying, even if the killer is not Klaus,\" she said gently. With a start, Elena realized that she\u0027d given away her relief that it wasn\u0027t Damon. Luckily, Meredith had misinterpreted Elena\u0027s reaction. \"We can\u0027t guess what game Klaus is playing or what his plans are until he reveals himself,\" Meredith went on. A lock of dark hair fell over her cheek and she tucked it back behind her ear. \"But we can target the Vitale vampires. Gassing the tunnels didn\u0027t work, and we can\u0027t make more gas unless we can get a lot more vervain than we have now. We should be patrolling regularly to keep the students safer.\"\\n\\n She dug into her backpack and pulled out a campus map, carefully annotated in red ink, and traced an area on the map with one finger. \"I\u0027ve marked their hunting grounds here, and I think we can focus our patrols on the woods and on the playing fields on the edge of campus. We need to organize and make sure we\u0027ve got nightly patrols that have enough strong fighters in them to take down a group of young vampires.\"\\n\\n \"What about during the day?\" Bonnie asked, frowning and reaching for the map. \"They\u0027ve all got lapis lazuli, don\u0027t they? So they could be out hunting anytime.\"\\n\\n Stefan stirred restlessly next to Elena on the couch. \"Even though the sunlight doesn\u0027t kill them, they\u0027ll be laying low during the day,\" he explained. \"Sunlight bothers vampires even with the lapis lazuli. Night is a vampire\u0027s natural habitat, and they won\u0027t leave it unless they\u0027re forced to.\"\\n\\n Elena looked at him in surprise, but said nothing. Stefan lived in the day with her, slept at night. Did it hurt him, too? Had he changed so much, just to be with Elena?\\n\\n \"So nighttime patrols ought to be enough, at least for now,\" Meredith said.\\n\\n Zander examined the map closely, his white-blond head close to Bonnie\u0027s red one. \"I can organize the guys to take some of the patrols,\" he offered. Stefan nodded to Zander in acknowledgment. Meredith turned to Elena, her gray eyes sharp. \"What about Damon?\" she asked. \"We could really use him.\"\\n\\n Elena hesitated. Beside her, Stefan cleared his throat. \"My brother isn\u0027t available right now,\" he said, his voice expressionless. \"But I\u0027ll let you know if anything changes.\"\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s lips tightened. Elena could imagine what was going through her friend\u0027s head: Damon, irritating but always there, had finally, over the past summer and fall, proven himself as a worthwhile ally, only to disappear when the campus was falling into chaos around them?\\n\\n If that was what Meredith was thinking, she didn\u0027t say anything, just narrowed her eyes and let out a long sigh, then asked, \"What about you, Bonnie? Are there any spells that will help the patrols?\"\\n\\n \"There are a few protection spells I already know that could be useful,\" Bonnie said thoughtfully. \"I\u0027m going to call Mrs. Flowers and see what else she recommends.\"\\n\\n Elena smiled across at her friend. With the discovery of her talent for witchcraft, Bonnie had found a new confidence. Bonnie looked up and caught her eye, then smiled back.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll beat them, won\u0027t we, Elena?\" she said softly. \"And Klaus, too, when he shows up again.\"\\n\\n \"We did before, after all,\" Elena said lightly. Bonnie\u0027s expression sobered, and Meredith picked up the map again, turning it over thoughtfully in her hands. Next to Elena, Stefan reached to take her hand in his. They all knew just what it had taken to beat Klaus the first time they had faced him: Damon and Stefan united, and an army of the dead of Fell\u0027s Church, rising up from the land where they had fallen in battle. Not something they could duplicate. And even then, they had barely survived.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re stronger now,\" Bonnie said uncertainly. \"Right?\"\\n\\n Elena forced herself to smile. \"Of course we are,\" she said. Meredith\u0027s hand took hold of Elena\u0027s, and Elena felt comforted and strengthened by Stefan, her love, on one side, and Meredith, her friend, on the other. Bonnie raised her head proudly, her small face defiant, and Zander straightened beside her.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re invincible when we\u0027re together,\" Elena told them, and looking around at their resolute faces, she almost believed it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-hunters-destiny-rising-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-10.html","bookId":2123,"book":{"id":2123,"title":"The Hunters: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Destiny Rising (The Vampire Diaries: The Hunters #3) \\n Destined for danger...
