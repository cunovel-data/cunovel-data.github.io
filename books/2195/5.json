It was as small as the one in Clarice, the one most Renard Parish people were carried to. But the Grainger hospital was newer and had more of the diagnostic machines modern hospitals seemed to require.\\n\\n I\u0027d changed into jeans and a sweater, but I\u0027d resumed wearing my lined slicker. As Jason and I hurried to the sliding glass doors, I was patting myself on the back for wearing boots. Weather-wise, the evening was proving as nasty as the morning had been.\\n\\n The hospital was roiling with shifters. I could feel their anger as soon as I was inside. Two of the werepanthers from Hotshot were in the lobby; I figured they were acting as guards. Jason went to them and took their hands firmly. Maybe he exchanged some kind of secret shake or something; I don\u0027t know. At least they didn\u0027t rub against one another\u0027s legs. They didn\u0027t seem quite as happy to see Jason as he was to see them, and I noticed that Jason stepped back from them with a little frown between his eyes. The two looked at me intently. The man was of medium height and stocky, and he had thick brownish-blond hair. His eyes were full of curiosity.\\n\\n \"Sook, this is Dixon Mayhew,\" Jason said. \"And this is Dixie Mayhew, his twin sister.\" Dixie wore her hair, the same color as her brother\u0027s, almost as short as Dixon\u0027s, but she had dark, almost black, eyes. The twins were certainly not identical.\\n\\n \"Has it been quiet here?\" I asked carefully.\\n\\n \"No problems so far,\" Dixie said, keeping her voice low. Dixon\u0027s gaze was fixed on Jason. \"How\u0027s your boss?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in a cast, but he\u0027ll heal.\"\\n\\n \"Calvin was shot bad.\" Dixie eyed me for a minute. \"He\u0027s up in 214.\"\\n\\n Having been given the seal of approval, Jason and I went to the stairs. The twins watched us all the way. We passed the hospital auxiliary \"pink lady\" on duty at the visitors\u0027 desk. I felt kind of worried about her: white-haired, heavy glasses, sweet face with a full complement of wrinkles. I hoped nothing would happen during her watch to upset her worldview.\\n\\n It was easy to pick which room was Calvin\u0027s. A slab of muscle was leaning against the wall outside, a barrel-shaped man I\u0027d never seen. He was a werewolf. Werewolves make good bodyguards, according to the common wisdom of the two-natured, because they are ruthless and tenacious. From what I\u0027ve seen, that\u0027s just the bad-boy image Weres have. But it\u0027s true that as a rule, they\u0027re the roughest element of the two-natured community. You won\u0027t find too many Were doctors, for example, but you will find a lot of Weres in construction work. Jobs relating to motorcycles are heavily dominated by Weres, too. Some of those gangs do more than drink beer on the full-moon nights.\\n\\n Seeing a Were disturbed me. I was surprised the panthers of Hotshot had brought in an outsider. Jason murmured, \"That\u0027s Dawson. He owns the small engine repair shop between Hotshot and Grainger.\"\\n\\n Dawson was on the alert as we came down the hall.\\n\\n \"Jason Stackhouse,\" he said, identifying my brother after a minute. Dawson was wearing a denim shirt and jeans, but his biceps were about to burst through the material. His black leather boots were battle scarred.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve come to see how Calvin is doing,\" Jason said. \"This here\u0027s my sister, Sookie.\"\\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am,\" Dawson rumbled. He eyeballed me slowly, and there wasn\u0027t anything lascivious about it. I was glad I\u0027d left my purse in the locked truck. He would\u0027ve gone through it, I was sure. \"You want to take off that coat and turn around for me?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t take offense; Dawson was doing his job. I didn\u0027t want Calvin to get hurt again, either. I took off my slicker, handed it to Jason, and rotated. A nurse who\u0027d been entering something in a chart watched this procedure with open curiosity. I held Jason\u0027s jacket as he took his turn. Satisfied, Dawson knocked on the door. Though I didn\u0027t hear a response, he must have, because he opened the door and said, \"The Stackhouses.\"\\n\\n Just a whisper of a voice came from the room. Dawson nodded.\\n\\n \"Miss Stackhouse, you can go in,\" he said. Jason started to follow me, but Dawson put a massive arm in front of him. \"Only your sister,\" he said.\\n\\n Jason and I began to protest at the same moment, but then Jason shrugged. \"Go ahead, Sook,\" he said. There was obviously no budging Dawson, and there was no point to upsetting a wounded man, for that matter. I pushed the heavy door wide open.\\n\\n Calvin was by himself, though there was another bed in the room. The panther leader looked awful. He was pale and drawn. His hair was dirty, though his cheeks above his trim beard had been shaved. He was wearing a hospital gown, and he was hooked up to lots of things.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I blurted. I was horrified. Though many brains had indicated as much, I could see that if Calvin hadn\u0027t been two-natured, the wound would have killed him instantly. Whoever had shot him had wanted his death.\\n\\n Calvin turned his head to me, slowly and with effort. \"It\u0027s not as bad as it looks,\" he said dryly, his voice a thread. \"They\u0027re going to take me off some of this stuff tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Where were you hit?\" I asked.\\n\\n Calvin moved one hand to touch his upper left chest. His golden brown eyes captured mine. I went closer to him and covered his hand with mine. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said again. His fingers curled under mine until he was holding my hand.\\n\\n \"There\u0027ve been others,\" he said in a whisper of a voice.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Your boss.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"That poor girl.\"\\n\\n I nodded again.\\n\\n \"Whoever\u0027s doing this, they\u0027ve got to be stopped.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got to be someone who hates shifters. The police will never find out who\u0027s doing this. We can\u0027t tell them what to look for.\"\\n\\n Well, that was part of the problem of keeping your condition a secret. \"It\u0027ll be harder for them to find the person,\" I conceded. \"But maybe they will.\"\\n\\n \"Some of my people wonder if the shooter is someone who\u0027s a shifter,\" Calvin said. His fingers tightened around mine. \"Someone who didn\u0027t want to become a shifter in the first place. Someone who was bitten.\"\\n\\n It took a second for the light to click on in my head. I am such an idiot.\\n\\n \"Oh, no, Calvin, no, no,\" I said, my words stumbling over each other in my haste. \"Oh, Calvin, please don\u0027t let them go after Jason. Please, he\u0027s all I\u0027ve got.\" Tears began to run down my cheeks as if someone had turned on a faucet in my head. \"He was telling me how much he enjoyed being one of you, even if he couldn\u0027t be exactly like a born panther. He\u0027s so new, he hasn\u0027t had time to figure out who all else is two-natured. I don\u0027t think he even realized Sam and Heather were....\"\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s gonna take him out until we know the truth,\" Calvin said. \"Though I might be in this bed, I\u0027m still the leader.\" But I could tell he\u0027d had to argue against it, and I also knew (from hearing it right out of Calvin\u0027s brain) that some of the panthers were still in favor of executing Jason. Calvin couldn\u0027t prevent that. He might be angry afterward, but if Jason were dead, that wouldn\u0027t make one little bit of difference. Calvin\u0027s fingers released mine, and his hand rose with an effort to wipe the tears off my cheek.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a sweet woman,\" he said. \"I wish you could love me.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could, too,\" I said. So many of my problems would be solved if I loved Calvin Norris. I\u0027d move out to Hotshot, become a member of the secretive little community. Two or three nights a month, I\u0027d have to be sure to stay inside, but other than that, I\u0027d be safe. Not only would Calvin defend me to the death, but so would the other members of the Hotshot clan.\\n\\n But the thought of it just made me shudder. The windswept open fields, the powerful and ancient crossroads around which the little houses clustered... I didn\u0027t think I could handle the perpetual isolation from the rest of the world. My Gran would have urged me to accept Calvin\u0027s offer. He was a steady man, was a shift leader at Norcross, a job that came with good benefits. You might think that\u0027s laughable, but wait until you have to pay for your insurance all by yourself; then laugh.\\n\\n It occurred to me (as it should have right away) that Calvin was in a perfect position to force my compliance - Jason\u0027s life for my companionship - and he hadn\u0027t taken advantage of it.\\n\\n I leaned over and gave Calvin a kiss on the cheek. \"I\u0027ll pray for your recovery,\" I said. \"Thank you for giving Jason a chance.\" Maybe Calvin\u0027s nobility was partly due to the fact that he was in no shape to take advantage of me, but it was nobility, and I noted and appreciated it. \"You\u0027re a good man,\" I said, and touched his face. The hair of his neat beard felt soft.\\n\\n His eyes were steady as he said good-bye. \"Watch out for that brother of yours, Sookie,\" he said. \"Oh, and tell Dawson I don\u0027t want no more company tonight.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t take my word for it,\" I said.\\n\\n Calvin managed to smile. \"Wouldn\u0027t be much of a bodyguard if he did, I guess.\"\\n\\n I relayed the message to the Were. But sure enough, as Jason and I walked back to the stairs, Dawson was going into the room to check with Calvin.\\n\\n I debated for a couple of minutes before I decided it would be better if Jason knew what he was up against. In the truck, as he drove home, I relayed my conversation with Calvin to my brother.\\n\\n He was horrified that his new buddies in the werepanther world could believe such a thing of him. \"If I\u0027d thought of that before I changed for the first time, I can\u0027t say it wouldn\u0027t have been tempting,\" Jason said as we drove back to Bon Temps through the rain. \"I was mad. Not just mad, furious. But now that I\u0027ve changed, I see it different.\" He went on and on while my thoughts ran around inside my head in a circle, trying to think of a way out of this mess.\\n\\n The sniping case had to be solved by the next full moon. If it wasn\u0027t, the others might tear Jason up when they changed. Maybe he could just roam the woods around his house when he turned into his panther-man form, or maybe he could hunt the woods around my place - but he wouldn\u0027t be safe out at Hotshot. And they might come looking for him. I couldn\u0027t defend him against them all.\\n\\n By the next full moon, the shooter had to be in custody.\\n\\n Until I was washing my few dishes that night, it didn\u0027t strike me as odd that though Jason was being accused by the werepanther community of being an assassin, I was the one who\u0027d actually shot a shifter. I\u0027d been thinking of the private detectives\u0027 appointment to meet me here the next morning. And, as I found myself doing out of habit, I\u0027d been scanning the kitchen for signs of the death of Debbie Pelt. From watching the Discovery Channel and the Learning Channel, I knew that there was no way I could completely eradicate the traces of blood and tissue that had spattered my kitchen, but I\u0027d scrubbed and cleaned over and over. I was certain that no casual glance - in fact, no careful inspection by the naked eye - could reveal anything amiss in this room.\\n\\n I had done the only thing I could, short of standing there to be murdered. Was that what Jesus had meant by turning the other cheek? I hoped not, because every instinct in me had urged me to defend myself, and the means at hand had been a shotgun.\\n\\n Of course, I should immediately have reported it. But by then, Eric\u0027s wound had healed, the one made when Debbie\u0027d hit him while trying to shoot me. Aside from the testimony of a vampire and myself, there was no proof that she\u0027d fired first, and Debbie\u0027s body would have been a powerful statement of our guilt. My first instinct had been to cover up her visit to my house. Eric hadn\u0027t given me any other advice, which also might have changed things.\\n\\n No, I wasn\u0027t blaming my predicament on Eric. He hadn\u0027t even been in his right mind at the time. It was my own fault that I hadn\u0027t sat down to think things through. There would have been gunshot residue on Debbie\u0027s hand. Her gun had been fired. Some of Eric\u0027s dried blood would have been on the floor. She\u0027d broken in through my front door, and the door had shown clear signs of her trespass. Her car was hidden across the road, and only her fingerprints would\u0027ve been in it.\\n\\n I\u0027d panicked, and blown it.\\n\\n I just had to live with that.\\n\\n But I was very sorry about the uncertainty her family was suffering. I owed them certainty - which I couldn\u0027t deliver.\\n\\n I wrung out the washcloth and hung it neatly over the sink divider. I dried off my hands and folded the dish towel. Okay, now I\u0027d gotten my guilt straight. That was so much better! Not. Angry with myself, I stomped out to the living room and turned on the television: another mistake. There was a story about Heather\u0027s funeral; a news crew from Shreveport had come to cover the modest service this afternoon. Just think of the sensation it would cause if the media realized how the sniper was selecting his victims. The news anchor, a solemn African-American man, was saying that police in Renard Parish had discovered other clusters of apparently random shootings in small towns in Tennessee and Mississippi. I was startled. A serial shooter, here?\\n\\n The phone rang. \"Hello,\" I said, not expecting anything good.\\n\\n \"Sookie, hi, it\u0027s Alcide.\"\\n\\n I found myself smiling. Alcide Herveaux, who worked in his father\u0027s surveying business in Shreveport, was one of my favorite people. He was a Were, he was both sexy and hardworking, and I liked him very much. He\u0027d also been Debbie Pelt\u0027s fianc¨¦. But Alcide had abjured her before she vanished, in a rite that made her invisible and inaudible to him - not literally, but in effect.\\n\\n \"Sookie, I\u0027m at Merlotte\u0027s. I\u0027d thought you might be working tonight, so I drove over. Can I come to the house? I need to talk to you.\"\\n\\n \"You know you\u0027re in danger, coming to Bon Temps.\"\\n\\n \"No, why?\"\\n\\n \"Because of the sniper.\" I could hear the bar sounds in the background. There was no mistaking Arlene\u0027s laugh. I was betting the new bartender was charming one and all.\\n\\n \"Why would I worry about that?\" Alcide hadn\u0027t been thinking about the news too hard, I decided.\\n\\n \"All the people who got shot? They were two-natured,\" I said. \"Now they\u0027re saying on the news there\u0027ve been a lot more across the south. Random shootings in small towns. Bullets that match the one recovered from Heather Kinman here. And I\u0027m betting all the other victims were shape-shifters, too.\"\\n\\n There was a thoughtful silence on the end of the line, if silence can be characterized.\\n\\n \"I hadn\u0027t realized,\" Alcide said. His deep, rumbly voice was even more deliberate than normal.\\n\\n \"Oh, and have you talked to the private detectives?\"\\n\\n \"What? What are you talking about?\"\\n\\n \"If they see us talking together, it\u0027ll look very suspicious to Debbie\u0027s family.\"\\n\\n \"Debbie\u0027s family has hired private eyes to look for her?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, I\u0027m coming to your house.\" He hung up the phone.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know why on earth the detectives would be watching my house, or where they\u0027d watch it from, but if they saw Debbie\u0027s former fianc¨¦ tootling down my driveway, it would be easy to connect the dots and come up with a totally erroneous picture. They\u0027d think Alcide killed Debbie to clear the way for me, and nothing could be more wrong. I hoped like hell that Jack Leeds and Lily Bard Leeds were sound asleep rather than staked out in the woods somewhere with a pair of binoculars.\\n\\n Alcide hugged me. He always did. And once again I was overwhelmed by the size of him, the masculinity, the familiar smell. Despite the warning bell ringing in my head, I hugged him back.\\n\\n We sat on the couch and half turned to face each other. Alcide was wearing work clothes, which in this weather consisted of a flannel shirt worn open over a T-shirt, heavy jeans, and thick socks under his work boots. His tangle of black hair had a crease in it from his hard hat, and he was beginning to look a little bristly.\\n\\n \"Tell me about the detectives,\" he said, and I described the couple and told him what they\u0027d said.\\n\\n \"Debbie\u0027s family didn\u0027t say anything to me about it,\" Alcide said. He turned it over in his head for a minute. I could follow his thinking. \"I think that means they\u0027re sure I made her vanish.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe not. Maybe they just think you\u0027re so grieved they don\u0027t want to bring it up.\"\\n\\n \"Grieved.\" Alcide mulled that over for a minute. \"No. I spent all the...\" He paused, grappling for words. \"I used up all the energy I had to spare for her,\" he said finally. \"I was so blind, I almost think she used some kind of magic on me. Her mother\u0027s a spellcaster and half shifter. Her dad\u0027s a full-blooded shifter.\"\\n\\n \"You think that\u0027s possible? Magic?\" I wasn\u0027t questioning that magic existed, but that Debbie had used it.\\n\\n \"Why else would I stick with her for so long? Ever since she\u0027s gone missing, it\u0027s been like someone took a pair of dark glasses off my eyes. I was willing to forgive her so much, like when she pushed you into the trunk.\"\\n\\n Debbie had taken an opportunity to push me in a car trunk with my vampire boyfriend, Bill, who\u0027d been starved for blood for days. And she\u0027d walked off and left me in the trunk with Bill, who was about to awake.\\n\\n I looked down at my feet, pushing away the recollection of the desperation, the pain.\\n\\n \"She let you get raped,\" Alcide said harshly.\\n\\n Him saying it like that, flat out, shocked me. \"Hey, Bill didn\u0027t know it was me,\" I said. \"He hadn\u0027t had anything to eat for days and days, and the impulses are so closely related. I mean, he stopped, you know? He stopped, when he knew it was me.\" I couldn\u0027t put it like that to myself; I couldn\u0027t say that word. I knew beyond a doubt that Bill would rather have chewed off his own hand than done that to me if he\u0027d been in his right mind. At that time, he\u0027d been the only sex partner I\u0027d ever had. My feelings about the incident were so confused that I couldn\u0027t even bear to try to pick through them. When I\u0027d thought of rape before, when other girls had told me what had happened to them or I\u0027d read it in their brains, I hadn\u0027t had the ambiguity I felt over my own short, awful time in the trunk.\\n\\n \"He did something you didn\u0027t want him to do,\" Alcide said simply.\\n\\n \"He wasn\u0027t himself,\" I said.\\n\\n \"But he did it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he did, and I was awful scared.\" My voice began to shake. \"But he came to his senses, and he stopped, and I was okay, and he was really, really sorry. He\u0027s never laid a finger on me since then, never asked me if we could have sex, never...\" My voice trailed off. I stared down at my hands. \"Yes, Debbie was responsible for that.\" Somehow, saying that out loud made me feel better. \"She knew what would happen, or at least she didn\u0027t care what would happen.\"\\n\\n \"And even then,\" Alcide said, returning to his main point, \"she kept coming back and I kept trying to rationalize her behavior. I can\u0027t believe I would do that if I wasn\u0027t under some kind of magical influence.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t about to try to make Alcide feel guiltier. I had my own load of guilt to carry. \"Hey, it\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n \"You sound sure.\"\\n\\n I looked Alcide directly in the eyes. His were narrow and green. \"Do you think there\u0027s the slightest chance that Debbie\u0027s alive?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Her family...\" Alcide stopped. \"No, I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t get rid of Debbie Pelt, dead or alive.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027d you need to talk to me in the first place?\" I asked. \"You said over the phone you needed to tell me something.\"\\n\\n \"Colonel Flood died yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry! What happened?\"\\n\\n \"He was driving to the store when another driver hit him broadside.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s awful. Was anyone in the car with him?\"\\n\\n \"No, he was by himself. His kids are coming back to Shreveport for the funeral, of course. I wondered if you\u0027d come to the funeral with me.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. It\u0027s not private?\"\\n\\n \"No. He knew so many people still stationed at the Air Force base, and he was head of his Neighborhood Watch group and the treasurer of his church, and of course he was the packmaster.\"\\n\\n \"He had a big life,\" I said. \"Lots of responsibility.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s tomorrow at one. What\u0027s your work schedule?\"\\n\\n \"If I can swap shifts with someone, I\u0027d need to be back here at four thirty to change and go to work.\"\\n\\n \"That shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027ll be packmaster now?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Alcide said, but his voice wasn\u0027t as neutral as I\u0027d expected.\\n\\n \"Do you want the job?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" He seemed a little hesitant, I thought, and I felt the conflict in his head. \"But my father does.\" He wasn\u0027t finished. I waited.\\n\\n \"Were funerals are pretty ceremonial,\" he said, and I realized he was trying to tell me something. I just wasn\u0027t sure what it was.\\n\\n \"Spit it out.\" Straightforward is always good, as far as I\u0027m concerned.\\n\\n \"If you think you can overdress for this, you can\u0027t,\" he said. \"I know the rest of the shifter world thinks Weres only go for leather and chains, but that\u0027s not true. For funerals, we go all out.\" He wanted to give me even more fashion tips, but he stopped there. I could see the thoughts crowding right behind his eyes, wanting to be let out.\\n\\n \"Every woman wants to know what\u0027s appropriate to wear,\" I said. \"Thanks. I won\u0027t wear pants.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"I know you can do that, but I\u0027m always taken by surprise.\" I could hear that he was disconcerted. \"I\u0027ll pick you up at eleven thirty,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Let me see about swapping shifts.\"\\n\\n I called Holly and found it suited her to switch shifts with me. \"I can just drive over there and meet you,\" I offered.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll come get you and bring you back.\"\\n\\n Okay, if he wanted to go to the trouble of fetching me, I could live with it. I\u0027d save mileage on my car, I figured. My old Nova was none too reliable.\\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027ll be ready.\"\\n\\n \"I better go,\" he said. The silence drew out. I knew Alcide was thinking of kissing me. He leaned over and kissed me lightly on the lips. We regarded each other from a few inches apart.\\n\\n \"Well, I have some things I need to be doing, and you should be going back to Shreveport. I\u0027ll be ready at eleven thirty tomorrow.\"\\n\\n After Alcide left, I got my library book, Carolyn Haines\u0027s latest, and tried to forget my worries. But for once, a book just couldn\u0027t do the trick. I tried a hot soak in the bathtub, and I shaved my legs until they were perfectly smooth. I painted my toenails and fingernails a deep pink and then I plucked my eyebrows. Finally, I felt relaxed, and when I crawled into my bed I had achieved peace through pampering. Sleep came upon me in such a rush that I didn\u0027t finish my prayers. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-as-a-doornail-sookie-stackhouse-5/page-5.html","bookId":2195,"book":{"id":2195,"title":"Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5) \\n Small-town cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has had more than her share of experience with the supernatural—but now it’s really hitting close to home.
