{"id":101117,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"4\\n\\n THE DRIVE BACK to Bon Temps was pleasant. Vampires don\u0027t smell like humans or act like humans, but they\u0027re sure relaxing to my brain. Being with a vampire is almost as tension-free as being alone, except, of course, for the blood-sucking possibilities.\\n\\n Charles Twining asked a few questions about the work for which he\u0027d been hired and about the bar. My driving seemed to make him a little uneasy - though possibly his unease was due to simply being in a car. Some of the preÂ¨CIndustrial Revolution vamps loathe modern transportation. His eye patch was on his left eye, on my side, which gave me the curious feeling I was invisible.\\n\\n I\u0027d run him by the vampire hostel where he\u0027d been living so he could gather a few things. He had a sports bag with him, one large enough to hold maybe three days\u0027 worth of clothes. He\u0027d just moved into Shreveport, he told me, and hadn\u0027t had time to decide where he would settle.\\n\\n After we\u0027d been on our way for about forty minutes, the vampire said, \"And you, Miss Sookie? Do you live with your father and mother?\"\\n\\n \"No, they\u0027ve been gone since I was seven,\" I said. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a hand gesture inviting me to continue. \"There was a whole lot of rain in a real short time one night that spring, and my dad tried to cross a little bridge that had water already over it. They got swept away.\"\\n\\n I glanced to my right to see that he was nodding. People died, sometimes suddenly and unexpectedly, and sometimes for very little reason. A vampire knew that better than anyone. \"My brother and I grew up with my grandmother,\" I said. \"She died last year. My brother has my parents\u0027 old house, and I have my grandmother\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky to have a place to live,\" he commented.\\n\\n In profile, his hooked nose was an elegant miniature. I wondered if he cared that the human race had gotten larger, while he had stayed the same.\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" I agreed. \"I\u0027m major lucky. I\u0027ve got a job, I\u0027ve got my brother, I\u0027ve got a house, I\u0027ve got friends. And I\u0027m healthy.\"\\n\\n He turned to look at me full-face, I think, but I was passing a battered Ford pickup, so I couldn\u0027t return his gaze. \"That\u0027s interesting. Forgive me, but I was under the impression from Pam that you have some kind of disability.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well, yeah.\"\\n\\n \"And that would be...? You look very, ah, robust.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a telepath.\"\\n\\n He mulled that over. \"And that would mean?\"\\n\\n \"I can read other humans\u0027 minds.\"\\n\\n \"But not vampires.\"\\n\\n \"No, not vampires.\"\\n\\n \"Very good.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I think so.\" If I could read vampire minds, I\u0027d have been dead long ago. Vampires value their privacy.\\n\\n \"Did you know Chow?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" It was my turn to be terse.\\n\\n \"And Long Shadow?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"As the newest bartender at Fangtasia, I have a definite interest in their deaths.\"\\n\\n Understandable, but I had no idea how to respond. \"Okay,\" I said cautiously.\\n\\n \"Were you there when Chow died again?\" This was the way some vamps referred to the final death.\\n\\n \"Um... yes.\"\\n\\n \"And Long Shadow?\"\\n\\n \"Well... yes.\"\\n\\n \"I would be interested in hearing what you had to say.\"\\n\\n \"Chow died in what they\u0027re calling the Witch War. Long Shadow was trying to kill me when Eric staked him because he\u0027d been embezzling.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s why Eric staked him? For embezzling?\"\\n\\n \"I was there. I oughta know. End of subject.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose your life has been complicated,\" Charles said after a pause.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Where will I be spending the sunlight hours?\"\\n\\n \"My boss has a place for you.\"\\n\\n \"There is a lot of trouble at this bar?\"\\n\\n \"Not until recently.\" I hesitated.\\n\\n \"Your regular bouncer can\u0027t handle shifters?\"\\n\\n \"Our regular bouncer is the owner, Sam Merlotte. He is a shifter. Right now, he\u0027s a shifter with a broken leg. He got shot. And he\u0027s not the only one.\"\\n\\n This didn\u0027t seem to astonish the vampire. \"How many?\"\\n\\n \"Three that I know of. A werepanther named Calvin Norris, who wasn\u0027t mortally wounded, and then a shifter girl named Heather Kinman, who\u0027s dead. She was shot at the Sonic. Do you know what Sonic is?\" Vampires didn\u0027t always pay attention to fast-food restaurants, because they didn\u0027t eat. (Hey, how many blood banks can you locate off the top of your head?)\\n\\n Charles nodded, his curly chestnut hair bouncing on his shoulders. \"That\u0027s the one where you eat in your car?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, right,\" I said. \"Heather had been in a friend\u0027s car, talking, and she got out to walk back to her car a few slots down. The shot came from across the street. She had a milkshake in her hand.\" The melting chocolate ice cream had blended with blood on the pavement. I\u0027d seen it in Andy Bellefleur\u0027s mind. \"It was late at night, and all the businesses on the other side of the street had been closed for hours. So the shooter got away.\"\\n\\n \"All three shootings were at night?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder if that\u0027s significant.\"\\n\\n \"Could be; but maybe it\u0027s just that there\u0027s better concealment at night.\"\\n\\n Charles nodded.\\n\\n \"Since Sam got hurt, there\u0027s been a lot of anxiety among the shifters because it\u0027s hard to believe three shootings could be a coincidence. And regular humans are worried because in their view three people have been shot at random, people with nothing in common and few enemies. Since everyone\u0027s tense, there are more fights in the bar.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never been a bouncer before,\" Charles said conversationally. \"I was the youngest son of a minor baronet, so I\u0027ve had to make my own way, and I\u0027ve done many things. I\u0027ve worked as a bartender before, and many years ago I was shill for a whorehouse. Stood outside, trumpeted the wares of the strumpets - that\u0027s a neat phrase, isn\u0027t it? - threw out men who got too rough with the whores. I suppose that\u0027s the same as being a bouncer.\"\\n\\n I was speechless at this unexpected confidence.\\n\\n \"Of course, that was after I lost my eye, but before I became a vampire,\" the vampire said.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I echoed weakly.\\n\\n \"Which was while I was a pirate,\" he continued. He was smiling. I checked with a sideways glance.\\n\\n \"What did you, um, pirate?\" I didn\u0027t know if that was a verb or not, but he got my meaning clearly.\\n\\n \"Oh, we\u0027d try to catch almost anyone unawares,\" he said blithely. \"Off and on I lived on the coast of America, down close to New Orleans, where we\u0027d take small cargo ships and the like. I sailed aboard a small hoy, so we couldn\u0027t take on too large or well defended a ship. But when we caught up with some bark, then there was fighting!\" He sighed - recalling the happiness of whacking at people with a sword, I guess.\\n\\n \"And what happened to you?\" I asked politely, meaning how did he come to depart his wonderful warm-blooded life of rapine and slaughter for the vampire edition of the same thing.\\n\\n \"One evening, we boarded a galleon that had no living crew,\" he said. I noticed that his hands had curled into fists. His voice chilled. \"We had sailed to the Tortugas. It was dusk. I was first man to go down into the hold. What was in the hold got me first.\"\\n\\n After that little tale, we fell silent by mutual consent.\\n\\n Sam was on the couch in the living room of his trailer. Sam had had the double-wide anchored so it was at a right angle to the back of the bar. That way, at least he opened his front door to a view of the parking lot, which was better than looking at the back of the bar, with its large garbage bin between the kitchen door and the employees\u0027 entrance.\\n\\n \"Well, there you are,\" Sam said, and his tone was grumpy. Sam was never one for sitting still. Now that his leg was in a cast, he was fretting from the inactivity. What would he do during the next full moon? Would the leg be healed enough by then for him to change? If he changed, what would happen to the cast? I\u0027d known other injured shape-shifters before, but I hadn\u0027t been around for their recuperation, so this was new territory for me. \"I was beginning to think you\u0027d gotten lost on the way back.\" Sam\u0027s voice returned me to the here and now. It had a distinct edge.\\n\\n \" \u0027Gee, thanks, Sookie, I see you returned with a bouncer,\u0027 \" I said. \" \u0027I\u0027m so sorry you had to go through the humiliating experience of asking Eric for a favor on my behalf.\u0027 \" At that moment, I didn\u0027t care if he was my boss or not.\\n\\n Sam looked embarrassed.\\n\\n \"Eric agreed, then,\" he said. He nodded at the pirate.\\n\\n \"Charles Twining, at your service,\" said the vampire.\\n\\n Sam\u0027s eyes widened. \"Okay. I\u0027m Sam Merlotte, owner of the bar. I appreciate your coming to help us out here.\"\\n\\n \"I was ordered to do so,\" the vampire said coolly.\\n\\n \"So the deal you struck was room, board, and favor,\" Sam said to me. \"I owe Eric a favor.\" This was said in a tone that a kind person would describe as grudging.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I was mad now. \"You sent me to make a deal. I checked the terms with you! That\u0027s the deal I made. You asked Eric for a favor; now he gets a favor in return. No matter what you told yourself, that\u0027s what it boils down to.\"\\n\\n Sam nodded, though he didn\u0027t look happy. \"Also, I changed my mind. I think Mr. Twining, here, should stay with you.\"\\n\\n \"And why would you think that?\"\\n\\n \"The closet looked a little cramped. You have a light-tight place for vampires, right?\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t ask me if that was okay.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re refusing to do it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes! I\u0027m not the vampire hotel keeper!\"\\n\\n \"But you work for me, and he works for me...\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. And would you ask Arlene or Holly to put him up?\"\\n\\n Sam looked even more amazed. \"Well, no, but that\u0027s because - \" He stopped then.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t think of how to finish the sentence, can you?\" I snarled. \"Okay, buddy, I\u0027m out of here. I spent a whole evening putting myself in an embarrassing situation for you. And what do I get? No effing thanks!\"\\n\\n I stomped out of the double-wide. I didn\u0027t slam the door because I didn\u0027t want to be childish. Door slamming just isn\u0027t adult. Neither is whining. Okay, maybe stomping out isn\u0027t, either. But it was a choice between making an emphatic verbal exit or slapping Sam. Normally Sam was one of my favorite people in the world, but tonight... not.\\n\\n I was working the early shift for the next three days - not that I was sure I had a job anymore. When I got into Merlotte\u0027s at eleven the next morning, dashing to the employees\u0027 door through the pouring rain in my ugly but useful rain slicker, I was nearly sure that Sam would tell me to collect my last paycheck and hit the door. But he wasn\u0027t there. I had a moment of what I recognized as disappointment. Maybe I\u0027d been spoiling for another fight, which was odd.\\n\\n Terry Bellefleur was standing in for Sam again, and Terry was having a bad day. It wasn\u0027t a good idea to ask him questions or even to talk to him beyond the necessary relay of orders.\\n\\n Terry particularly hated rainy weather, I\u0027d noticed, and he also didn\u0027t like Sheriff Bud Dearborn. I didn\u0027t know the reason for either prejudice. Today, gray sheets of rain battered at the walls and roof, and Bud Dearborn was pontificating to five of his cronies over on the smoking side. Arlene caught my eye and widened her eyes to give me a warning.\\n\\n Though Terry was pale, and perspiring, he\u0027d zipped up the light jacket he often wore over his Merlotte\u0027s T-shirt. I noticed his hands shaking as he pulled a draft beer. I wondered if he could last until dark.\\n\\n At least there weren\u0027t many customers, if something did go wrong. Arlene drifted over to catch up with a married couple who\u0027d come in, friends of hers. My section was almost empty, with the exception of my brother, Jason, and his friend Hoyt.\\n\\n Hoyt was Jason\u0027s sidekick. If they weren\u0027t both definitely heterosexual, I would have recommended they marry, they complemented each other so well. Hoyt enjoyed jokes, and Jason enjoyed telling them. Hoyt was at a loss to fill his free time, and Jason was always up to something. Hoyt\u0027s mother was a little overwhelming, and Jason was parent-free. Hoyt was firmly anchored in the here and now, and had an iron sense of what the community would tolerate and what it would not. Jason didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I thought of what a huge secret Jason now had, and I wondered if he was tempted to share it with Hoyt.\\n\\n \"How you doing, Sis?\" Jason asked. He held up his glass, indicating he\u0027d like a refill on his Dr Pepper. Jason didn\u0027t drink until after his workday was over, a large point in his favor.\\n\\n \"Fine, Brother. You want some more, Hoyt?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Please, Sookie. Ice tea,\" Hoyt said.\\n\\n In a second I was back with their drinks. Terry glared at me when I went behind the bar, but he didn\u0027t speak. I can ignore a glare.\\n\\n \"Sook, you want to go with me to the hospital in Grainger this afternoon after you get off?\" Jason asked.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"Yeah, sure.\" Calvin had always been good to me.\\n\\n Hoyt said, \"Sure is crazy, Sam and Calvin and Heather getting shot. What do you make of it, Sookie?\" Hoyt has decided I am an oracle.\\n\\n \"Hoyt, you know as much about it as I do,\" I told him. \"I think we all should be careful.\" I hoped the significance of this wasn\u0027t lost on my brother. He shrugged.\\n\\n When I looked up, I saw a stranger waiting to be seated and hurried over to him. His dark hair, turned black by the rain, was pulled back in a ponytail. His face was scarred with one long thin white line that ran along one cheek. When he pulled off his jacket, I could see that he was a bodybuilder.\\n\\n \"Smoking or non?\" I asked, with a menu already in my hand.\\n\\n \"Non,\" he said, and followed me to a table. He carefully hung his wet jacket on the back of a chair and took the menu after he was seated. \"My wife will be along in a few minutes,\" he said. \"She\u0027s meeting me here.\"\\n\\n I put another menu at the adjacent place. \"Do you want to order now or wait for her?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like some hot tea,\" he asked. \"I\u0027ll wait until she comes to order food. Kind of a limited menu here, huh?\" He glanced over at Arlene and then back at me. I began to feel uneasy. I knew he wasn\u0027t here because this place was convenient for lunch.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all we can handle,\" I said, taking care to sound relaxed. \"What we\u0027ve got, it\u0027s good.\"\\n\\n When I assembled the hot water and a tea bag, I put a saucer with a couple of lemon slices on the tray, too. No fairies around to offend.\\n\\n \"Are you Sookie Stackhouse?\" he asked when I returned with his tea.\\n\\n \"Yes, I am.\" I put the saucer gently on the table, right beside the cup. \"Why do you want to know?\" I already knew why, but with regular people, you had to ask.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Jack Leeds, a private investigator,\" he said. He laid a business card on the table, turned so I could read it. He waited for a beat, as if he usually got a dramatic reaction to that statement. \"I\u0027ve been hired by a family in Jackson, Mississippi - the Pelt family,\" he continued, when he saw I wasn\u0027t going to speak.\\n\\n My heart sank to my shoes before it began pounding at an accelerated rate. This man believed that Debbie was dead. And he thought there was a good chance I might know something about it.\\n\\n He was absolutely right.\\n\\n I\u0027d shot Debbie Pelt dead a few weeks before, in self-defense. Hers was the body Eric had hidden. Hers was the bullet Eric had taken for me.\\n\\n Debbie\u0027s disappearance after leaving a \"party\" in Shreveport, Louisiana (in fact a life-and-death brawl between witches, vamps, and Weres), had been a nine days\u0027 wonder. I\u0027d hoped I\u0027d heard the end of it.\\n\\n \"So the Pelts aren\u0027t satisfied with the police investigation?\" I asked. It was a stupid question, one I picked out of the air at random. I had to say something to break up the gathering silence.\\n\\n \"There really wasn\u0027t an investigation,\" Jack Leeds said. \"The police in Jackson decided she probably vanished voluntarily.\" He didn\u0027t believe that, though.\\n\\n His face changed then; it was like someone had switched on a light behind his eyes. I turned to look where he was looking, and I saw a blond woman of medium height shaking her umbrella out at the door. She had short hair and pale skin, and when she turned, I saw that she was very pretty; at least, she would have been if she had been more animated.\\n\\n But that wasn\u0027t a factor to Jack Leeds. He was looking at the woman he loved, and when she saw him, the same light switched on behind her eyes, too. She came across the floor to his table as smoothly as if she were dancing, and when she shed her own wet jacket, I saw her arms were as muscular as his. They didn\u0027t kiss, but his hand slid over hers and squeezed just briefly. After she\u0027d taken her chair and asked for some diet Coke, her eyes went to the menu. She was thinking that all the food Merlotte\u0027s offered was unhealthy. She was right.\\n\\n \"Salad?\" Jack Leeds asked.\\n\\n \"I have to have something hot,\" she said. \"Chili?\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Two chilis,\" he told me. \"Lily, this is Sookie Stackhouse. Ms. Stackhouse, this is Lily Bard Leeds.\"\\n\\n \"Hello,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve just been out to your house.\"\\n\\n Her eyes were light blue, and she had a stare like a laser. \"You saw Debbie Pelt the night she disappeared.\" Her mind added, You\u0027re the one she hated so much.\\n\\n They didn\u0027t know Debbie Pelt\u0027s true nature, and I was relieved that the Pelts hadn\u0027t been able to find a Were investigator. They wouldn\u0027t out their daughter to regular detectives. The longer the two-natured could keep the fact of their existence a secret, the better, as far as they were concerned.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"I saw her that night.\"\\n\\n \"Can we come talk to you about that? After you get off work?\"\\n\\n \"I have to go see a friend in the hospital after work,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Sick?\" Jack Leeds asked.\\n\\n \"Shot,\" I said.\\n\\n Their interest quickened. \"By someone local?\" the blond woman asked.\\n\\n Then I saw how it might all work. \"By a sniper,\" I said. \"Someone\u0027s been shooting people at random in this area.\"\\n\\n \"Have any of them vanished?\" Jack Leeds asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" I admitted. \"They\u0027ve all been left lying. Of course, there were witnesses to all of the shootings. Maybe that\u0027s why.\" I hadn\u0027t heard of anyone actually seeing Calvin get shot, but someone had come along right afterward and called 911.\\n\\n Lily Leeds asked me if they could talk to me the next day before I went to work. I gave them directions to my house and told them to come at ten. I didn\u0027t think talking to them was a very good idea, but I didn\u0027t think I had much of a choice, either. I would become more of an object of suspicion if I refused to talk about Debbie.\\n\\n I found myself wishing I could call Eric tonight and tell him about Jack and Lily Leeds; worries shared are worries halved. But Eric didn\u0027t remember any of it. I wished that I could forget Debbie\u0027s death, too. It was awful to know something so heavy and terrible, to be unable to share it with a soul.\\n\\n I knew so many secrets, but almost none of them were my own. This secret of mine was a dark and bloody burden.\\n\\n Charles Twining was due to relieve Terry at full dark. Arlene was working late, since Danielle was attending her daughter\u0027s dance recital, and I was able to lighten my mood a little by briefing Arlene on the new bartender/bouncer. She was intrigued. We\u0027d never had an Englishman visit the bar, much less an Englishman with an eye patch.\\n\\n \"Tell Charles I said hi,\" I called as I began to put on my rain gear. After a couple of hours of sprinkling, the drops were beginning to come faster again.\\n\\n I splashed out to my car, the hood pulled well forward over my face. Just as I unlocked the driver\u0027s door and pulled it open, I heard a voice call my name. Sam was standing on crutches in the door of his trailer. He\u0027d added a roofed porch a couple of years before, so he wasn\u0027t getting wet, but he didn\u0027t need to be standing there, either. Slamming the car door shut, I leaped over puddles and across the stepping-stones. In a second or two, I was standing on his porch and dripping all over it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said.\\n\\n I stared at him. \"You should be,\" I said gruffly.\\n\\n \"Well, I am.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Good.\" I resolutely didn\u0027t ask him what he\u0027d done with the vampire.\\n\\n \"Anything happen over at the bar today?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. \"Well, the crowd was thin, to put it mildly. But...\" I started to tell him about the private detectives, but then I knew he\u0027d ask questions. And I might end up telling him the whole sorry story just for the relief of confessing to someone. \"I have to go, Sam. Jason\u0027s taking me to visit Calvin Norris in the hospital in Grainger.\"\\n\\n He looked at me. His eyes narrowed. The lashes were the same red-gold as his hair, so they showed up only when you were close to him. And I had no business at all thinking about Sam\u0027s eyelashes, or any other part of him, for that matter.\\n\\n \"I was a shit yesterday,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t have to tell you why.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess you do,\" I said, bewildered. \"Because I sure don\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n \"The point is, you know you can count on me.\"\\n\\n To get mad at me for no reason? To apologize afterward? \"You\u0027ve really confused me a lot lately,\" I said. \"But you\u0027ve been my friend for years, and I have a very high opinion of you.\" That sounded way too stilted, so I tried smiling. He smiled back, and a drop of rain fell off my hood and splashed on my nose, and the moment was over. I said, \"When do you think you\u0027ll get back to the bar?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try to come in tomorrow for a while,\" he said. \"At least I can sit in the office and work on the books, get some filing done.\"\\n\\n \"See you.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n And I dashed back to my car, feeling that my heart was much lighter than it had been before. Being at odds with Sam had felt wrong. I didn\u0027t realize how that wrongness had colored my thoughts until I was right with him again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-as-a-doornail-sookie-stackhouse-5/page-4.html","bookId":2195,"book":{"id":2195,"title":"Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5) \\n Small-town cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has had more than her share of experience with the supernaturalâbut now itâs really hitting close to home.
