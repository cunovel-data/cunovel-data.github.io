{"id":101124,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"12\\n\\n I LET MYSELF in with the key I\u0027d gotten from Sam. I was on the right side of a duplex, the mirror of the one next door presently occupied by Halleigh Robinson, the young schoolteacher dating Andy Bellefleur. I figured I was likely to have police protection at least part of the time, and Halleigh would be gone during most of the day, which was nice considering my late hours.\\n\\n The living room was small and contained a flowered couch, a low coffee table, and an armchair. The next room was the kitchen, which was tiny, of course. But it had a stove, a refrigerator, and a microwave. No dishwasher, but I\u0027d never had one. Two plastic chairs were tucked under a tiny table.\\n\\n After I\u0027d glanced at the kitchen I went through into the small hall that separated the larger (but still small) bedroom on the right from the smaller (tiny) bedroom and the bathroom on the left. At the end of the hall there was a door to the little back porch.\\n\\n This was a very basic accommodation, but it was quite clean. There was central heating and cooling, and the floors were level. I ran a hand around the windows. They fit well. Nice. I reminded myself I\u0027d have to keep the venetian blinds drawn down, since I had neighbors.\\n\\n I made up the double bed in the larger bedroom. I put my clothes away in the freshly painted chest of drawers. I started a list of other things I needed: a mop, a broom, a bucket, some cleaning products... those had been on the back porch. I\u0027d have to get my vacuum cleaner out of the house. It had been in the closet in the living room, so it should be fine. I\u0027d brought one of my phones to plug in over here, so I would have to arrange with the phone company for them to route calls to this address. I\u0027d loaded my television into my car, but I had to arrange for my cable to be hooked up here. I\u0027d have to call from Merlotte\u0027s. Since the fire, all my time was being absorbed with the mechanics of living.\\n\\n I sat on the hard couch, staring into space. I tried to think of something fun, something I could look forward to. Well, in two months, it\u0027d be sunbathing time. That made me smile. I enjoyed lying in the sun in a little bikini, timing myself carefully so I didn\u0027t burn. I loved the smell of coconut oil. I took pleasure in shaving my legs and removing most of my other body hair so I\u0027d look smooth as a baby\u0027s bottom. And I don\u0027t want to hear any lectures about how bad tanning is for you. That\u0027s my vice. Everybody gets one.\\n\\n More immediately, it was time to go to the library and get another batch of books; I\u0027d retrieved my last bagful while I was at the house, and I\u0027d spread them out on my tiny porch here so they\u0027d air out. So going to the library - that would be fun.\\n\\n Before I went to work, I decided I\u0027d cook myself something in my new kitchen. That necessitated a trip to the grocery store, which took longer than I\u0027d planned because I kept seeing staples I was sure I\u0027d need. Putting the groceries away in the duplex cabinets made me feel that I really lived there. I browned a couple of pork chops and put them in the oven, microwaved a potato, and heated some peas. When I had to work nights, I usually went to Merlotte\u0027s at about five, so my home meal on those days was a combination lunch and dinner.\\n\\n After I\u0027d eaten and cleaned up, I thought I just had time to drive down to visit Calvin in the Grainger hospital.\\n\\n The twins had not arrived to take up their post in the lobby again, if they were still keeping vigil. Dawson was still stationed outside Calvin\u0027s room. He nodded to me, gestured to me to stop while I was several feet away, and stuck his head in Calvin\u0027s room. To my relief, Dawson swung the door wide open for me to enter and even patted my shoulder as I went in.\\n\\n Calvin was sitting up in the padded chair. He clicked off the television as I came in. His color was better, his beard and hair were clean and trimmed, and he looked altogether more like himself. He was wearing pajamas of blue broadcloth. He still had a tube or two in, I saw. He actually tried to push himself up out of the chair.\\n\\n \"No, don\u0027t you dare get up!\" I pulled over a straight chair and sat in front of him. \"Tell me how you are.\"\\n\\n \"Glad to see you,\" he said. Even his voice was stronger. \"Dawson said you wouldn\u0027t take any help. Tell me who set that fire.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the strange thing, Calvin. I don\u0027t know why this man set the fire. His family came to see me...\" I hesitated, because Calvin was recuperating from his own brush with death, and he shouldn\u0027t have to worry about other stuff.\\n\\n But he said, \"Tell me what you\u0027re thinking,\" and he sounded so interested that I ended up relating everything to the wounded shifter: my doubts about the arsonist\u0027s motives, my relief that the damage could be repaired, my concern about the trouble between Eric and Charles Twining. And I told Calvin that the police here had learned of more clusters of sniper activity.\\n\\n \"That would clear Jason,\" I pointed out, and he nodded. I didn\u0027t push it.\\n\\n \"At least no one else has been shot,\" I said, trying to think of something positive to throw in with the dismal mix.\\n\\n \"That we know of,\" Calvin said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"That we know of. Maybe someone else has been shot, and no one\u0027s found \u0027em yet.\"\\n\\n I was astonished at the thought, and yet it made sense. \"How\u0027d you think of that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have nothing else to do,\" he said with a small smile. \"I don\u0027t read, like you do. I\u0027m not much one for television, except for sports.\" Sure enough, the station he\u0027d had on when I\u0027d entered had been ESPN.\\n\\n \"What do you do in your spare time?\" I asked out of sheer curiosity.\\n\\n Calvin was pleased I\u0027d asked him a personal question. \"I work pretty long hours at Norcross,\" he said. \"I like to hunt, though I\u0027d rather hunt at the full moon.\" In his panther body. Well, I could understand that. \"I like to fish. I love mornings when I can just sit in my boat on the water and not worry about a thing.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh,\" I said encouragingly. \"What else?\"\\n\\n \"I like to cook. We have shrimp boils sometimes, or we cook up a whole mess of catfish and we eat outside - catfish and hush puppies and slaw and watermelon. In the summer, of course.\"\\n\\n It made my mouth water just to think about it.\\n\\n \"In the winter, I work on the inside of my house. I go out and cut wood for the people in our community who can\u0027t cut their own. I\u0027ve always got something to do, seems like.\"\\n\\n Now I knew twice as much about Calvin Norris as I had.\\n\\n \"Tell me how you\u0027re recovering,\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve still got the damn IV in,\" he said, gesturing with his arm. \"Other than that, I\u0027m a lot better. We heal pretty good, you know.\"\\n\\n \"How are you explaining Dawson to the people from your work who come to visit?\" There were flower arrangements and bowls of fruit and even a stuffed cat crowding the level surfaces in the room.\\n\\n \"Just tell \u0027em he\u0027s my cousin here to make sure I won\u0027t get too wore out with visitors.\"\\n\\n I was pretty sure no one would question Dawson directly.\\n\\n \"I have to get to work,\" I said, catching a glimpse of the clock on the wall. I was oddly reluctant to leave. I\u0027d enjoyed having a regular conversation with someone. Little moments like these were rare in my life.\\n\\n \"Are you still worried about your brother?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" But I\u0027d made my mind up I wouldn\u0027t beg again. Calvin had heard me out the first time. There wasn\u0027t any need for a repeat.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re keeping an eye on him.\"\\n\\n I wondered if the watcher had reported to Calvin that Crystal was spending the night with Jason. Or maybe Crystal herself was the watcher? If so, she was certainly taking her job seriously. She was watching Jason about as close as he could be watched.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" I said. \"That\u0027s the best way to find out he didn\u0027t do it.\" I was relieved to hear Calvin\u0027s news, and the longer I pondered it, the more I realized I should have figured it out myself.\\n\\n \"Calvin, you take care.\" I rose to leave, and he held up his cheek. Rather reluctantly, I touched my lips to it.\\n\\n He was thinking that my lips were soft and that I smelled good. I couldn\u0027t help but smile as I left. Knowing someone simply finds you attractive is always a boost to the spirits.\\n\\n I drove back to Bon Temps and stopped by the library before I went to work. The Renard Parish library is an old ugly brown-brick building erected in the thirties. It looks every minute of its age. The librarians had made many justified complaints about the heating and cooling, and the electrical wiring left a lot to be desired. The library\u0027s parking lot was in bad shape, and the old clinic next door, which had opened its doors in 1918, now had boarded-up windows - always a depressing sight. The long-closed clinic\u0027s overgrown lot looked more like a jungle than a part of downtown.\\n\\n I had allotted myself ten minutes to exchange my books. I was in and out in eight. The library parking lot was almost empty, since it was just before five o\u0027clock. People were shopping at Wal-Mart or already home cooking supper.\\n\\n The winter light was fading. I was not thinking about anything in particular, and that saved my life. In the nick of time, I identified intense excitement pulsing from another brain, and reflexively I ducked, feeling a sharp shove in my shoulder as I did so, and then a hot lance of blinding pain, and then wetness and a big noise. This all happened so fast I could not definitely sequence it when I later tried to reconstruct the moment.\\n\\n A scream came from behind me, and then another. Though I didn\u0027t know how it had happened, I found myself on my knees beside my car, and blood was spattered over the front of my white T-shirt.\\n\\n Oddly, my first thought was Thank God I didn\u0027t have my new coat on.\\n\\n The person who\u0027d screamed was Portia Bellefleur. Portia was not her usual collected self as she skidded across the parking lot to crouch beside me. Her eyes went one way, then another, as she tried to spot danger coming from any direction.\\n\\n \"Hold still,\" she said sharply, as though I\u0027d proposed running a marathon. I was still on my knees, but keeling over appeared to be a pleasant option. Blood was trickling down my arm. \"Someone shot you, Sookie. Oh my God, oh my God.\"\\n\\n \"Take the books,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t want to get blood on the books. I\u0027ll have to pay for them.\"\\n\\n Portia ignored me. She was talking into her cell phone. People talked on their phones at the damnedest times! In the library, for goodness\u0027s sake, or at the optometrist. Or in the bar. Jabber, jabber, jabber. As if everything was so important it couldn\u0027t wait. So I put the books on the ground beside me all by myself.\\n\\n Instead of kneeling, I found myself sitting, my back against my car. And then, as if someone had taken a slice out of my life, I discovered I was lying on the pavement of the library parking lot, staring at someone\u0027s big old oil stain. People should take better care of their cars....\\n\\n Out.\\n\\n \"Wake up,\" a voice was saying. I wasn\u0027t in the parking lot, but in a bed. I thought my house was on fire again, and Claudine was trying to get me out. People were always trying to get me out of bed. Though this didn\u0027t sound like Claudine; this sounded more like...\\n\\n \"Jason?\" I tried to open my eyes. I managed to peer through my barely parted lids to identify my brother. I was in a dimly lit blue room, and I hurt so bad I wanted to cry.\\n\\n \"You got shot,\" he said. \"You got shot, and I was at Merlotte\u0027s, waiting for you to get there.\"\\n\\n \"You sound... happy,\" I said through lips that felt oddly thick and stiff. Hospital.\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t have done it! I was with people the whole time! I had Hoyt in the truck with me from work to Merlotte\u0027s, because his truck\u0027s in the shop. I am covered.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, good. I\u0027m glad I got shot, then. As long as you\u0027re okay.\" It was such an effort to say it, I was glad when Jason picked up on the sarcasm.\\n\\n \"Yeah, hey, I\u0027m sorry about that. At least it wasn\u0027t serious.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"I forgot to tell you. Your shoulder got creased, and it\u0027s going to hurt for a while. Press this button if it hurts. You can give yourself pain medication. Cool, huh? Listen, Andy\u0027s outside.\"\\n\\n I pondered that, finally deduced Andy Bellefleur was there in his official capacity. \"Okay,\" I said. \"He can come in.\" I stretched out a finger and carefully pushed the button.\\n\\n I blinked then, and it must have been a long blink, because when I pried my eyes open again, Jason was gone and Andy was in his place, a little notebook and a pen in his hands. There was something I had to tell him, and after a moment\u0027s reflection, I knew what it was.\\n\\n \"Tell Portia I said thank you,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"I will,\" he said seriously. \"She\u0027s pretty shook up. She\u0027s never been that close to violence before. She thought you were gonna die.\"\\n\\n I could think of nothing to say to that. I waited for him to ask me what he wanted to know. His mouth moved, and I guess I answered him.\\n\\n \"... said you ducked at the last second?\"\\n\\n \"I heard something, I guess,\" I whispered. That was the truth, too. I just hadn\u0027t heard something with my ears.... But Andy knew what I meant, and he was a believer. His eyes met mine and widened.\\n\\n And out again. The ER doctor had certainly given me some excellent painkiller. I wondered which hospital I was in. The one in Clarice was a little closer to the library; the one in Grainger had a higher-rated ER. If I was in Grainger, I might as well have saved myself the time driving back to Bon Temps and going to the library. I could have been shot right in the hospital parking lot when I left from visiting Calvin, and that would have saved me the trip.\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" said a quiet, familiar voice. It was cool and dark, like water running in a stream on a moonless night.\\n\\n \"Bill,\" I said, feeling happy and safe. \"Don\u0027t go.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be right here.\"\\n\\n And he was there, reading, in a chair by my bed when I woke up at three in the morning. I could feel the minds in the rooms around me all shut down in sleep. But the brain in the head of the man next to me was a blank. At that moment, I realized that the person who\u0027d shot me had not been a vampire, though all the shootings had taken place at dusk or full dark. I\u0027d heard the shooter\u0027s brain in the second before the shot, and that had saved my life.\\n\\n Bill looked up the instant I moved. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked.\\n\\n I pushed the button to raise the head of the bed. \"Like hell warmed over,\" I said frankly after evaluating my shoulder. \"My pain stuff has lapsed, and my shoulder aches like it\u0027s going to fall off. My mouth feels like an army has marched through it, and I need to go to the bathroom in the worst way.\"\\n\\n \"I can help you take care of that,\" he said, and before I could get embarrassed, he\u0027d moved the IV pole around the bed and helped me up. I stood cautiously, gauging how steady my legs were. He said, \"I won\u0027t let you fall.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said, and we started across the floor to the bathroom. When he got me settled on the toilet, he tactfully stepped out, but left the door cracked while he waited just outside. I managed everything awkwardly, but I became profoundly aware I was lucky I\u0027d been shot in my left shoulder instead of my right. Of course, the shooter must have been aiming for my heart.\\n\\n Bill got me back into the bed as deftly as if he\u0027d been nursing people all his life. He\u0027d already smoothed the bed and shaken the pillows, and I felt much more comfortable. But the shoulder continued to nag me, and I pressed the pain button. My mouth was dry, and I asked Bill if there was water in the plastic pitcher. Bill pressed the Nurse button. When her tinny voice came over the intercom, Bill said, \"Some water for Miss Stackhouse,\" and the voice squawked back that she\u0027d be right down. She was, too. Bill\u0027s presence might have had something to do with her speed. People might have accepted the reality of vampires, but that didn\u0027t meant they liked undead Americans. Lots of middle-class Americans just couldn\u0027t relax around vamps. Which was smart of them, I thought.\\n\\n \"Where are we?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Grainger,\" he said. \"I get to sit with you in a different hospital this time.\" Last time, I\u0027d been in Renard Parish Hospital in Clarice.\\n\\n \"You can go down the hall and visit Calvin.\"\\n\\n \"If I had any interest in doing so.\"\\n\\n He sat on the bed. Something about the deadness of the hour, the strangeness of the night, made me feel like being frank. Maybe it was just the drugs.\\n\\n \"I never was in a hospital till I knew you,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Do you blame me?\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes.\" I watched his face glow. Other people didn\u0027t always know a vamp when they saw one; that was hard for me to understand.\\n\\n \"When I met you, that first night I came into Merlotte\u0027s, I didn\u0027t know what to think of you,\" he said. \"You were so pretty, so full of vitality. And I could tell there was something different about you. You were interesting.\"\\n\\n \"My curse,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Or your blessing.\" He put one of his cool hands on my cheek. \"No fever,\" he said to himself. \"You\u0027ll heal.\" Then he sat up straighter. \"You slept with Eric while he was staying with you.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you asking, if you already know?\" There was such a thing as too much honesty.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking. I knew when I saw you together. I smelled him all over you; I could tell how you felt about him. We\u0027ve had each other\u0027s blood. It\u0027s hard to resist Eric,\" Bill went on in a detached way. \"He\u0027s as vital as you are, and you share a zest for life. But I\u0027m sure you know that...\" He paused, seemed to be trying to think how to frame what he wanted to say.\\n\\n \"I know that you\u0027d be happy if I never slept with anyone else in my life,\" I said, putting his thoughts into words for him.\\n\\n \"And how do you feel about me?\"\\n\\n \"The same. Oh, but wait, you already did sleep with someone else. Before we even broke up.\" Bill looked away, the line of his jaw like granite. \"Okay, that\u0027s water under the bridge. No, I don\u0027t want to think about you with Selah, or with anyone. But my head knows that\u0027s unreasonable.\"\\n\\n \"Is it unreasonable to hope that we\u0027ll be together again?\"\\n\\n I considered the circumstances that had turned me against Bill. I thought of his infidelity with Lorena; but she had been his maker, and he had had to obey her. Everything I\u0027d heard from other vamps had confirmed what he\u0027d told me about that relationship. I thought of his near-rape of me in the trunk of a car; but he\u0027d been starved and tortured, and hadn\u0027t known what he was doing. The minute he\u0027d come to his senses, he\u0027d stopped.\\n\\n I remembered how happy I\u0027d been when I\u0027d had what I thought was his love. I\u0027d never felt more secure in my life. How false a feeling that had been: He\u0027d become so absorbed in his work for the Queen of Louisiana that I\u0027d begun to come in a distant second. Out of all the vampires who could have walked into Merlotte\u0027s Bar, I\u0027d gotten the workaholic.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if we can ever have the same relationship again,\" I said. \"It might be possible, when I\u0027m a little less raw from the pain of it. But I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here tonight, and I wish you would lie down with me for a little while... if you want to.\" I moved over on the narrow bed and turned on my right side, so the wounded shoulder was up. Bill lay down behind me and put his arm over me. No one could approach me without him knowing. I felt perfectly secure, absolutely safe, and cherished. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here,\" I mumbled as the medicine kicked in. As I was drifting off to sleep again, I remembered my New Year\u0027s Eve resolution: I wanted not to get beaten up. Note to self: I should have included \"shot.\"\\n\\n I was released the next morning. When I went to the business office, the clerk, whose name tag read MS. BEESON, said, \"It\u0027s already been taken care of.\"\\n\\n \"By who?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"The person wishes to remain anonymous,\" the clerk said, her round brown face set in a way that implied I shouldn\u0027t look gift horses in the mouth.\\n\\n This made me uneasy, very uneasy. I actually had the money in the bank to pay the whole bill, instead of sending a check each month. And nothing comes without a price. There were some people to whom I just didn\u0027t want to be beholden. When I absorbed the total at the bottom of the bill, I was shocked to find how very beholden I\u0027d be.\\n\\n Maybe I should have stayed in the office longer and argued with Ms. Beeson more forcefully, but I just didn\u0027t feel up to it. I wanted to shower, or at least bathe - something more thorough than the high-spots scrub I\u0027d given myself (very slowly and carefully) that morning. I wanted to eat my own food. I wanted some solitude and peace. So I got back in the wheelchair and let the aide wheel me out of the main entrance. I felt like the biggest idiot when it occurred to me that I didn\u0027t have a way home. My car was still in the library parking lot in Bon Temps - not that I was supposed to drive it for a couple of days.\\n\\n Just as I was about to ask the aide to wheel me back inside so I could ride up to Calvin\u0027s room (maybe Dawson could give me a lift), a sleek red Impala came to a halt in front of me. Claudine\u0027s brother, Claude, leaned over to push open the passenger door. I sat gaping at him. He said irritably, \"Well, are you going to get in?\"\\n\\n \"Wow,\" muttered the aide. \"Wow.\" I thought her blouse buttons were going to pop open, she was breathing so hard.\\n\\n I\u0027d met Claudine\u0027s brother Claude only once before. I\u0027d forgotten what an impact he made. Claude was absolutely breathtaking, so lovely that his proximity made me tense as a high wire. Relaxing around Claude was like trying to be nonchalant with Brad Pitt.\\n\\n Claude had been a stripper on ladies\u0027 night at Hooligans, a club in Monroe, but lately he\u0027d not only moved into managing the club, he\u0027d also branched into print and runway modeling. The opportunities for such work were few and far between in northern Louisiana, so Claude (according to Claudine) had decided to compete for Mr. Romance at a romance readers\u0027 convention. He\u0027d even had his ears surgically altered so they weren\u0027t pointed anymore. The big payoff was the chance to appear on a romance cover. I didn\u0027t know too much about the contest, but I knew what I saw when I looked at Claude. I felt pretty confident Claude would win by acclamation.\\n\\n Claudine had mentioned that Claude had just broken up with his boyfriend, too, so he was unattached: all six feet of him, accessorized with rippling black hair and rippling muscles and a six-pack that could have been featured in Abs Weekly. Mentally add to that a pair of brown velour-soft eyes, a chiseled jaw, and a sensuous mouth with a pouty bottom lip, and you\u0027ve got Claude. Not that I was noticing.\\n\\n Without the help of the aide, who was still saying, \"Wow, wow, wow,\" very quietly, I got out of the wheelchair and eased myself into the car. \"Thanks,\" I said to Claude, trying not to sound as astonished as I felt.\\n\\n \"Claudine couldn\u0027t get off work, so she called me and woke me up so I\u0027d be here to chauffeur you,\" Claude said, sounding totally put out.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m grateful for the ride,\" I said, after considering several possible responses.\\n\\n I noticed that Claude didn\u0027t have to ask me for directions to Bon Temps, though I\u0027d never seen him in the area - and I think I\u0027ve made the point that he was hard to miss.\\n\\n \"How is your shoulder?\" he said abruptly, as if he\u0027d remembered that was the polite question to ask.\\n\\n \"On the mend,\" I said. \"And I have a prescription for some painkillers to fill.\"\\n\\n \"So I guess you need to do that, too?\"\\n\\n \"Um, well, that would be nice, since I\u0027m not supposed to drive for another day or two.\"\\n\\n When we reached Bon Temps, I directed Claude to the pharmacy, where he found a parking slot right in front. I managed to get out of the car and take in the prescription, since Claude didn\u0027t offer. The pharmacist, of course, had heard what had happened already and wanted to know what this world was coming to. I couldn\u0027t tell him.\\n\\n I passed the time while he was filling my prescription by speculating on the possibility that Claude was bisexual - even a little bit? Every woman who came into the pharmacy had a glazed look on her face. Of course, they hadn\u0027t had the privilege of having an actual conversation with Claude, so they hadn\u0027t had the benefit of his sparkling personality.\\n\\n \"Took you long enough,\" Claude said as I got back in the car.\\n\\n \"Yes, Mr. Social Skills,\" I snapped. \"I\u0027ll try to hurry from now on. Why should getting shot slow me down? I apologize.\"\\n\\n Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Claude\u0027s cheeks reddening.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said stiffly. \"I was abrupt. People tell me I\u0027m rude.\"\\n\\n \"No! Really?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he admitted, and then realized I\u0027d been a tad sarcastic. He gave me a look I would have called a glower from a less beautiful creature. \"Listen, I have a favor to ask you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re certainly off to a good start. You\u0027ve softened me up now.\"\\n\\n \"Would you stop that? I know I\u0027m not... not...\"\\n\\n \"Polite? Minimally courteous? Gallant? Going about this the right way?\"\\n\\n \"Sookie!\" he bellowed. \"Be quiet!\"\\n\\n I wanted one of my pain pills. \"Yes, Claude?\" I said in a quiet, reasonable voice.\\n\\n \"The people running the pageant want a portfolio. I\u0027ll go to the studio in Ruston for some glamour shots, but I think it might be a good idea to do some posed pictures, too. Like the covers of the books Claudine is always reading. Claudine says I should have a blonde pose with me, since I\u0027m dark. I thought of you.\"\\n\\n I guess if Claude had told me he wanted me to have his baby I could have been more surprised, but only just. Though Claude was the surliest man I\u0027d ever encountered, Claudine had a habit of saving my life. For her sake, I wanted to oblige.\\n\\n \"Would I need, like, a costume?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. But the photographer also does amateur dramatics and he rents out Halloween costumes, so he thought he might have some things that would do. What size do you wear?\"\\n\\n \"An eight.\" Sometimes more like a ten. But then again, once in a blue moon, a six, okay?\\n\\n \"So when can you do this?\"\\n\\n \"My shoulder has to heal,\" I said gently. \"The bandage wouldn\u0027t look good in the pictures.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, right. So you\u0027ll call me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t forget?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m so looking forward to it.\" Actually, at the moment what I wanted was my own space, free and clear of any other person, and a Diet Coke, and one of the pills I was clutching in my hand. Maybe I\u0027d have a little nap before I took the shower that also featured on my list.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve met the cook at Merlotte\u0027s before,\" Claude said, the floodgates evidently now wide open.\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Sweetie.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what she\u0027s calling herself? She used to work at the Foxy Femmes.\"\\n\\n \"She was a stripper?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, until the accident.\"\\n\\n \"Sweetie was in an accident?\" I was getting more worn out by the second.\\n\\n \"Yeah, so she got scarred and didn\u0027t want to strip anymore. It would\u0027ve required too much makeup, she said. Besides, by then she was getting a little on the, ah, old side to be stripping.\"\\n\\n \"Poor thing,\" I said. I tried to picture Sweetie parading down a runway in high heels and feathers. Disturbing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d never let her hear you say that,\" he advised.\\n\\n We parked in front of the duplex. Someone had brought my car back from the library parking lot. The door to the other side of the duplex opened, and Halleigh Robinson stepped out, my keys in her hand. I was wearing the black pants I\u0027d had on since I had been on my way to work, but my Merlotte\u0027s T-shirt had been ruined so the hospital had given me a white sweatshirt that someone had left there once upon a time. It was huge on me, but that wasn\u0027t why Halleigh was standing stock-still, catching flies with her mouth. Claude had actually gotten out to help me into the house, and the sight of him had paralyzed the young schoolteacher.\\n\\n Claude eased his arm tenderly around my shoulders, bent his head to look adoringly into my face, and winked.\\n\\n This was the first hint I\u0027d had that Claude had a sense of humor. It pleased me to find he wasn\u0027t universally disagreeable.\\n\\n \"Thanks for bringing me my keys,\" I called, and Halleigh suddenly remembered she could walk.\\n\\n \"Um,\" she said. \"Um, sure.\" She put the keys somewhere in the vicinity of my hand, and I snagged them.\\n\\n \"Halleigh, this is my friend Claude,\" I said with what I hoped was a meaningful smile.\\n\\n Claude moved his arm down to circle my waist and gave her a distracted smile of his own, hardly moving his eyes from mine. Oh, brother. \"Hello, Halleigh,\" he said in his richest baritone.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re lucky to have someone to bring you home from the hospital,\" Halleigh said. \"That\u0027s very nice of you, uh, Claude.\"\\n\\n \"I would do anything for Sookie,\" Claude said softly.\\n\\n \"Really?\" Halleigh shook herself. \"Well, how nice. Andy drove your car back over here, Sookie, and he asked if I\u0027d give you your keys. It\u0027s lucky you caught me. I just ran home to eat lunch. I, um, I have to go back to...\" She gave Claude a final comprehensive stare before getting into her own little Mazda to drive back to the elementary school.\\n\\n I unlocked my door clumsily and stepped into my little living room. \"This is where I\u0027m staying while my house is being rebuilt,\" I told Claude. I felt vaguely embarrassed at the small sterile room. \"I just moved in the day I got shot. Yesterday,\" I said with some wonder.\\n\\n Claude, his faux admiration having been dropped when Halleigh pulled away, eyed me with some disparagement. \"You have mighty bad luck,\" he observed.\\n\\n \"In some ways,\" I said. But I thought of all the help I\u0027d already gotten, and of my friends. I remembered the simple pleasure of sleeping close to Bill the night before. \"My luck could definitely be worse,\" I added, more or less to myself.\\n\\n Claude was massively uninterested in my philosophy.\\n\\n After I thanked him again and asked him to give Claudine a hug from me, I repeated my promise to call him when my wound had healed enough for the posing session.\\n\\n My shoulder was beginning to ache now. When I locked the door behind him, I swallowed a pill. I\u0027d called the phone company from the library the afternoon before, and to my surprise and pleasure I got a dial tone when I picked up my phone. I called Jason\u0027s cell to tell him I was out of the hospital, but he didn\u0027t answer so I left a message on his voice mail. Then I called the bar to tell Sam I\u0027d be back at work the next day. I\u0027d missed two days\u0027 worth of pay and tips, and I couldn\u0027t afford any more.\\n\\n I stretched out on the bed and took a long nap.\\n\\n When I woke up, the sky was darkening in a way that meant rain. In the front yard of the house across the street, a small maple was whipping around in an alarming way. I thought of the tin roof my Gran had loved and of the clatter the rain made when it hit the hard surface. Rain here in town was sure to be quieter.\\n\\n I was looking out my bedroom window at the identical duplex next door, wondering who my neighbor was, when I heard a sharp knock. Arlene was breathless from running through the first drops of rain. She had a bag from Wendy\u0027s in her hand, and the smell of the food made my stomach wake up with a growl.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have time to cook you anything,\" she said apologetically as I stood aside to let her in. \"But I remembered you liked to get the double hamburger with bacon when you were feeling low, and I figured you\u0027d be feeling pretty low.\"\\n\\n \"You figured right,\" I said, though I was discovering I was much better than I\u0027d been that morning. I went to the kitchen to get a plate, and Arlene followed, her eyes going to every corner.\\n\\n \"Hey, this is nice!\" she said. Though it looked barren to me, my temporary home must have looked wonderfully uncluttered to her.\\n\\n \"What was it like?\" Arlene asked. I tried not to hear that she was thinking that I got into more trouble than anyone she knew. \"You must have been so scared!\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" I was serious, and my voice showed it. \"I was very scared.\"\\n\\n \"The whole town is talking about it,\" Arlene said artlessly. That was just what I wanted to hear: that I was the subject of many conversations. \"Hey, you remember that Dennis Pettibone?\"\\n\\n \"The arson expert?\" I said. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got a date tomorrow night.\"\\n\\n \"Way to go, Arlene. What are you all gonna do?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re taking the kids to the roller rink in Grainger. He\u0027s got a girl, Katy. She\u0027s thirteen.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that sounds like fun.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s on stakeout tonight,\" Arlene said importantly.\\n\\n I blinked. \"What\u0027s he staking out?\"\\n\\n \"They needed all the officers they could call in. They\u0027re staking out different parking lots around town to see if they can catch this sniper in the act.\"\\n\\n I could see a flaw in their plan. \"What if the sniper sees them first?\"\\n\\n \"These are professionally trained men, Sookie. I think they know how to handle this.\" Arlene looked, and sounded, quite huffy. All of a sudden, she was Ms. Law Enforcement.\\n\\n \"Chill,\" I said. \"I\u0027m just concerned.\" Besides, unless the lawmen were Weres, they weren\u0027t in danger. Of course, the big flaw in that theory was that I had been shot. And I was no Were, no shifter. I still hadn\u0027t figured out how to work that into my scenario.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the mirror?\" Arlene asked, and I looked around.\\n\\n \"I guess the only big one\u0027s in the bathroom,\" I said, and it felt strange to have to think about the location of an item in my own place. While Arlene fussed with her hair, I put my food on a plate, hoping I\u0027d get to eat while it was still warm. I caught myself standing like a fool with the empty food bag in my hand, wondering where the garbage can was. Of course there wasn\u0027t a garbage can until I went out to buy one. I\u0027d never lived anywhere but my Gran\u0027s house for the past nineteen years. I\u0027d never had to start housekeeping from the ground up.\\n\\n \"Sam\u0027s still not driving, so he can\u0027t come to see you, but he\u0027s thinking about you,\" Arlene called. \"You gonna be able to work tomorrow night?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m planning on it.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027m scheduled to be off, Charlsie\u0027s granddaughter\u0027s in the hospital with pneumonia, so she\u0027s gone, and Holly doesn\u0027t always show up when she\u0027s scheduled. Danielle\u0027s going to be out of town. That new girl, Jada - she\u0027s better than Danielle, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"You think?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Arlene snorted. \"I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve noticed, but Danielle just doesn\u0027t seem to care anymore. People can be wanting drinks and calling to her, and it doesn\u0027t make a smidge of difference to her. She\u0027ll just stand there talking to her boyfriend while people holler at her.\"\\n\\n It was true that Danielle had been less than scrupulous about her work habits since she\u0027d started steady-dating a guy from Arcadia. \"You think she\u0027s gonna quit?\" I asked, and that opened up another conversational pit we mined for about five minutes, though Arlene had said she was in a hurry. She\u0027d ordered me to eat while the food was good, so I chewed and swallowed while she talked. We didn\u0027t say anything startlingly new or original, but we had a good time. I could tell that Arlene (for once) was just enjoying sitting with me, being idle.\\n\\n One of the many downsides to telepathy is the fact that you can tell the difference between when someone\u0027s really listening to you, and when you\u0027re talking to just a face instead of a mind.\\n\\n Andy Bellefleur arrived as Arlene was getting into her car. I was glad I\u0027d stuffed the bag from Wendy\u0027s in a cabinet just to get it out of the way.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right next to Halleigh,\" Andy said - an obvious opening gambit.\\n\\n \"Thanks for leaving my keys with her and getting my car over here,\" I said. Andy had his moments.\\n\\n \"She says the guy that brought you home from the hospital was really, ah, interesting.\" Andy was obviously fishing. I smiled at Andy. Whatever Halleigh had said had made him curious and maybe a little jealous.\\n\\n \"You could say that,\" I agreed.\\n\\n He waited to see if I\u0027d expound. When I didn\u0027t, he became all business.\\n\\n \"The reason I\u0027m here, I wanted to find out if you remembered any more about yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"Andy, I didn\u0027t know anything then, much less now.\"\\n\\n \"But you ducked.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Andy,\" I said, exasperated, since he knew good and well about my condition, \"you don\u0027t have to ask why I ducked.\"\\n\\n He turned red, slowly and unbecomingly. Andy was a fireplug of a man and an intelligent police detective, but he had such ambiguity toward things he knew to be true, even if those things weren\u0027t completely conventional items of common knowledge.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re here all by ourselves,\" I pointed out. \"And the walls are thick enough that I don\u0027t hear Halleigh moving around.\"\\n\\n \"Is there more?\" he asked suddenly, his eyes alight with curiosity. \"Sookie, is there more?\"\\n\\n I knew exactly what he meant. He would never spell it out, but he wanted to know if there was even more in this world than humans, and vampires, and telepaths. \"So much more,\" I said, keeping my voice quiet and even. \"Another world.\"\\n\\n Andy\u0027s eyes met mine. His suspicions had been confirmed, and he was intrigued. He was right on the edge of asking me about the people who\u0027d been shot - right on the verge of making the leap - but at the last instant, he drew back. \"You didn\u0027t see anything or hear anything that would help us? Was there anything different about the night Sam was shot?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"Nothing. Why?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer, but I could read his mind like a book. The bullet from Sam\u0027s leg didn\u0027t match the other recovered bullets.\\n\\n After he left, I tried to dissect that quick impression I\u0027d gotten, the one that had prompted me to duck. If the parking lot hadn\u0027t been empty, I might not have caught it at all, since the brain that had made it had been at some distance. And what I\u0027d felt had been a tangle of determination, anger, and above all, disgust. The person who\u0027d been shooting had been sure I was loathsome and inhuman. Stupidly enough, my first reaction was hurt - after all, no one likes to be despised. Then I considered the strange fact that Sam\u0027s bullet didn\u0027t match any of the previous Were shootings. I couldn\u0027t understand that at all. I could think of many explanations, but all of them seemed far-fetched.\\n\\n The rain began to pour down outside, hitting the north-facing windows with a hiss. I didn\u0027t have a reason to call anyone, but I felt like making one up. It wasn\u0027t a good night to be out of touch. As the pounding of the rain increased, I became more and more anxious. The sky was a leaden gray; soon it would be full dark.\\n\\n I wondered why I was so twitchy. I was used to being by myself, and it seldom bothered me. Now I was physically closer to people than I\u0027d ever been in my house on Hummingbird Road, but I felt more alone.\\n\\n Though I wasn\u0027t supposed to drive, I needed things for the duplex. I would have made the errand a necessity and gone to Wal-Mart despite the rain - or because of the rain - if the nurse hadn\u0027t made such a big deal out of resting my shoulder. I went restlessly from room to room until the crunch of gravel told me that I was having yet more company. This was town living, for sure.\\n\\n When I opened the door, Tara was standing there in a leopard-print raincoat with a hood. Of course I asked her in, and she tried her best to shake out the coat on the little front porch. I carried it into the kitchen to drip on the linoleum.\\n\\n She hugged me very gently and said, \"Tell me how you are.\"\\n\\n After I went over the story once again, she said, \"I\u0027ve been worried about you. I couldn\u0027t get away from the shop until now, but I just had to come see you. I saw the suit in my closet. Did you come to my house?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"The day before yesterday. Didn\u0027t Mickey tell you?\"\\n\\n \"He was in the house when you were there? I warned you,\" she said, almost panic-stricken. \"He didn\u0027t hurt you, did he? He didn\u0027t have anything to do with you getting shot?\"\\n\\n \"Not that I know of. But I did go into your house kind of late, and I know you told me not to. It was just dumb. He did, ah, try to scare me. I wouldn\u0027t let him know you\u0027ve been to see me, if I were you. How were you able to come here tonight?\"\\n\\n A shutter dropped over Tara\u0027s face. Her big dark eyes hardened, and she pulled away from me. \"He\u0027s out somewhere,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Tara, can you tell me how you came to be involved with him? What happened to Franklin?\" I tried to ask these questions as gently as I could, because I knew I was treading on delicate ground.\\n\\n Tara\u0027s eyes filled with tears. She was struggling to answer me, but she was ashamed. \"Sookie,\" she began at last, almost whispering, \"I thought Franklin really cared about me, you know? I mean, I thought he respected me. As a person.\"\\n\\n I nodded, intent on her face. I was scared of disrupting the flow of her story now that she\u0027d finally begun to talk to me.\\n\\n \"But he... he just passed me along when he was through with me.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no, Tara! He... surely he explained to you why you two were breaking up. Or did you have a big fight?\" I didn\u0027t want to believe Tara had been passed from vamp to vamp like some fang-banger at a bloodsucker\u0027s party.\\n\\n \"He said, \u0027Tara, you\u0027re a pretty girl and you\u0027ve been good company, but I owe a debt to Mickey\u0027s master, and Mickey wants you now.\u0027 \"\\n\\n I knew my mouth was hanging open, and I didn\u0027t care. I could scarcely believe what Tara was telling me. I could hear the humiliation rolling off of her in waves of self-loathing. \"You couldn\u0027t do anything about it?\" I asked. I was trying to keep the incredulity out of my voice.\\n\\n \"Believe me, I tried,\" Tara said bitterly. She wasn\u0027t blaming me for my question, which was a relief. \"I told him I wouldn\u0027t. I told him I wasn\u0027t a whore, that I\u0027d been dating him because I liked him.\" Her shoulders collapsed. \"But you know, Sookie, I wasn\u0027t telling the whole truth, and he knew it. I took all the presents he gave me. They were expensive things. But they were freely given, and he didn\u0027t tell me there were strings attached! I never asked for anything!\"\\n\\n \"So he was saying that because you\u0027d accepted his gifts, you were bound to do as he said?\"\\n\\n \"He said - \" Tara began weeping, and her sobs made everything come out in little jerks. \"He said that I was acting like a mistress, and he\u0027d paid for everything I had, and that I might as well be of more use to him. I said I wouldn\u0027t, that I\u0027d give him back everything, and he said he didn\u0027t want it. He told me this vamp named Mickey had seen me out with him, that Franklin owed Mickey a big favor.\"\\n\\n \"But this is America,\" I protested. \"How can they do that?\"\\n\\n \"Vampires are awful,\" Tara said dismally. \"I don\u0027t know how you can stand hanging out with them. I thought I was so cool, having a vamp boyfriend. Okay, he was more like a sugar daddy, I guess.\" Tara sighed at the admission. \"It was just so nice being, you know, treated so well. I\u0027m not used to that. I really thought he liked me, too. I wasn\u0027t just being greedy.\"\\n\\n \"Did he take blood from you?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t they always?\" she asked, surprised. \"During sex?\"\\n\\n \"As far as I know,\" I said. \"Yeah. But you know, after he had your blood, he could tell how you felt about him.\"\\n\\n \"He could?\"\\n\\n \"After they\u0027ve had your blood, they\u0027re tuned in to your feelings.\" I was quite sure that Tara hadn\u0027t been as fond of Franklin Mott as she\u0027d been saying, that she was much more interested in his lavish gifts and courteous treatment than in him. Of course, he\u0027d known that. He might not have much cared if Tara liked him for himself or not, but that had surely made him more inclined to trade her off. \"So how\u0027d it happen?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it wasn\u0027t so abrupt as I\u0027ve made it sound,\" she said. She stared down at her hands. \"First Franklin said he couldn\u0027t go somewhere with me, so would it be okay if this other guy took me instead? I thought he was thinking of me, of how disappointed I\u0027d be if I didn\u0027t get to go - it was a concert - so I really didn\u0027t brood over it. Mickey was on his best behavior, and it wasn\u0027t a bad evening. He left me at the door, like a gentleman.\"\\n\\n I tried not to raise my eyebrows in disbelief. The snakelike Mickey, whose every pore breathed \"bad to the bone,\" had persuaded Tara he was a gentleman? \"Okay, so then what?\"\\n\\n \"Then Franklin had to go out of town, so Mickey came by to see if I had everything I needed, and he brought me a present, which I thought was from Franklin.\"\\n\\n Tara was lying to me, and halfway lying to herself. She had surely known the present, a bracelet, was from Mickey. She had persuaded herself it was kind of a vassal\u0027s tribute to his lord\u0027s lady, but she had known it wasn\u0027t from Franklin.\\n\\n \"So I took it, and we went out, and then when we came back that night, he started making advances. And I broke that off.\" She gave me a calm and regal face.\\n\\n She may have repulsed his advances that night, but she hadn\u0027t done it instantly and decisively.\\n\\n Even Tara forgot I could read her mind.\\n\\n \"So that time he left,\" she said. She took a deep breath. \"The next time, he didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d given plenty of advance warning of his intentions.\\n\\n I looked at her. She flinched. \"I know,\" she wailed. \"I know, I did wrong!\"\\n\\n \"So, is he living at your place?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a day place somewhere close,\" she said, limp with misery. \"He shows up at dark, and we\u0027re together the whole night. He takes me to meetings, he takes me out, and he...\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay.\" I patted her hand. That didn\u0027t seem like enough, and I hugged her closer. Tara was taller than I, so it wasn\u0027t a very maternal hug, but I just wanted my friend to know I was on her side.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s real rough,\" Tara said very quietly. \"He\u0027s going to kill me some day.\"\\n\\n \"Not if we kill him first.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, we can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You think he\u0027s too strong?\"\\n\\n \"I think I can\u0027t kill someone, even him.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I had thought Tara had more grit to her, after what her parents had put her through. \"Then we have to think of a way to pry him off you.\"\\n\\n \"What about your friend?\"\\n\\n \"Which one?\"\\n\\n \"Eric. Everyone says that Eric has a thing for you.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone?\"\\n\\n \"The vampires around here. Did Bill pass you to Eric?\"\\n\\n He\u0027d told me once I should go to Eric if anything happened to him, but I hadn\u0027t taken that as meaning Eric should assume the same role that Bill had in my life. As it turned out, I had had a fling with Eric, but under entirely different circumstances.\\n\\n \"No, he didn\u0027t,\" I said with absolute clarity. \"Let me think.\" I mulled it over, feeling the terrible pressure of Tara\u0027s eyes. \"Who\u0027s Mickey\u0027s boss?\" I asked. \"Or his sire?\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s a woman,\" Tara said. \"At least, Mickey\u0027s taken me to a place in Baton Rouge a couple of times, a casino, where he\u0027s met with a female vamp. Her name is Salome.\"\\n\\n \"Like in the Bible?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Imagine naming your kid that.\"\\n\\n \"So, is this Salome a sheriff?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Is she a regional boss?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Mickey and Franklin never talked about that stuff.\"\\n\\n I tried not to look as exasperated as I felt. \"What\u0027s the name of the casino?\"\\n\\n \"Seven Veils.\"\\n\\n Hmmm. \"Okay, did he treat her with deference?\" That was a good Word of the Day entry from my calendar, which I hadn\u0027t seen since the fire.\\n\\n \"Well, he kind of bowed to her.\"\\n\\n \"Just his head, or from the waist?\"\\n\\n \"From the waist. Well, more than the head. I mean, he bent over.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. What did he call her?\"\\n\\n \"Mistress.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" I hesitated, and then asked again, \"You\u0027re sure we can\u0027t kill him?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you can,\" she said morosely. \"I stood over him with an ice pick for fifteen minutes one night when he went to sleep after, you know, sex. But I was too scared. If he finds out I\u0027ve been here to see you, he\u0027ll get mad. He doesn\u0027t like you at all. He thinks you\u0027re a bad influence.\"\\n\\n \"He got that right,\" I said with a confidence I was far from feeling. \"Let me see what I can think of.\"\\n\\n Tara left after another hug. She even managed a little smile, but I didn\u0027t know how justified her flash of optimism might be.\\n\\n There was only one thing I could do.\\n\\n The next night I\u0027d be working. It was full dark by now, and he\u0027d be up.\\n\\n I had to call Eric. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-as-a-doornail-sookie-stackhouse-5/page-12.html","bookId":2195,"book":{"id":2195,"title":"Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5)","description":"Storyline: Dead as a Doornail (Sookie Stackhouse #5) \\n Small-town cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has had more than her share of experience with the supernatural—but now it’s really hitting close to home.
