Didn\u0027t my father give you his blessing?\"\\n\\n Dr. Badmaev stood up quickly. \"Forgive me, Your Imperial Highness, but I must get back to my patients.\" With a quick bow to the grand duke and an encouraging smile toward me, he withdrew from the room, leaving us alone.\\n\\n I stared into my teacup, refusing to meet George\u0027s eye. \"How on earth did you know to find me here?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"The imperial guard has orders to watch your movements, Katiya. They always know where you are.\"\\n\\n A sick feeling rose in my stomach. \"So you\u0027ve known about my studies with Dr. Badmaev? And the tsar knows as well?\" There truly were no secrets left untouched in St. Petersburg.\\n\\n He nodded as he sat down in the chair next to me. \"I understand what you\u0027re trying to do, but it won\u0027t work. My illness was caused by dueling with the crown prince at Vorontsov Palace. Blood magic wounded me. Medicine cannot help me.\"\\n\\n \"But I believe Eastern medicine can,\" I protested. \"Dr. Badmaev is the one who cured the Koldun after I brought him back from the Graylands. Remember how awful he looked? Eastern medicine treats the spirit as well as the body. Please let the Tibetan doctor examine you.\"\\n\\n \"My parents have expressly forbidden it,\" he said. \"Badmaev is the Dark Court\u0027s physician. Besides, the Light Court has all of St. Petersburg\u0027s finest trained physicians at hand.\"\\n\\n \"None of whom can do a thing for you,\" I said. \"I have learned so much from Dr. Badmaev. Not enough to cure you, I know, but I\u0027m certain that soon I\u0027ll know what to do to make you better. If the tsar will not allow the Tibetan to treat you, then allow me to help you.\"\\n\\n \"Marry me, Katiya. That is the best way for you to make me better.\" He took the teacup out of my hand and set it on the table. Grasping my hands in his, he looked up at me. \"Make me a happy man.\"\\n\\n He would force me to have this conversation right now. \"George, if something were to happen to you and I could have prevented it by continuing my studies, I couldn\u0027t live with myself. I love you too much.\"\\n\\n \"What are you saying?\" There was a flash of silver in his eyes.\\n\\n \"If your father will not change his mind about my becoming a doctor,\" I said, dragging the words out and hating myself for what I said next, \"then I cannot marry you.\"\\n\\n George\u0027s face darkened. \"Katiya, the tsar does not change his mind.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered, trying very hard not to cry in front of him.\\n\\n He stood up so abruptly that I thought he was going to break something. Frustrated, he ran his fingers through his hair. \"Why must you be so hardheaded?\"\\n\\n \"Why must you?\" I asked, praying he wouldn\u0027t notice the trembling in my voice. \"I can\u0027t stand by and watch you waste away. Not when there\u0027s something I can do to stop it.\" I stood up and grabbed his arms, pulling on his sleeves. \"And what if you died? What if I was tempted to bring you back for selfish reasons? I don\u0027t think I could let you go. Or what if I brought you back from the grave accidentally?\" I continued as my imagination ran wild with dark thoughts. \"Don\u0027t you see how horrible that would be? I would damn us both!\"\\n\\n He touched my cheek. \"Katiya, I\u0027d rather be damned with you than live a blessed life without you.\"\\n\\n I held his hand in both of mine and kissed his knuckles. I did not even bother trying to stop the tears anymore. They were falling too fast. \"Georgi, please don\u0027t say that. You know you don\u0027t mean it.\"\\n\\n He looked sad. \"I asked you not to give up on me last year. And I believed that you had not. Why now? When our happiness is within reach? Or was I just dreaming?\" But he did not wait for me to answer. Instead, he leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead, murmuring, \"Goodbye, Katiya,\" against my skin.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t respond. I stood shaking, dazed and in shock, and watched him leave, listened to his boots echo down the wooden hallway as he left Dr. Badmaev\u0027s office. I heard the bells on the door tinkle as he opened it and walked out. Did he truly believe I\u0027d given up on him? On us? Why couldn\u0027t he understand that what I was doing was out of love? Had I lost him for good?\\n\\n Masha returned to pick up the tea things. She hurried across the room as soon as she saw me crying. \"Duchess? Are you all right? Duchess?\"\\n\\n I blinked slowly at her, ignoring the tears rolling down my cheeks. \"Masha, what have I done?\"\\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-8.html","bookId":2655,"book":{"id":2655,"title":"The Morning Star (Katerina #3)","description":"Storyline: The Morning Star (Katerina #3) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890 \\n Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, wants to be known as a doctor, not a necromancer.
