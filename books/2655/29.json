{"id":63802,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"I awoke in a tiny room, not remembering at first where I was. And then it all came back to me. I\u0027d given in to the tears and cried myself to sleep. Now my head ached and my eyes were puffy. The ship rolled gently, and glancing at the window, I could see the lights from the waterfront passing by slowly. The sky was just beginning to lighten. We\u0027d left Cairo. I had no idea where we were.\\n\\n I washed my face in the tiny basin in my cabin and tried to make my hair presentable. I finally gave up and twisted it into a topknot. I was shocked to find my door unlocked.\\n\\n In the early-morning sun, I could see that the steamer we were on was just a small cruiser, with only a few cabins and one large common room on the main deck. In the common room, I found Danilo and Mala. They were arguing over a piece of papyrus in Mala\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t know what they\u0027re looking for,\" Mala was saying. \"I\u0027m sure it will be safe.\"\\n\\n Danilo tore the papyrus out of her hand. \"It won\u0027t matter if the tomb has already been desecrated.\"\\n\\n \"What tomb?\" I asked. \"Where are we headed?\"\\n\\n Mala turned away and went to stare out the window and sulk.\\n\\n Danilo pulled a chair out for me, gesturing for me to sit. \"Abydos.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that south of Cairo?\"\\n\\n \"Quite a distance south, actually.\" Danilo sat in the chair opposite me and stirred his coffee. \"I had a private steamer chartered to get us there as fast as possible. I\u0027m afraid we have no time for sightseeing at Sakkara or Armana. And I\u0027ve had to persuade the captain to travel through the night as well to get us there in record time.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand. What is in Abydos? I thought we were returning to St. Petersburg.\"\\n\\n Mala laughed and turned to face me. \"We must go to the temple in Abydos for Konstantin\u0027s ritual. Once it is completed, Papus will have no choice but to help us.\"\\n\\n \"The ritual you spoke of in the bazaar?\" I had an uneasy feeling about ancient Egyptian rituals, and I hated that Mala knew more about the crown prince\u0027s plans than I did.\\n\\n Danilo smiled. \"I don\u0027t believe it will be anything you have not done before.\"\\n\\n A chill slid down the back of my neck. I did not want to take part in anything Danilo was planning. Konstantin was a powerful necromancer in his own right. \"You have no need of me, Danilo. You know perfectly well you are capable of handling this on your own.\"\\n\\n He leaned forward and tucked a loose strand of my hair behind my ear. His voice was soft but deadly. \"Oh no, Duchess. The necromancer who recites this ritual must be pure. Something, alas, that is too late for me.\"\\n\\n Revulsion washed over me. I felt cold and clammy. And slightly nauseated. I had no desire to think about Danilo\u0027s ... impurity. What if he and Mala had ...? No, I did not want to think about it.\\n\\n \"I still have a part to play,\" he continued. \"This ritual will require every ounce of power the two of us possess. It requires a small sacrifice.\"\\n\\n \"You would never kill me.\" But I did not believe my own words.\\n\\n His smile showed his sharp, tiny fangs. \"I wouldn\u0027t say never, Katerina. But no, not at this time.\" He glanced from me to Mala enigmatically, his eyes flashing from black to green and back to the strange hazel color that told me the two men were fighting for control of Danilo\u0027s body again. I feared it was only a matter of time before Danilo would surrender completely to the lich tsar.\\n\\n Then the crown prince\u0027s mood changed as he sat back and dumped three heaping spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee. With a much more pleasant smile, he said, \"Have you never heard of the Temple of Osiris at Abydos?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Is it near Luxor and the Valley of the Kings?\" A few years ago, I\u0027d read about a Russian explorer who had traveled all the way down the Nile to Luxor. His discoveries had been the talk of all the Dark Court balls that season.\\n\\n \"Close, but on the opposite side of the Nile. Abydos was the site where the pharaoh Seti built his pyramids. He also built a beautiful temple to the god Osiris.\"\\n\\n \"The god who was brought back from the dead by Isis,\" I said, remembering my Egyptian mythology. A Necromancer\u0027s Companion would have come in handy if I\u0027d had it with me.\\n\\n Danilo nodded. \"The temple at Abydos is allegedly where Osiris was brought back to life. And where his greatest treasures were interred. This site is one of the most recently discovered, so it has not been completely excavated. Nor has it been plundered by grave robbers.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that what you intend to do if you find the sword?\" I asked. I wondered if we could be arrested for disturbing a historical site. I wondered if it would be foolish to alert the authorities to Danilo\u0027s plans.\\n\\n \"The Morning Star is not an Egyptian artifact, Katerina. It is not of this world.\"\\n\\n \"Which means it does not belong to you any more than it does to anyone else.\"\\n\\n His hazel eyes narrowed as he glared at me. \"And what would you have us do with it?\"\\n\\n \"Find some way to destroy it,\" I said. \"Or give it back to the Grigori. Such a dangerous weapon should not be placed in anyone\u0027s hands.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible.\" He laughed, but it was a cruel and cold laugh. \"You are so naive.\" He took my hand and smoothed over my skin with his fingertips. \"I wish sometimes that I were as innocent as you, Katerina.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d never felt less innocent than at that moment. His touch made my stomach squirm. I was revolted. I jerked my hand back from him. \"How long will it take us to reach Abydos?\"\\n\\n \"By pressing forward without stops along the way, we should reach Abydos by tomorrow afternoon,\" the crown prince said.\\n\\n One of the Grigori brought us breakfast, a few pieces of flatbread and dates. Danilo did not even allow me a cup of coffee or tea. \"You are fasting in preparation for the ritual. Only light foods and water for now. And after tonight, only water until the ritual is complete.\"\\n\\n The flatbread and dates were delicious, but I feared that I would be weak by the time the ritual occurred. Somehow, I would have to keep my wits about me.\\n\\n Danilo and Mala, I noticed, were eating light meals as well. Mala nibbled on her fruit and Danilo only picked at his bread. I wondered if he was actually nervous about the ritual. As much as I hated and feared the lich tsar, I had come to feel sorry for the crown prince. I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d ever planned on any of this to happen when we conducted his ascension ritual in Cetinje. Being possessed had in fact been one of his greatest fears.\\n\\n I wondered if there was a way of defeating Konstantin without harming Danilo. I had no wish to marry him, but it did not mean I hoped this would all end badly for him. If I had to kill the crown prince in order to kill Konstantin, could I do it?\\n\\n A chill crept over my skin. Danilo glanced over at me and frowned. I put my napkin on the table. My appetite was gone.\\n\\n \"Before we reach Abydos, I must tell you a little about Egyptian magic,\" the crown prince said. \"You\u0027ve used it each time you call upon the shadows to hide you.\"\\n\\n \"The Sheult spell was in A Necromancer\u0027s Companion.\"\\n\\n \"That book was taken from some of the writings of Ankh-al-Sekhem, as well as those of ancient Arabic and Greek necromancers. A French sorcerer compiled the book in the late sixteen hundreds.\"\\n\\n It was strange to think I had the bitter old Egyptian mummy to thank for the Sheult spell. It had protected me many times.\\n\\n \"The Egyptians knew about one\u0027s cold light. They called it the ka,\" Danilo continued. \"Or the body double.\"\\n\\n \"I thought the ka was the soul they built their pyramids for.\" I\u0027d not read much about Egyptology, but I\u0027d overheard a few conversations between tourists and tour guides while we were in the museum in Cairo.\\n\\n \"According to the Ani Papyrus, the soul contains several parts, and the cold light, or the ka, is merely one part. Most of the rituals in the papyrus aid the deceased in restoring all the parts of the soul together so it may rise again.\"\\n\\n I frowned. \"Danilo, everyone did not return from the dead in ancient Egypt. One does not see streets populated with walking corpses.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"That is because they remain in the necropolis. In the cities of the dead. And only royalty was given the rites of resurrection, Katerina. Not everyone could be brought back.\"\\n\\n The slaves and the merchants and the soldiers and the rest of the pharaoh\u0027s people had to be content with their short, hard lives, while the pharaoh cheated death and lived on in his beautiful, gilded pyramid. It did not seem fair. \"When did you have time to read so much?\" I asked. \"Surely you did not glean all of that information from that fragment of the papyrus.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. I read Johanna\u0027s Companion many, many years before it fell into your hands, my dear.\" He nodded to the younger Grigori, who came forth with something wrapped in an old black cloth. The Grigori presented his bundle to me.\\n\\n With a bewildered \"Thank you,\" I took the bundle and unwrapped the black silk. The fabric was fragile, and I was afraid it would crumble in my hands. \"Where did you get this?\" I asked, astounded. It was A Necromancer\u0027s Companion. But it was not my copy. This one was written in French.\\n\\n \"It is a pity you did not bring your own book, Katerina,\" Danilo said lazily. \"Fortunately, the Grigori were able to find a replacement.\"\\n\\n \"You are most gracious,\" I said to the Grigori, whose face betrayed no emotion. I carefully wrapped the silk around the book again and placed the seemingly innocent bundle in my lap. It had been responsible for the fate of possibly thousands of Egyptians. \"Has it ever occurred to you how much our tsar is like the ancient pharaohs?\"\\n\\n \"They rule by divine right,\" Danilo said with a shrug. \"It is the will of the gods.\"\\n\\n \"But the people had no voice,\" I said. \"They lived and died at the whim of the pharaoh.\"\\n\\n \"Who is the voice of God.\" Danilo\u0027s eyes narrowed.\\n\\n Mala\u0027s voice broke in on our conversation. \"Your education has been filling your head with revolutionary ideas, hasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not! But it does pain me to see people who believe the tsar does not care about them.\"\\n\\n \"Why should he care about them?\" Danilo said, leaning forward. \"They pay their taxes and fight in the tsar\u0027s armies, and in return, the tsar protects them from foreign attacks.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that\u0027s all a tsar is responsible for?\" I asked. \"Tsar Pavel never prepared you for ruling Russia. Your father never wanted you to be tsar.\" I knew I was risking Konstantin\u0027s anger again. But I had to get Danilo to see how dangerous the lich tsar was. He would not be a good tsar. He would not listen to the people.\\n\\n Danilo\u0027s hands pounded the table in anger. \"It was not his choice! Grandmother wanted me to rule Byzantium! Nicholas tried to recapture Constantinople and failed. But now that my brother is dead, I will rule both Byzantium and all of the Russias! The two kingdoms will be united under my power.\"\\n\\n Mala stood up from the table and went to kneel at Danilo\u0027s side. \"You will make a wise and powerful tsar, Your Imperial Majesty,\" she told him. Her faerie eyes shimmered and it seemed to calm him.\\n\\n The Grigori standing nearby said nothing. The two men revealed no emotion, nor did they seem fazed by the lich tsar\u0027s anger. They believed he would carry the Morning Star. And they would follow whoever carried the sword.\\n\\n \"The Ottomans are too powerful for Russia to wage war against right now,\" I said. \"Even Empress Katerina realized this before she died. Capturing Byzantium was nothing but an old woman\u0027s dream.\"\\n\\n Danilo glared at me. \"You do not deserve to carry her name, Duchess.\" He stood, pushing Mala to the side as he reached out and grabbed my arm. \"It is time for you to retire to your cabin and meditate for the coming ritual.\"\\n\\n His fingers dug into my arm and he dragged me out of the dining room back out to the cramped deck. With a rough shove, he pushed me into my cabin. \"You will be allowed out when we arrive at Abydos,\" he said, locking the door behind me.\\n\\n I stumbled toward my bed. I had no idea how to prepare myself for the ritual, other than worrying about it and working myself up into hysterics. That was not something I cared to do, so instead, I opened up the French edition of A Necromancer\u0027s Companion the Grigori had given me and searched for information on the ka. Was it really one\u0027s cold light? That would explain why a necromancer could manipulate that light, and shadows as well.\\n\\n I flipped past the pages of incantations to Osiris that prevented the deceased from forgetting his name and past an incantation that allowed the deceased to take any physical form he wished, from a lion to a hawk. I flipped past the drawings of ornate inscriptions on ceremonial daggers and pictures of enchanted scarabs that were to be placed on the deceased\u0027s breast.\\n\\n And finally, I came to a chapter that mentioned the Morning Star. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-29.html","bookId":2655,"book":{"id":2655,"title":"The Morning Star (Katerina #3)","description":"Storyline: The Morning Star (Katerina #3) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890 \\n Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, wants to be known as a doctor, not a necromancer.
