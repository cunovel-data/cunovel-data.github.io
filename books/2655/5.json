{"id":63778,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The next day I was seated at a small table in a large room at Anichkov Palace, eating a delightful ni\u0026ccedil;oise salad at a charity luncheon with Princess Alix of Hesse and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna. Princess Alix was growling. It was unnerving to those of us who could hear her. Fortunately, only the grand duchess and I were close enough.\\n\\n \"Who does she think she is?\" Alix asked, stabbing her lettuce with a sterling silver repousse fork that was probably older than the palace itself. The Sevres china service had been a present to my great-great-great-grandmother, Katerina the Great, from Marie Antoinette. \"She is nothing but a skinny dancer. And a witch.\"\\n\\n Xenia patted her hand in sympathy. \"She has dazzled him with her glamour. It\u0027s nothing more.\"\\n\\n Alix was upset because upon attending the ballet The Pharaoh\u0027s Daughter with her sister, she had seen the tsarevitch talking with one of the dancers behind stage. Mathilde Kschessinskaya was a beautiful dark faerie who was bewitching all of St. Petersburg with her seductive dancing. Alix had been dismayed to see the way her Nicholas had been completely enchanted. The tsarevitch had not even seemed to notice Alix when she stepped out of her sister\u0027s theater box at the Mariinsky Theater. \"The heathen,\" Alix growled again.\\n\\n I glanced around nervously, hoping none of the empress\u0027s other guests took notice. Most people believed the Hessian princess to be soft-spoken and modest, but I knew she could be quite feral if she believed there was evil or injustice for her to battle. Even though she knew all of my dark secrets and had seen one of my undead creatures, she still counted me as a friend. She had decided that my soul was good. I was terrified of ever disappointing her.\\n\\n Xenia shook her head, her dark ringlets swinging as she dug into her pheasant croquette. \"Do not fear, Alix. Nicky does not feel anything for Mathilde. She is a pretty diversion, nothing more.\"\\n\\n \"And would you feel the same way if your Sandro was the one making eyes at her?\" Alix asked.\\n\\n Xenia frowned at both of us. \"What can you do? She is protected by the Dark Court, is she not?\"\\n\\n \"Do you truly think Miechen approves of her?\" I asked. \"Her husband has been seen smiling at her a little too fondly as well.\"\\n\\n Xenia giggled. \"If Uncle Vladimir acts too friendly with the girl, Aunt Miechen will see that poor Mathilde is sent to a ballet troupe in Siberia.\"\\n\\n Alix looked thoughtful. \"Could the grand duchess actually do that?\" she asked. \"Or the empress?\"\\n\\n \"Mother would not deign to interfere,\" Xenia said. \"The ballerina is a creature of the Dark Court. She is Aunt Miechen\u0027s responsibility.\"\\n\\n As I ate my pheasant, which was unfortunately cold and dry, I was secretly glad it was not George who had caught the wicked ballerina\u0027s attention. But what would I do if I had a rival for his affections? Especially if it was someone the empress approved of? Would I have the grace and courage to stand aside and wish him every happiness he deserved? The pheasant stuck in my throat.\\n\\n \"Are you all right, Katiya?\" Xenia asked as I tried to choke quietly behind my napkin. She waved to the liveried servant behind us. \"She needs more wine.\"\\n\\n \"Merci,\" I said, noticing unhappily that the empress was now looking at our table. She did not look pleased to see her daughter sitting with a necromancer and the wolf princess of Hesse. The servant had refilled my glass and stepped back without making a sound. I took a sip of the wine and tried to push thoughts of George Alexandrovich out of my mind.\\n\\n \"Have they presented the awards yet?\" Alix asked. \"I don\u0027t think they are going to serve dessert before the awards are given out.\" The luncheon was to honor several aristocratic women who\u0027d given the most time and money to charity during the previous year. My mother had received one of the awards the previous year and had promptly donated it to the Oldenburg Children\u0027s Hospital.\\n\\n Xenia glanced up toward the imperial table, where her mother presided. \"Not yet, I don\u0027t think. Perhaps we could sneak downstairs to the kitchens?\"\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you expected to hand out an award?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Zut alors,\" Xenia said, pouting. \"There\u0027s no sense in you two sitting here and suffering through the speeches as well. What if one of you pretends to be ill? Alix, you should probably take Katerina out for some air.\" Her faerie eyes twinkled with silver. She suddenly leaned forward with a concerned face and put a hand on my shoulder. \"Oh my, you look terrible!\"\\n\\n I hated to make a scene, but Xenia knew Alix and I were not enjoying the pheasant. Perhaps we would find better food in the kitchens. Alix was already trying to help me stand up. She was eager to escape the empress\u0027s gaze as much as I was.\\n\\n \"Can you walk, Katerina Alexandrovna?\" she asked with a grave face.\\n\\n The shocked looks around us led me to worry that Xenia had cast a glamour over my appearance. I was too terrified to glance at the empress\u0027s table. If she saw me, she would certainly see through whatever Xenia had done. \"We\u0027ll speak later,\" I told Xenia, and grabbed Alix\u0027s arm.\\n\\n As we left the enormous white dining hall, we passed an ornate mirror that rose up from the floor to the ceiling. I did look a ghastly shade of pale. No wonder no one had tried to stop us from leaving.\\n\\n We reached the grand hallway and paused. Alix looked at me again and shook her head. \"You truly look awful. Perhaps you should find some water.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m perfectly fine,\" I said, waving her concern away. \"It\u0027s just Xenia\u0027s glamour. Do you wish to find the kitchens?\"\\n\\n \"I just wanted to leave the banquet,\" Alix said, sitting down on a plush velvet-upholstered bench. \"I should have a few minutes free before Ella realizes I\u0027m missing.\"\\n\\n \"Maman won\u0027t notice that I\u0027m gone,\" I said, sitting next to her. \"She\u0027s next to your sister.\" It continued to amaze me how Maman belonged to the Dark Court but walked that delicate balance to stay friendly with the empress\u0027s court as well. They were family, after all. My mother was a first cousin of the tsar.\\n\\n We heard someone coming up the grand staircase. Heavy boots clicked smartly against the marble stairs. Hushed male voices carried up ahead of them. Alix glanced at me worriedly. \"Your glamour is gone,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"What does Papa say?\" a familiar but tired voice asked.\\n\\n \"He wants to speak with you this evening, before he and Mother leave for Denmark.\"\\n\\n The tsarevitch had reached the top of the staircase with his brother George Alexandrovich. My heart did a little dance. How long had it been since I\u0027d seen my grand duke? Almost a month. The tsarevitch looked surprised to see Alix. And not all together pleased. \"Your Highness?\" he asked.\\n\\n Alix stood immediately and curtsied. \"Your Imperial Highness.\"\\n\\n George smiled when he saw us. But he looked awful. His skin was pale and he had large shadows under his eyes. I stood and curtsied as well.\\n\\n Nicholas Alexandrovich offered his arm to Alix. \"It has been ages since I\u0027ve seen you. Would you like to step into the red parlor with me and have tea?\" His charming smile worked, and Alix was led away before she could refuse.\\n\\n George offered his arm to me. \"We could join them in the parlor. Or,\" he whispered as I linked my arm in his and his left hand covered mine with a tender squeeze, \"we could have tea in the library?\"\\n\\n His touch sent a warm, happy tingle up and down my arm. \"I believe Princess Alix has something she wants to discuss with the tsarevitch,\" I said. \"Perhaps we should give them some privacy?\"\\n\\n \"Excellent idea,\" he murmured. The library was not a far walk, and he did not bother to ring for tea. The moment the door closed behind us, George\u0027s hands were around my waist, his lips on mine.\\n\\n \"How was Paris?\" I asked when he paused for breath.\\n\\n \"Hot.\" His kisses traveled up my neck.\\n\\n \"I missed you,\" I said, my own kisses clumsily reaching his earlobe, his cheek.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ve missed you.\" His voice was husky. The familiar rush of my cold light spiraling around both of us gave me a dangerous thrill. I felt his magic rising to meet mine and relaxed just slightly. He was truly a stronger mage now, and yet I still worried I could overpower him with my cold light. Or my love.\\n\\n He groaned. \"Katiya,\" he said, slightly winded. He pulled away from me, searching my face. \"Your year is almost up, Duchess.\"\\n\\n \"My year?\" My thoughts came crashing back down to earth. Why couldn\u0027t he just let us enjoy the present moment?\\n\\n \"Remember our promise?\" Last August when I tried to refuse his proposal, he\u0027d asked me for a year to receive his parents\u0027 blessing. But a year ago, he was just beginning his Koldun studies. And I\u0027d believed I was going to medical school.\\n\\n \"But nothing has changed your mother\u0027s mind,\" I said. If anything, I thought she disliked me even more. \"Georgi, you\u0027re as pale as a ghost. Sit down.\" I pulled him over to one of the library chairs. Gently pushing his hair off his face, I asked, \"What have you been doing to yourself?\"\\n\\n He was not going to be distracted with me fussing over his health. He took both of my hands in his. \"I\u0027ve spoken with my father. I\u0027ve told him my plans.\"\\n\\n My heart stopped in my throat. \"And?\"\\n\\n He pulled me closer and his hands settled on my waist once again. I was very aware of the fact that I was standing between his legs as he looked up at me. \"He would like to speak with you.\" George smiled up at me. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. He does not bite.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t smile back. Something in my stomach tightened nervously. What was the name of that muscle again? \"When?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I will send a carriage for you tonight. My parents leave for their villa in Fredensborg in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"And you?\"\\n\\n \"I must stay in St. Petersburg for the present. I have business with the Inner Circle. And the Koldun.\"\\n\\n \"Can you tell me-\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said, stopping my question with another kiss. His hands cupped my face. \"There is nothing for you to worry about.\"\\n\\n I pulled back from him. \"But you are worried about something. You aren\u0027t healing as fast as you should.\" The supernatural wound he\u0027d received dueling with Danilo must not have responded to any of the Koldun\u0027s spells. And the Koldun was recovering from his own brush with death. \"I wish you would let Dr. Badmaev examine you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had my fill of doctors and wizards. I am well enough, Katiya.\" His hands slid up and down my arms slowly. \"Leave it at that.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not getting enough sleep,\" I said, kissing each of his eyelids. His blue eyes looked sunken and hollow. The silver sparkle was not there. He was still my beautiful boy, just more fragile. I would have to discover a cure for him on my own.\\n\\n He pulled me down onto his lap sideways. \"No meddling, Katiya.\" His lips were soft and warm against my ear. It tickled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re in my head again,\" I said, putting a hand on his chest. George\u0027s fae abilities allowed him to hear my thoughts, but not I his. I could feel his heart pounding. Mon Dieu, his skin was hot.\\n\\n \"Your thoughts are too loud to ignore.\"\\n\\n \"What am I thinking now?\" My hand crept up to his collar and my fingertips brushed against the smooth warm skin of his neck peeking out from his shirt. His lips touched my hairline. It sent nice shivers all over my scalp. \"You are thinking that it is a very good thing I\u0027m not going to Denmark with my family.\"\\n\\n I smiled. \"Yes, it could be a very good thing if I get to see you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll find a way, Katiya. I promise.\" He kissed me once more. \"But I think you should probably get back to the luncheon.\"\\n\\n I sighed heavily as I slid off his lap and tried to smooth my skirts. He laughed and stood up, reaching over to tuck one of my wayward curls behind my ear.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m certain no one has missed you,\" he said, grinning. \"Except probably Xenia.\"\\n\\n I put my hand on the doorknob and stopped. \"Should I go and find Alix?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"You left because you were feeling ill, did you not? Now you\u0027re feeling better. You have a much healthier glow.\" His smile was mischievous.\\n\\n I rolled my eyes and turned to go, but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back for one last kiss. \"I\u0027ll see you tonight, Katiya. And we will speak with my father.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure if I should be frightened or excited at the prospect. I felt a little of both. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-5.html","bookId":2655,"book":{"id":2655,"title":"The Morning Star (Katerina #3)","description":"Storyline: The Morning Star (Katerina #3) \\n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890 \\n Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, wants to be known as a doctor, not a necromancer.
