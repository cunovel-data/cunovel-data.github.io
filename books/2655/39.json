It was similar to the one I\u0027d used when Grand Duke Vladimir had been in the Graylands, but this time there was no enchanted throne. Instead, George showed me how to use the large mirror hanging at the end of the hallway-the same one Militza and I had used. Only Militza and I had both been alive when we\u0027d traveled through the mirror.\n George\u0027s cold light had been almost completely severed from his body by Konstantin\u0027s spell. But he\u0027d managed a spell that had kept him hidden, even if barely alive, while he healed. He was still too weak, however, to call upon the Grigori to make a portal of his own.\n \"I can tell you the words to say, but I have no control over the cold light,\" George said. \"A necromancer can touch this light and manipulate it to overcome death. That is why you are able to walk between the two worlds so easily.\"\n I waved my hand in front of the mirror, scattering the mist, and focused on the place we needed to go: Gatchina. His parents would still be there.\n The trip back to the land of the living did not hurt quite so much this time. Maybe it was because I was too giddy to pay attention. I was worried about George, though, and focused my cold light energy on making sure he did not drag behind. The ritual took its toll on him anyway. Pale and coughing, George emerged with me in the cold snowy gardens outside the palace. I grabbed him by the arms to support him. He felt warm and solid, but I still couldn\u0027t believe he was back home with me.\n \"You\u0027re shaking!\" I realized. \"Let\u0027s get you inside.\"\n The members of the Order of St. John who stood guard at the front of the palace could not believe their eyes when I shouted for them to open the gates quickly.\n \"Do as she says,\" George muttered.\n I was not sure if they did not want to follow my orders or were just in shock at seeing him.\n The doors opened, and one of the footmen sent for the tsar immediately. I helped them carry George inside and up to the bedroom he shared with Nicholas. The empress and the tsar arrived soon after, followed by Nicholas and Xenia.\n \"Georgi!\" The empress rushed to his bedside and grabbed his hand. \"Oh, my son!\" she sobbed. \"My prayers have been answered!\"\n The tsar took my hand. \"I owe you everything, Katerina.\" He pulled me into his enormous arms and kissed me on the forehead. \"I would be honored to call you daughter.\"\n \"That\u0027s a very good thing,\" George said happily from the bed. He was already starting to get his color back. \"Because we were married in Egypt.\"\n \"What is this?\" The empress turned around sharply to look at me. I heard Xenia giggle from the doorway. Little Mikhail and Olga were peeking around from behind her skirts.\n The tsar released me from his fatherly embrace, as if to distance himself from me. He did not wish to incur the empress\u0027s wrath, it seemed.\n George tried to push himself up onto his elbow. \"Maman, you know I\u0027ve wanted to marry Katiya for a long time. I did not want to risk losing her again.\"\n Everyone was staring at me. \"It was an Orthodox ceremony,\" I said, as if that would make everything better.\n The empress glared at me, her eyes flashing silvery white. I suddenly worried that I was about to feel the full force of her Light Court powers.\n I turned back to the tsar, finally willing to say what he wanted to hear. \"And I have decided not to attend medical school. There are other things more important to me right now.\"\n The tsar beamed at me as the empress said, \"Well, I should certainly hope so! When I think of those poor girls slaving away over textbooks in the European universities, I feel so sorry for them. And for the families who must miss them.\"\n But I still had hopes that the tsar would change his mind one day and the universities of Russia would be open to all women who sought an education.\n \"No, Katiya,\" George said, struggling to sit up. \"You are not giving up on your dream. We will move wherever we have to so you can become a doctor.\"\n I did not want to agitate the empress any further. I did not want her keeping me away from George while he recuperated. We could decide where we were going to live much later.\n Nicholas and Xenia came into the room to offer their congratulations and hug their brother. Nicholas winked at me, certain I would never betray his part in our wedding. I smiled back at him.\n \"Katiya, your family will probably like to know you are safe,\" the tsar said. It brought tears to my eyes when I realized he\u0027d called me by my nickname. He had already accepted me. \"Shall we send for them?\"\n \"Of course, Your Imperial Majesty. I would be most happy to see my parents.\" I was glad they would be coming to Gatchina, for I feared if I were to leave, the empress might tell the palace guards not to let me back inside.\n \"Katerina, we must find you and George a suite of rooms while he is healing,\" the empress said. She was trying to maintain control over her son\u0027s life for as long as possible. \"When he is healthier, we can discuss purchasing a suitable palace for the two of you.\"\n George grinned. \"Thank you, Maman. I am certain Katiya does not wish to spend the night here with me and Nicky.\"\n Xenia and Nicholas laughed, but they knew the empress was not amused. She stood up and planted a kiss on George\u0027s forehead. Gathering her skirts, she looked at me, her faerie eyes still flashing silver with anger. \"Come along, Katerina.\"\n I moved first to George\u0027s bed to kiss him as well. I felt shy suddenly in front of all of his family, but I did not want to leave him for a moment. He smiled at me tiredly. \"You need your rest as well, Katiya. I\u0027ll see you later.\"\n The empress chose an elegant suite for George and me, far from the children\u0027s rooms, furnished tastefully in the English style that she preferred. The rooms were cozy and full of trinkets and knickknacks she\u0027d accumulated on her travels. \"When I get a chance, we shall sit down and go through my jewelry to see if we can find a suitable wedding gift for you.\"\n \"I\u0027d be honored, Your Imperial Majesty.\"\n She sighed. \"Thank you, Katerina, for saving my son\u0027s life. And thank you for saving us all from that odious vampire couple. Your marriage will take some getting used to, but\"-she picked up my hand and patted it somewhat awkwardly-\"I think you and Georgi will suit each other very well.\"\n I finally let go of the breath I didn\u0027t realize I\u0027d been holding. She wasn\u0027t banishing me. \"Thank you, Your Imperial Majesty.\"\n \"Please, call me Mother Dear. It\u0027s what the children call me.\"\n \"Thank you, Mother Dear,\" I said. The term of affection felt strange on my tongue, but I was relieved that I was not going to be an enemy after all. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-39.html","bookId":2655,"book":{"id":2655,"title":"The Morning Star (Katerina #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Morning Star (Katerina #3) \n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890 \n Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, wants to be known as a doctor, not a necromancer.
