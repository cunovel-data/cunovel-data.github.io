But before I could commit such blasphemy, the crown prince was pulling me toward another jewelry collection.\n I wondered how the Cantacuzene family had gotten a hold of the Talisman of Isis. I suspected it was an artifact that should have been under a glass case in a museum as well. I examined the beautiful ruby bracelets and sapphire earrings and lapis necklaces in the case. Dariya would have been beside herself to see these jewels. She would have enjoyed vacationing in such an exotic place as this.\n But I was not here on vacation. I\u0027d been abducted by an insane lich tsar who believed I was going to be his tsarina. And I had to keep him from finding the sword that could destroy the whole world.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3/page-26.html","bookId":2655,"book":{"id":2655,"title":"The Morning Star (Katerina #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Morning Star (Katerina #3) \n St. Petersburg, Russia, 1890 \n Katerina Alexandrovna, Duchess of Oldenburg, wants to be known as a doctor, not a necromancer. But Tsar Alexander III forbids women to attend medical school; his interest in Katerina extends only to her ability to raise the dead. Twice now, Katerina has helped him by using her power to thwart the forces of darkness—vampires bent on resurrecting the lich tsar Konstantin Pavlovich so that he can take what he sees as his rightful place on the throne. Katerina thought she had bound Konstantin to the Greylands, the realm of the dead, but he has found a way out. Now he is searching for the Morning Star, a sword that will allow him to command a legion of supernatural warriors. \n Katerina must find the sword before Konstantin does—and she must travel to Egypt to do so. Along the way, she puts up with unwanted attention from her former fiancé, the nefarious Prince Danilo, and struggles with her feelings for her true love, George Alexandrovich. But with the looming threat from Konstantin, Katerina\u0027s focus remains on the sword. Russia\u0027s fate will be determined by whoever wields the Morning Star—and delivers the final blow.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-morning-star-katerina-3.jpg","author":"Robin Bridges","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-morning-star-katerina-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:00 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:51:43 AM"}}
