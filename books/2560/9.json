{"id":112153,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"As I had planned earlier, I arrived at my parents\u0027 house washed, refreshed and feeling a little more relaxed than I had done earlier in the day. I parked the car and walked towards the little house which had been my home for many years. There were thousands of memories locked up in the tiny building and, as I approached, I prayed that the people close to me who still lived within its walls were safe and well. All the talk of energy waves and all of the confusion that I had witnessed over the last couple of days made me long to return to the security of the past and of my childhood. As I stood on the doorstep and opened the front door, a wave of tender sentimentality washed over me. One of the most unusual and unexpected aspects of the heat and of the recent bizarre conditions was the distorting effect that they had on my body clock. Although it felt like summer, it was dark by five o\u0027clock and it stayed that way until late in the morning. It was difficult sometimes to convince myself that it really was late October and, although the darkness made it feel as if it should be much later, by the time I went into the house it had only just turned seven-thirty. Inside the building was dark and the living-room was illuminated only by the flickering blue light of the television set in the corner of the room and by a dull, yellow glow from the open kitchen doorway. When she heard the front door open. Mom came into the living-room and she smiled when she saw me. \u0027Hello, love. How are you?\u0027 she asked in her soothing, peaceful voice. \u0027I\u0027m fine, Mom,\u0027 I replied as I walked across the room and followed her into the kitchen. \u0027Tired, but fine.\u0027 Finally hearing Mom speak again helped me to calm down and to forget the troubles of the day. She had a relaxing, gentle quality to her voice which immediately took me back to my childhood days. When we were younger, Mom\u0027s incredible ability to remain restrained and rational had usually resulted in both my sister and myself ignoring her when she had needed to reprimand us (authority was always maintained by my father who, in such instances, always told us off with a well-aimed slap with the back of his hand). Today, however, Mom\u0027s tone lifted me and managed to restore a little piece of normality to the increasingly crazy and hectic world that I found myself living in. \u0027Where\u0027s Dad?\u0027 I asked as Mom filled the kettle from the tap. \u0027He\u0027s outside,\u0027 she replied, nodding her head through the window and towards a barely discernible shape sitting out on the back lawn. \u0027Poor thing,\u0027 she continued. \u0027This heat\u0027s really knocked him for six.\u0027 I walked quietly towards the back door and peered through the glass to look at my dad who sat bathed in the low yellow light which spilled out across the lawn from the kitchen window. When I had been living at home, my parents had never seemed to age. In my mind, they had looked the same on the day I left home as they had done in my earliest memories. It was only now that I was not seeing them on a daily basis that they seemed to be getting any older and today, sadly, Dad looked desperately frail, tired and ancient. As I watched my father sleeping in an old deckchair, a light wind blew across the garden and he shuffled uncomfortably. The breeze ruffled the delicate strands of white hair which lay across his head and the light from the house combined with the sparse silver rays of the moon to cast ghastly haggard shadows across his face. Dad\u0027s glasses were perched precariously on the end of his wrinkled nose and the only movement he made was as his chin slowly shifted up and down as it rested on his heaving chest. \u0027He doesn\u0027t look too bad,\u0027 I said to Mom. I was quite worried by Dad\u0027s appearance but I did my best to try and allay any of the fears that my mother might have had. \u0027He might look all right,\u0027 she said, \u0027but he\u0027s not himself. You know your father, he\u0027s not one to make a fuss when he\u0027s under the weather but I can tell. I\u0027ve been with him for long enough.\u0027 I looked into Mom\u0027s face as she toiled over the hot pots and pans on top of the kitchen stove. She looked tired and worn out and I could see the strain and worry that Dad\u0027s condition was obviously causing her to feel. Although there was the best part of a ten-year age gap between my parents and she didn\u0027t look anywhere near as aged as Dad did, Mom still seemed to be growing old at an alarming rate. \u0027Steven,\u0027 Mom said (she was the only person who called me that and not Steve). \u0027We\u0027re going to go up and visit your Uncle George for a little while.\u0027 I was relieved to hear that. Uncle George lived on the Scottish coast and, when I was younger, whenever we had visited there as a family, Dad had spent most of our time there complaining that the North was far too cold for him. \u0027That\u0027s good news,\u0027 I told Mom. \u0027That should really do Dad a lot of good. It\u0027s about time you had a rest as well.\u0027 Mom nodded and smiled. She seemed pleased that I approved of their plans. \u0027What about Michelle?\u0027 I asked, wondering what my younger sister was going to do. \u0027She\u0027s coming with us. The poor love\u0027s been having a rough time at college recently. I think it\u0027ll do her as much good to get away for a while as it will your father.\u0027 \u0027When are you thinking of going?\u0027 \u0027Tomorrow. We\u0027re going up by train. We leave at half past nine.\u0027 The immediacy of their leaving shocked me. Dad was notoriously slow at making plans and decisions and Mom could see that I was genuinely surprised. \u0027It\u0027ll be for the best,\u0027 she said, reassuringly. \u0027We\u0027ll stay up there for a while and come home when things get back to normal.\u0027 Michelle came bounding down the stairs and burst energetically into the kitchen. \u0027I thought I could smell something!\u0027 she joked, cheekily. \u0027Stevie\u0027s here!\u0027 I laughed sarcastically and walked over to greet her. We hugged for a moment and, once more, I realised just how much my conceptions of my family had changed since I had moved out. Before I had left, there had been days when Michelle and I could hardly bear to be in the same room as each other and yet we now hugged one another as if we had been apart for years. \u0027How\u0027s things?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Not too bad,\u0027 I replied, giving little away. \u0027What about you? Are you all right?\u0027 Strangely subdued, she nodded her head slowly and sat down at the table. \u0027Can you go and get your father for me?\u0027 Mom asked, looking in my direction. \u0027I\u0027m about to serve up dinner.\u0027 I went outside to fetch Dad and was surprised by the brittle crunching of the moisture-starved grass beneath my feet. I stood at Dad\u0027s side and gently shook his shoulder. He began to come around. \u0027Hello, son,\u0027 he said in a voice that sounded tired, feeble and weak. \u0027How are you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m all right. Dad,\u0027 I replied. \u0027I\u0027ve had enough of this heat though. It\u0027s a bit hot, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Too bloody hot,\u0027 he snapped bluntly as he pushed his aching frame up and out of the chair. I held his arm to help him but he brushed my hand away. \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 he grumbled. \u0027Just a bit stiff, that\u0027s all.\u0027 Dad moved away from the support of the deckchair, turned and shuffled towards the open back door. I watched him sadly as he moved. Dad had always been such a fit and active man that to see him like this was heartbreaking. I knew that Mom was right and, although she hadn\u0027t said as much, I could see that the incredible conditions were killing him. We sat around the kitchen table to eat our meal and, for a while, things were just like they had been before I had left home. Mom sat opposite Dad and I had the pleasure of sitting directly across the table from my little sister. Although Mom had struggled in the kitchen for a long time to prepare our meal, none of us seemed able to eat much. I toyed with the food on my plate while I thought of Samantha and I chewed a couple of hot, filling mouthfuls. I looked up to see that Michelle was staring at me and I was sure that she wanted to ask something. Her intuition seemed to have told her that I had begun seeing someone and then, with her usual disregard for tact and decorum, she began to pursue the issue with unavoidable and embarrassing questions. \u0027So, Steve,\u0027 she began, \u0027am I imagining things or are you happier than usual tonight? Have you finally managed to find yourself a decent girlfriend?\u0027 I almost choked on the mouthful of food that I was eating. \u0027What makes you think that?\u0027 I asked, keen not to give anything away without a struggle. \u0027I know you too well,\u0027 she replied. \u0027You\u0027re being nice to me and that\u0027s a sure sign that something\u0027s up.\u0027 Michelle smiled sweetly, desperate for information and gossip. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m going out with anyone, does it?\u0027 I said with deliberate ambiguity. \u0027Does anybody want another drink?\u0027 I asked, trying unsuccessfully to change the subject. My love life was not something that I wanted to discuss in front of Mom and Dad. \u0027I bet you are,\u0027 she said, putting down her knife and fork. \u0027Well, as a matter of fact, I am,\u0027 I said, shoving more food into my mouth. That was all that I wanted to say but Michelle, typically, had other ideas. \u0027I knew, I could tell!\u0027 she shouted. \u0027What\u0027s her name? Where did you meet her? Come on, I want to know everything.\u0027 \u0027Her name\u0027s Samantha, and that\u0027s all you\u0027re going to get,\u0027 I said with my mouth still half full of food. \u0027Leave your brother alone,\u0027 Mom interrupted. \u0027He\u0027s come over here for his tea, not to be questioned by you.\u0027 She turned to face me. \u0027I\u0027m sure she\u0027s a lovely girl and you\u0027ll tell us all about her when you\u0027re ready to.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s too bloody hot in here,\u0027 Dad suddenly shouted angrily. The rest of the family around the table became silent as he threw down his knife and fork and stood up. After waiting for a couple of seconds to get his balance, Dad shuffled away from the table and disappeared into the dark living-room. Mom watched him go and I saw that her eyes had filled with tears. Michelle became quiet, fearing guiltily that she had angered our father with her excited behaviour. I pushed my plate away from me, unable to eat any more and watched as Mom stood silently and went into another room. Later that night, I sat in the living-room with Dad. The windows were all fully open and a gentle breeze fluttered into the room which gently lifted the lace nets and light curtains which hung around them. The only light came from a dull table lamp at Dad\u0027s side and the only sound from Mom and Michelle talking in the kitchen. \u0027How are you feeling now, Dad?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Oh, not too bad, son,\u0027 he replied, calmly. \u0027I\u0027ll be glad when this heat finally eases off though.\u0027 \u0027Mom was telling me that you don\u0027t like it. It\u0027ll be better when you get up to Uncle George\u0027s though, won\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027It won\u0027t be the heat getting to me then, it\u0027ll be that bloody wife of his,\u0027 he snapped. \u0027Still, your mother seems to think that it\u0027ll do us all good to get away for a while.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s right you know They say it\u0027s going to get worse before it gets any better.\u0027 \u0027And you\u0027d know, would you?\u0027 Dad snapped, uncharacteristically. He grumbled and took a large swig from a tumbler of whisky which he held in his tired hand. \u0027It\u0027d all be a lot simpler if they hadn\u0027t been buggering around with the planet in the first place.\u0027 \u0027But, Dad,\u0027 I protested foolishly, trying to explain what was actually happening, \u0027it\u0027s the sun that\u0027s causing all of this. It\u0027s got nothing to do with pollution, the ozone layer or anything else.\u0027 Dad hauled himself upright in his seat and leant towards me until his face was only inches from mine. \u0027Son, you can tell me that it\u0027s the sun doing this. You can even tell me that it\u0027s men from Mars. The truth is that none of it would be happening if it wasn\u0027t for those bloody idiots who are supposed to be in charge of this planet.\u0027 There was no point in arguing with Dad. I was sure that it was the heat and stress which were causing him to become irrational and I couldn\u0027t see that there was anything to be gained from prolonging the conversation any further. As I watched him, he picked up the remote control unit that operated the television, switched on the set and flicked through the channels. When he could find nothing that interested him (I didn\u0027t even get asked if I wanted to watch anything) he pushed down the red button in the corner of the controller which made the set die again, plunging the room back into a gloomy semi-darkness. I got up and went to talk to Mom and Michelle in the kitchen. \u0027It\u0027s getting late,\u0027 I said, looking up at the clock on the wall. \u0027I\u0027ll have to be going soon.\u0027 Mom sat at the table and looked up at me sadly. \u0027Can\u0027t you stay for a little longer?\u0027 she asked hopefully. \u0027We might not see you again for a while.\u0027 \u0027Of course you will.\u0027 I said without thinking. \u0027I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t get a couple of days off work and I\u0027ll come up to Uncle George\u0027s and see you all.\u0027 I held out little hope of managing to get time off, but the idea did at least seem to cheer Mom up for a moment. \u0027I hope you can, love. That\u0027d be wonderful,\u0027 she said with a sad, distant look in her eyes. I put my hand on top of hers and smiled. \u0027Everything\u0027s going to be all right. Mom,\u0027 I said. \u0027You just take Dad up to the seaside and he\u0027ll be fine. I promise you, in a week we\u0027ll all be back to normal and you\u0027ll be wishing that the sun had never gone in.\u0027 Mom nodded her head, got up and went into the living-room to check on Dad. I was left alone with Michelle. \u0027Look after them both, won\u0027t you?\u0027 I said. I expected my sister to retort with some half-baked and ill-considered witticism but she surprised me with her seriousness. \u0027I will,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027And you make sure that you\u0027re all right.\u0027 \u0027You know I will. Always looking after number one, that\u0027s me.\u0027 \u0027Good, keep it that way.\u0027 I looked into Michelle\u0027s eyes and saw the same doubt and fear which had been so painfully evident in Mom\u0027s expression. Although I tried to disguise my own fears and worries, I could not help but wonder when I would see my family again. I didn\u0027t want Michelle to see just how worried I was. but I told her that I wished that I could go with them to Scotland in the morning. All the talk of the possibility of impending doom and destruction had affected me more than I had originally thought and it was with a great reluctance that I accepted the fact it was time to go home. \u0027I\u0027ve got to go, Michelle,\u0027 I said quietly. She got up from her seat and hugged me tightly. Inexplicably, tears began to well up in my eyes and I tried to brush them away as discreetly and nonchalantly as was possible. \u0027I\u0027ll call you when we get to Uncle George\u0027s,\u0027 she said. \u0027And don\u0027t worry about those two, they\u0027ll be all right.\u0027 I nodded and kissed my sister lightly on the forehead. We hugged again as Mom returned from the living-room. \u0027Have you really got to go now, love?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I\u0027m afraid so,\u0027 I replied and I moved across the room to hold Mom tightly. \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 I whispered, \u0027everything\u0027s going to be all right.\u0027 Although I had no way of knowing if what I said was true, settling my family\u0027s nerves seemed to compensate to an extent the guilt I felt from not travelling with them to Scotland. I said goodbye to my father and, as usual, his reply took the form of a couple of grunts aimed in my direction from the armchair in which he remained firmly seated.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/straight-to-you/page-9.html","bookId":2560,"book":{"id":2560,"title":"Straight to You","description":"Storyline: The sun is dying.
