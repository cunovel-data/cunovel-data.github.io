{"id":112150,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The weekend flew by. Although I did little with my time - as usual - the two days that I had away from the office seemed to disappear within the blinking of an eye. It seemed that one minute it was Friday evening and the next it was Monday morning.\n The temperature had risen continually over the two days I had spent at home. I looked back in the morning papers and noticed that it had been increasing almost uniformly at the rate of one degree centigrade each day and on Monday it had climbed to a staggering twenty-six degrees. The only thing that kept me going through the first long day back at the office was the thought of going out for a cool, relaxing drink that night with Mark. Typically, however, things did not go according to plan and at half-past seven I was still rushing to get ready so that I could pick him up at eight.\n My lateness would have normally put me in a bad mood but today, unusually, it did not seem to matter - everything else was going well. Earlier in the day I had telephoned head office. The best part of a week had passed since I had interviewed Samantha and had sent her application up to be processed and I was growing tired of waiting for a decision. Once I had managed to locate the person who was dealing with Samantha\u0027s case (and after they had left me hanging on the telephone line for almost a quarter of an hour) they assured me that everything had been agreed and that the agreements which needed to be signed would be waiting on my desk first thing in the morning. I hoped that a couple of drinks tonight would give me enough confidence and the Dutch courage that I would need to be able to ask her out.\n As I readied myself to leave, I could not help feeling like a lovesick adolescent about to ask his sweetheart to his first school dance. Since seeing Samantha the previous week, I had thought about her almost constantly and I was having difficulty in trying to keep my burgeoning feelings in perspective. Although I felt as if I knew her well, we had only spent a little time together and I knew that I had to try and stop my excited imagination from running away with itself.\n I looked in the wardrobe for something decent to wear and eventually settled on a light T-shirt and a pair of old jeans. Although they were far from fashionable, they were the best clothes I could find which would be comfortable in the searing heat outside. Outside of working hours, I had spent the last week wearing little more than a pair of worn, threadbare shorts and the incredible conditions were starting to become a real worry. It was difficult to believe that it would be November in just over a week\u0027s time and I dared not imagine how hot it might be then.\n When I arrived at Mark\u0027s house, he was sat in the shadows of a downstairs window, waiting impatiently for me. Although I was only fifteen minutes later than planned, he still took every available opportunity to criticise my lack of punctuality.\n The drive to our usual pub took only a couple of minutes but, as we approached, we saw that there were many more people there than was normal for a Monday night. I pulled onto the carpark and the light from my headlamps illuminated crowds of drinkers slumped against the walls of the old building.\n \u0027Christ,\u0027 Mark said. \u0027We\u0027re never going to get served if we stop here.\u0027\n I looked around and could not see a single space in the crowded carpark.\n \u0027What do you want to do?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027We could try somewhere else. I would say we could go back to my place but I really need a drink tonight.\u0027\n I reversed the car back onto the road and pointed it back in the direction from which we had just come. I drove back towards my house.\n \u0027Want to try the Cheshire Cat?\u0027 I asked. It was not our favourite pub but it would do.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 Mark replied. \u0027It would have been quicker for you to have walked there!\u0027\n He was right - I could see the pub from the back of my house. We were there in a couple of minutes as there was little traffic of any note on the usually busy roads. Thankfully, as I was tired and suddenly very thirsty, there were spaces in the carpark.\n The pub\u0027s beer garden (which was normally only used on the very hottest of summer days) was full of people. They sat huddled in groups on makeshift seats around improvised tables and basked in bright illumination from security lamps and from the dull electric light which spilled out through windows. I locked the car and we went inside. It was much quieter there and we were served quickly.\n \u0027A pint of bitter and a pint of mild,\u0027 I said to the barmaid as I dug deep into my pockets in search of money.\n I watched as the large, elderly woman shuffled from one end of the bar to the other in a search for empty pint glasses. She put one glass under the bitter pump in front of me and pulled the heavy handle towards her. For a moment thick brown beer surged from the faucet and into the glass before being replaced with spitting, gassy foam. The barmaid looked to the heavens and rested the half-filled glass on the bar.\n \u0027Barrel\u0027s empty,\u0027 she said apologetically. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, love. I\u0027ll have to get it changed.\u0027\n She grabbed a passing member of staff by the arm and asked him to take care of the problem. She then moved along to her left and poured Mark\u0027s mild from a second, working pump. As soon as his drink was ready and had settled, he took it from the bar and swallowed a large, thirsty gulp. He wiped his mouth dry and looked across at me.\n \u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 he said. \u0027Christ, I really needed that.\u0027\n \u0027Had a hard week?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027No, not really,\u0027 Mark replied \u0027What about you? Anything interesting happened in the last few days?\u0027\n I shrugged my shoulders, racking my brain and trying desperately to think of anything that might be of even the slightest interest to my friend. It was an impossible task - the week had, on the whole, been an utter waste of time.\n \u0027Nothing really. Just your average week.\u0027\n I suddenly remembered the one part of the last seven days which had been worth going to work for and could not help letting a broad smile spread across my face.\n \u0027I met an incredible girl though.\u0027\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 Mark said, his interest having quickly been aroused at the mention of the opposite sex.\n \u0027She\u0027s fantastic,\u0027 I continued. \u0027She\u0027s about to go into business, came into the office after some help with her finances. Honestly, she\u0027s amazing - young, single and really good looking.\u0027\n \u0027And is financial assistance all she\u0027s going to get from you?\u0027 Mark asked, prompting me for a sexist answer. Before I could reply, there was a tap on my shoulder and I turned quickly around to see Samantha stood in front of me. I panicked and prayed that she had not heard me talking about her.\n \u0027Hi, Steve. How are you?\u0027 she asked.\n I picked up Mark\u0027s pint and took a large gulp from it before I could answer. \n \u0027I\u0027m fine. You?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m not too bad. Can I get you a drink?\u0027\n \u0027Let me get you one,\u0027 I mumbled \u0027I was in the middle of a round anyway.\u0027\n Samantha nodded and smiled.\n \u0027Okay, I\u0027ll have half a lager and lime please.\u0027\n I asked the barmaid for the extra drink and, as she was pouring it, a voice floated up from the bowels of the pub cellar which was unintelligible but which was obviously conveying the message that the barrel of bitter had been changed. My pint was finally poured.\n Samantha left us for a moment and I watched her as she walked across the room towards a quiet little table, around which sat two men and a woman, all of a similar age to her. My heart sank as I assumed the obvious (that she was with one of the men) and Mark looked at me with an expression on his face which seemed to be trying to say, \u0027better luck next time\u0027.\n Sam returned and took her drink from me.\n \u0027Do you want to come and join us?\u0027 she asked.\n With the fear that my heart was about to be broken growing more and more intense with each passing moment, I tried to politely decline her invitation.\n \u0027We wouldn\u0027t want to intrude,\u0027 I said, meekly.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry, you won\u0027t,\u0027 she replied. \u0027It\u0027s just my cousin and a couple of his university mates.\u0027\n I felt myself relax and I was sure that my sudden relief must have been clearly visible.\n \u0027To be honest,\u0027 Samantha continued, \u0027I\u0027ll be glad of a little company. All I\u0027ve heard all night is what a great time they\u0027re having at college and how I\u0027ve missed out by not going. It\u0027s starting to get tedious.\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re right, you know. It is good,\u0027 Mark said.\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I interrupted, remembering that I had not introduced him to Samantha. \u0027This is Mark, he lectures at the university so he would say that!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m pleased to meet you,\u0027 he said, smiling broadly.\n \u0027Mark, this is Samantha, the one I\u0027ve...\u0027\n \u0027...the one you\u0027ve been telling me about,\u0027 he interrupted.\n I took an embarrassed sip from my pint and we followed Sam as she walked over to the table where her friends waited. They looked up as we approached.\n \u0027This is Mark and Steve.\u0027 she said to her companions. She turned to me and introduced them. \u0027This is Claire, Daniel and Tom.\u0027\n We sat down. Mark sat in the place where Samantha had been sitting before we had arrived and that meant that I was left sitting opposite her at the far end of the table. Mark immediately struck up a conversation with his fellow academics and, to my delight, that left me free and alone to talk to Sam\n \u0027Have you heard if everything\u0027s been agreed?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I don\u0027t want you to think that I\u0027m being pushy or anything, it\u0027s just that I need to know so that I...\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027Everything\u0027s fine I spoke to head office this afternoon and they\u0027ve assured me that all the forms will be waiting on my desk in the morning. Can you come up and sign them?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t,\u0027 she replied with a look of real disappointment on her face. \u0027I\u0027ve got workmen in the shop all day tomorrow and I\u0027d rather not leave them there on their own.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said, trying desperately to think of a solution to our problem. I had been counting on seeing Samantha again. I suddenly had an idea. \u0027I could bring them over to you in my lunch hour, if that\u0027s all right.\u0027\n \u0027Could you?\u0027 she wondered excitedly. \u0027God, that would be brilliant.\u0027 She thought for a moment. \u0027Isn\u0027t it a bit out of your way though?\u0027\n It was, but I could not let her know that.\n \u0027Not really,\u0027 I lied.\n \u0027I\u0027ll make something to eat, shall I? We can celebrate.\u0027\n I smiled and nodded approval and, as I looked once more into Samantha\u0027s deep and mesmerising eyes, she reached out across the table and gently squeezed my hand.\n The evening progressed enjoyably. Mark was content to sit and talk to Samantha\u0027s friends while I was more than happy to relax and talk to Sam herself. I was equally pleased that she seemed just as happy to spend her time with me.\n The table which we were gathered around was next to a little window, the lead-lined panes of which were open wide but offered virtually no respite from the suffocating heat. Occasionally, a light breeze fluttered into the room but, other than that, the night was still and humid. From my position at the end of the table I could see little outside other than the tops of the roofs of the buildings across the street and the moon burning brightly in the cloudless evening sky.\n We had talked for a good hour (which had seemed to have only taken a few minutes to pass) and both Samantha and I had learned a lot about each other. The questions had not needed to be asked directly, instead we had willingly volunteered information to each other. I felt as if I subconsciously wanted her to know everything about me. Sam had been telling me about her plans to get a mortgage and to buy a home of her own when we were interrupted.\n \u0027...and then, once I\u0027ve got the business really going,\u0027 she said, \u0027I\u0027ll be looking to try and find a little...\u0027 she stopped talking suddenly.\n Through the open window, a hot and heavy wind started to blow indoors. The people gathered around tables and those sitting outside in the carpark quickly became quiet, and a deathly hush settled on the whole building as the jukebox stopped playing. The lights flickered and dimmed.\n For a moment the air was choking and inescapably hot. I struggled to look through the tiny window and see what was happening outside but it was difficult from my awkward vantage point at the end of the table. I watched the sky above the pub and saw that it had slowly begun to change colour. As every pair of eyes in the crowded building strained to look skywards, we watched as the darkness of the sky melted away to become a muddy-red, an ember orange and then a yellow-white. Once the heavens had reached that colour, they worked their way back through the various shades until, moments later, they were back to their normal hue. The wind died, the lights brightened and then, after a second\u0027s silence, the jukebox began to play its thumping music again. Apart from the music, no-one else dared make a sound.\n Mark was the first to speak\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 he said, simply.\n \u0027It was just like last week,\u0027 Sam\u0027s cousin Daniel said. \u0027Scary.\u0027\n The conversation ended as quickly as it had begun while we all paused to gather our thoughts and try and comprehend what we had just witnessed. Although I could not speak for any of the others, the heat and light had shaken me to the core and I was glad of the couple of drinks that I had had earlier to calm my nerves. It was not so much fright, it was more a sense of bewilderment and the lack of any warnings or explanations which had combined to unnerve me.\n \u0027Someone at work said that might happen,\u0027 Mark commented quietly. \u0027He said there could be more as well.\u0027\n \u0027What was it though?\u0027 Daniel asked.\n He shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think anybody knows.\u0027 He thought for a moment and ran his fingers nervously through his hair before speaking again. \u0027There are a few people at the university who are starting to get worried about what\u0027s been happening.\u0027\n I had been staring deep into the bottom of my glass and I looked up to see that all the faces around the table were fixed in Mark\u0027s direction. He seemed uncomfortable and looked at each of us in turn as he continued to speak.\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard it said that things are going to get worse before they get any better.\u0027\n Mark swilled the dregs of his beer around in the bottom of his glass before drinking them down and wiping his mouth. I glanced anxiously across the table at Samantha and she returned my concerned expression. She shuffled to sit upright in her seat and, as she did, her foot rested against my leg. I was glad that she kept it there and did not move away - to feel her body next to mine was welcome and comforting.\n A bell rang out and the landlord of the pub yelled for last orders in a deep, gruff voice. In an instant, the bemused quiet which had been so very evident in the building was replaced with sudden, frenzied activity as people rushed towards the bar to buy one final, nerve-settling drink. Mark nudged my arm.\n \u0027We\u0027d better make a move, mate,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I\u0027ve got a busy day tomorrow.\u0027\n I nodded and stood to move away from the table. Samantha also got up and walked over to me.\n \u0027See you about half past one tomorrow?\u0027 she asked.\n \u0027Is that all right?\u0027 I replied rhetorically.\n \u0027It\u0027s fine,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m looking forward to it.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll help take our minds off all of this,\u0027 I said, gesturing outside.\n Sam smiled and I moved towards her and out of the way so that Mark could get past. Had we been alone, I would have kissed her goodnight but the presence of our friends managed to diminish the self-confidence that the little alcohol which I had consumed had built up within me.\n \u0027It was nice to have met you all,\u0027 Mark said to those who remained seated around the table. \u0027We\u0027ll have to do it again sometime, when it gets a little warmer perhaps!\u0027\n I shook my head in disbelief at my companion\u0027s bizarre sense of humour as he walked past Samantha and myself towards the exit. I said goodbye to Sam\u0027s friends before turning back to say goodnight to her.\n \u0027See you tomorrow then,\u0027 I said, not really wanting to leave. Mark and I walked out towards the carpark but, before we had even reached the door to leave the building, I could not stop myself from turning around and looking at Sam once more.\n I felt as if I was floating on air as we staggered back to the car. Ignorant of the muggy heat and of Mark\u0027s tedious conversation, all that I could think of was the beautiful girl that I had just left. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/straight-to-you/page-6.html","bookId":2560,"book":{"id":2560,"title":"Straight to You","description":"Storyline: \n The sun is dying. \n The temperature around the world is rising by the hour with no sign of any respite.
