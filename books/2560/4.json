{"id":112148,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"I arrived for work on Wednesday morning in no better mood than the one in which I had left the previous evening. A deadly combination of the heat and a distinct want not to go back to the office had led to me tossing and turning for hours in the stifling shadows of the night. As I lay awake, I noticed that once again the temperature had remained as high in the darkness as it had been in the daylight - the disappearance of the sun had again failed to have the cooling effect on the world that it normally would have done.\\n\\n Once more the morning was strangely quiet. For a while I sat next to the open window and looked down onto the street below. As I rested on the windowsill and watched little figures meandering around below me, I wished that I was at home in my new-found favourite position - in my deckchair, on the patio with a cold can of beer in my hand. I thought that if I found myself with any spare cash to invest after pay-day then it would definitely be worth buying shares in one of the local breweries. They seemed to be doing double the business of anyone else in the heatwave.\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t really that much that needed to be done at the office and I would have gone home had it not been for the fact that a customer had telephoned and had decided that they desperately needed to see me. I could not help but think that anyone who would rather come into my cramped office when they could stay outside on such a glorious day, needed treatment. Nevertheless, I knew that I could not avoid the meeting and hoped that the appointment would not last for long.\\n\\n Carol brought the customer\u0027s file in to me at a little before eleven o\u0027clock. The person who needed to see me so urgently was a Samantha Hill and, although I had met her once before, I could not remember very much about her. She was young, single and the niece of Mr Ronald Stanley, one of the wealthiest of the customers that I dealt with. Unlike most of the company\u0027s richer clientele, Mr Stanley managed to be pleasant and obliging despite his riches and I hoped that Miss Hill would follow in her uncle\u0027s footsteps. After the last couple of soul-destroying days, I wasn\u0027t sure if I could cope with any awkward customers.\\n\\n On the stroke of the hour, with admirable punctuality, Carol entered the office and told me that Miss Hill had arrived, I stood up, moved my chair back behind the desk and made sure that I looked presentable. It was far too hot to wear my jacket, but at least I made an effort by rolling down the sleeves of my shirt and checking that my tie was straight. With the office and myself ready to receive company, I walked across to the door to let Miss Hill in.\\n\\n She was nothing like I had imagined her to be. She nervously entered the room and, as we shook hands, I could not stop myself staring into the most beautiful pair of deep blue eyes that I had ever seen. For a moment I was unable to look anywhere else and I became increasingly self conscious as I stared. My throat was dry and I had to clear it before I introduced myself.\\n\\n \u0027Good morning,\u0027 I said, feeling my face redden as I spoke. \u0027I\u0027m Steven Johnson, office manager.\u0027\\n\\n Miss Hill smiled warmly and I gestured towards the desk for her to sit down. I took her jacket from her and once more could not help myself staring as she moved across the room. She wore a short, pastel green skirt which clung tightly to her figure and a white, sleeveless blouse. Her long, straight blond hair was pulled gently away from her face and fell in a loose plait down the centre of her back. As I sat down opposite her she crossed her legs under the desk and folded her hands into her lap.\\n\\n \u0027How are you?\u0027 I asked politely.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine, thank you,\u0027 she replied in a light, breathless voice.\\n\\n \u0027And Mr Stanley?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s fine too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s a good man. I get on well with him.\u0027\\n\\n Miss Hill nodded.\\n\\n \u0027He speaks well of you too. He told me that if I ever needed any financial advice then you were the man to see.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And do you?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Do I what?\u0027 she replied, puzzled.\\n\\n \u0027Need financial advice?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 she said, laughing. She leant down and took a large folder from her bag at the side of her chair. \u0027I\u0027m going into business. It was going to be a partnership but I\u0027ve fallen out with my partner. Unfortunately, things have gone too far for me to pull out now and I wondered if your company might be able to help.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Would Mr Stanley be willing to...?\u0027\\n\\n She interrupted me.\\n\\n \u0027Uncle Ronald\u0027s already been far too kind to me. He helped me buy my property and has lent me some capital. I couldn\u0027t possibly ask him for anything more.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What would you need from us?\u0027 I asked. \u0027What kind of business are you going into?\u0027\\n\\n Miss Hill took various documents from her folder and spread them out on the desk in front of me. They were professionally produced and were of such detail that I could see the exact position of the business as at today\u0027s date. She intended to open a little shop in a quiet suburb of the city which would sell freshly made sandwiches and snacks. All that she needed from me was help so that she could finish equipping the shop and buy the first few weeks\u0027 stock.\\n\\n The business plans and forecasts which Miss Hill showed me were impressive and showed that the venture had real promise. In addition, she held various relevant qualifications and I felt sure from talking to her that she would not enter into any commitment that she could not see her way to completely fulfilling. With the security of rich Uncle Ronald available to bail her out if it was ever required, it seemed that her proposition was a sound one.\\n\\n After having examined all the details, I explained my position clearly to her.\\n\\n \u0027In principle,\u0027 I began, \u0027I can\u0027t see that the company would have any objection to us assisting you.\u0027\\n\\n Miss Hill flashed me a relieved smile and nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Of course, I\u0027ll need to complete the regulatory forms with you and we\u0027ll need to take up references.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That shouldn\u0027t be a problem,\u0027 she said as she sorted through the papers on the desk to find the names and addresses of her referees for me. She handed them over. \\n\\n \u0027Okay then, Miss Hill,\u0027 I said before being interrupted.\\n\\n \u0027Samantha, call me Samantha.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right.\u0027 I said and smiled at her as I searched through the uncoordinated confusion of my untidy desk drawers for the required forms. I watched her as she collected up her papers and put them back into her folder. She was a good-looking and instantly likeable girl. Intelligent and easygoing, she would make the perfect wife for some incredibly lucky man somewhere, I thought. And those eyes...\\n\\n I found the forms that I had been looking for.\\n\\n \u0027Right,\u0027 I said, \u0027this shouldn\u0027t take very long. We\u0027ve just got these questions to complete.\u0027\\n\\n Samantha nodded and pulled her chair closer to the desk. As I opened up the form and took out my pen, she leant across and rested her elbows on the edge of the table. She sighed and looked up at me. Once more, I found myself unable to look away.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 she replied. \u0027It just looks like there\u0027s a lot to get through.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really,\u0027 I said, shrugging my shoulders. \u0027It looks complicated but there\u0027s not that much to do. It\u0027ll only take us a few minutes.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You must be busy. Shall I take it away and do it at home?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no need,\u0027 I said quickly. I was suddenly aware that I did not want her to go. \u0027Honestly, it won\u0027t take that long.\u0027 I thought for a moment before asking, \u0027Why, do you need to go?\u0027\\n\\n Samantha shook her head. \u0027You must have much more important things to do than sit here and fill out forms with me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not really. Besides, doing it now will mean that everything can be agreed that little bit quicker.\u0027\\n\\n As she watched, I filled in her name at the top of the form and asked her address. I looked up from the paper to see that she watched me intently and I felt myself redden involuntarily. She chewed her bottom lip and looked thoughtful for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027This isn\u0027t fair, you know,\u0027 she said, smiling broadly.\\n\\n I was puzzled.\\n\\n \u0027What isn\u0027t fair?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027By the time we\u0027ve finished this form, you\u0027re going to know a lot more about me than I\u0027ll know about you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t want to know about me,\u0027 I said. \u0027There\u0027s nothing much to tell and it\u0027s not that interesting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It still isn\u0027t fair,\u0027 she insisted as she took a pair of round-framed, wire-rimmed spectacles from her bag and put them on. She turned the form around on the desk to look at the questions.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 I said. \u0027Whatever you tell me about you, I\u0027ll tell you about me. Is that better?\u0027\\n\\n She laughed and turned the form back around so that it faced me again. The glasses which she wore complemented her already pretty face and she gently wiped her warm forehead. It was still hot in the office and, as I seemed to be getting even warmer with each passing minute, I checked the window to see if it was fully open. More relaxed, I loosened my tie and rolled up my sleeves again before sitting back in my chair and beginning our question and answer session.\\n\\n \u0027You know my address; where do you live?\u0027 Samantha asked and I told her. She seemed surprised. \u0027That\u0027s only a couple of minutes away from my house,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027I know. I drive past the end of your road on the way to work.\u0027 I cleared my throat before asking my next question. \u0027What about your marital status? Are you married?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m single,\u0027 she replied and I felt an unexpected wave of relief run through my body.\\n\\n \u0027And what about the partner you\u0027ve fallen out with?\u0027 I asked. That was not a question on the form.\\n\\n \u0027Julie. Oh, she was just a friend, not a partner in that sense of the word.\u0027\\n\\n I felt foolish and as if I had been prying but Samantha seemed not to mind. I told her that I was single too.\\n\\n We compared ages (she was three years younger than me), educational backgrounds and qualifications and I found myself becoming increasingly more and more relaxed in her company.\\n\\n Although I could never profess to being a good judge of character, and reading a purpose into other people\u0027s signals and actions was something that I found annoyingly difficult, I felt sure that Samantha was as relaxed and as calm as I had become. I dared think for a moment that she could perhaps be the woman I had been dreaming about for all this time but I quickly tried to dispel such juvenile and unfounded ideas from my mind. I felt stupid and foolish at having entertained them for even a moment. Nevertheless, everything that I had told her had been the truth and I was sure that she had been just as honest with me.\\n\\n We eventually reached the end of the form and I looked up at the clock on the wall. To my surprise, it showed the time to be gone midday. We had been sitting together in the office for over an hour but it seemed as if only a fraction of that time had passed. Samantha noticed the expression on my face and her eyes followed mine up towards the clock.\\n\\n \u0027Oh my god,\u0027 she exclaimed. \u0027I\u0027ve taken up so much of your time. I\u0027m so sorry\u0027\\n\\n Apologetically, she began to pack her documents and notes back into her bag.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said, \u0027there\u0027s nothing that can\u0027t wait here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027You\u0027ve been absolutely great, but I really must go.\u0027\\n\\n My heart sank as she got to her feet and took her jacket down from the hook on the wall. I helped her put it on before opening the door to let her leave.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll get the papers up to head office today. I can\u0027t see that they\u0027ll have any problems with anything and so long as your references check out we\u0027ll be in business.\u0027\\n\\n Samantha smiled broadly and held out her hand. I shook it gently. Her palm was warm and her fingers soft and gentle.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks again, you really have been brilliant,\u0027 she said and she stared at me, hypnotising me with her gaze.\\n\\n \u0027As soon as I hear anything, I\u0027ll be in touch.\u0027\\n\\n She left the room. Before I closed the door, she stopped and turned around to face me.\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027re passing, why don\u0027t you call in on your way home one night?\u0027 she said.\\n\\n I tried to maintain my professional integrity and politely decline but it was impossible.\\n\\n \u0027All right, I will,\u0027 I replied, unable to look anywhere but straight into her beautiful face.\\n\\n \u0027See you soon then,\u0027 she said and I watched as she left the building, taking my heart with her.\\n\\n For the rest of the day, it was impossible for me to even try and concentrate on any of my work. All that I could think about was the young girl who had breezed into my office and blown me away. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/straight-to-you/page-4.html","bookId":2560,"book":{"id":2560,"title":"Straight to You","description":"Storyline: The sun is dying. \\n The temperature around the world is rising by the hour with no sign of any respite.
