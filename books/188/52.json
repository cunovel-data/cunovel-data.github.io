{"id":5862,"no":52,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 10","content":"Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer. Herbert\u0027s critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the removal prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter could not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of the result. The cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some branches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the unconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Pencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.\n What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for a moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur a few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his wounds. He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed. There was nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration? why was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this time, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been the theater.\n It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who was watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of the pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was not enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get up to Granite House, where at least he was in safety.\n But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the convicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn his master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the corral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th of November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days since Neb had had other news than that brought by Top--disastrous news: Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!\n What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to fear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the buildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened him?\n Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew the orang\u0027s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof. Jup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced before him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven the cart thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The active orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of which the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.\n Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup\u0027s neck, he brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,--\n \"Jup Jup! corral, corral!\"\n The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach, and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts\u0027 attention having been in the least excited.\n \"You did well, Neb,\" said Harding, \"but perhaps in not warning us you would have done still better!\"\n And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery the removal had so seriously checked.\n Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the beach. Not knowing the number of the island\u0027s inhabitants, they might suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have remembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave themselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,--plundering, burning, devastating everything,--and only retiring half an hour before the arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.\n On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though in vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.\n Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater misfortunes.\n Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster.\n It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of Granite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not have escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the other side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive any suspicious indications.\n Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.\n In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.\n In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait on opportunity to recommence the attack.\n It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear the island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert\u0027s condition. Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.\n The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not suffered less.\n The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a store of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.\n As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable, the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters of the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.\n Cyrus Harding\u0027s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word. Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which still rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.\n The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed on the island! Herbert\u0027s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that a more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological disturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!\n In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks were the only remedies at the colonists\u0027 disposal. The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at regular intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of December.\n The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and tremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst intense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly five hours.\n Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any cost before it should assume a more serious aspect.\n \"And in order to cure it,\" said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, \"we need a febrifuge.\"\n \"A febrifuge--\" answered the engineer. \"We have neither Peruvian bark, nor sulphate of quinine.\"\n \"No,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"but there are willows on the border of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a substitute for quinine.\"\n \"Let us try it without losing a moment,\" replied Cyrus Harding.\n The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently necessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no means for extracting its essence.\n Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and reduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to Herbert.\n The night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return either during the following day.\n Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.\n It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom alarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert\u0027s liver became congested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was also affected.\n Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the engineer aside.\n \"It is a malignant fever,\" said he.\n \"A malignant fever!\" cried Harding. \"You are mistaken, Spilett. A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must previously have existed.\"\n \"I am not mistaken,\" replied the reporter. \"Herbert no doubt contracted the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a third, he is lost.\"\n \"But the willow bark?\"\n \"That is insufficient,\" answered the reporter, \"and the third attack of a malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always fatal.\"\n Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would have gone mad.\n It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered during the day of the 7th of December and the following night.\n Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was terrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to die! The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft away.\n The fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive a third.\n The night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which went to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts, he called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious being,--that powerful unknown protector,--whose image was stamped upon his mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely prostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy was dead.\n The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting fits. Herbert\u0027s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from it.\n \"If before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic febrifuge,\" said the reporter, \"Herbert will be dead.\"\n Night arrived--the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who was loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed against this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.\n During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more violent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected, and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.\n Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was exhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.\n Towards three o\u0027clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry. He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him, terrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.\n Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.\n All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.\n It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in at the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this day was to be poor Herbert\u0027s last!\n A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.\n Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.\n On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these words:-- \"SULPHATE OF QUININE.\"\n 现在移民们不再考虑罪犯们给“花岗石宫”所带来的危害和高地所遭到的破坏了。赫伯特的病情十分危急，大家没有心思顾及其他的事情。这次移动的结果会不会引起致命的内伤呢？通讯记者不敢断定，可是他和他的伙伴们几乎已经绝望了。大车来到河道拐弯的地方。他们用树枝做了一个担架，把不省人事的赫伯特连垫子一起放在上面。十分钟以后，赛勒斯·史密斯、史佩莱和潘克洛夫来到了峭壁下，让纳布把大车带到眺望岗的高地上去。升降梯往上升起，不久以后，赫伯特就躺在“花岗石宫”里自己的床上了。\n 他们费尽了多少心机才使他苏醒过来。他醒来时发现已经在自己房间里了，干是他微微一笑，但是由于过度虚弱，他连一句话也说不出来。他的伤处本来就没有完全收口，吉丁·史佩莱怕创口重新迸发，就检查了一下，所幸创口并没有开裂。那么，怎么会产生这种虚脱现象的呢？赫伯特的病情怎么会恶化到这个程度的呢？刚检查完，少年就由于高烧而昏睡过去了。通讯记者和潘克洛夫一直没有离开他的床边。这时候，史密斯把畜栏里发生的事情全都告诉了纳布，纳布也向主人叙述了高地上发生的情况。\n 罪犯们只是在昨天夜里才在森林边缘甘油河的渡口出现的。当时纳布正在家禽场附近了望，他看见有一个海盗打算渡河。就毫不犹豫地放了一枪，可是在黑暗中，他不知道打中了没有。无论如何，匪徒们并没有被这一枪吓跑，纳布差点没来得及退到“花岗石宫”上去，在“花岗石宫”里他至少是安全的。\n 可是，他该怎么办呢？罪犯们眼看就要破坏高地了，怎样去阻止他们呢？他能想法子通知他的主人吗？此外，畜栏里的人当时处在什么情况之下呢？赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们是11月11日动身的，现在已经29日了。十九天来，纳布所得到的唯一的讯息，就是托普送来的坏消息：艾尔通失踪了，赫伯特身受重伤，工程师、通讯记者和水手被围困在畜栏里！\n 怎么办呢？可怜的纳布不禁要问自己。他本人并不怕什么，因为罪犯们是没法到“花岗石宫”上来的。可是他们的建筑物、农场和所有的布置都要任凭海盗们糟蹋了！要是能让赛勒斯·史密斯去考虑应该怎么办，至少让他知道可能遇到的危险，那样不是更好吗？\n 接着纳布想到可以利用杰普，就写了一封信让它带着。他知道猩猩非常聪明，这是许久以来就已证明了的。他们常向它提到“畜栏”，因此杰普懂得这两个字的意思，大家也许还记得，它经常陪潘克洛夫一起驾车到畜栏去。这时天还没有亮，机灵的猩猩会想法子偷偷地穿过森林的；再说即使罪犯们发现了它，也不过把它当作一个猩猩罢了。\n 纳布没有犹豫。他写好了信，系在杰普的脖子下面，然后把猩猩带到“花岗石宫”门口，把一根长绳子放到地面；接着，他重复了好几遍：\n “杰普，杰普！畜栏，畜栏！”\n 猩猩明白了他的意思，它抓住绳子，敏捷地滑到海滩上，随后就在黑暗中消失了，丝毫也没有惊动罪犯们。\n “做得对，纳布，”史密斯说，“可是，假如不通知我们，也许要更好一些！”\n 赛勒斯·史密斯所以这样说，是因为想到了赫伯特，由于这次迁移，严重地妨碍了他的复原。\n 纳布讲完了。罪犯们一个也没有到沙滩上来。他们摸不清岛上有多少人，也许还以为有一个相当大的部队在防卫“花岗石宫”呢。他们一定还记得：在双桅船进攻的时候，山石的高处和低处，都有很多的枪弹向他们打来；他们一定认为这些人现在是有意不暴露行踪。可是眺望岗的高地却没有“花岗石宫”的炮火掩护，他们可以随便上去。于是他们就大肆破坏起来，他们抢劫、放火、捣毁一切，直到移民们回来以前半小时，才离开高地。当时他们以为移民们还困守在畜栏里呢。\n 他们走了以后，纳布急忙跑出来。他冒着暴露自己甚至被打死的危险，爬上高地，想扑灭吞没家禽场建筑物的火焰；虽然并没有什么效果，但他还是坚持和大火斗争，直到大车来到森林的边缘时才住手。\n 这就是事情的经过。罪犯们的存在，永远是林肯岛居民的一个危险的祸根。他们过去一直生活得非常愉快，可是从现在起，却可能还要遭到更大的不幸。\n 史佩莱和潘克洛夫留在“花岗石宫”里，和赫伯特在一起，赛勒斯·史密斯在纳布的陪伴下，要亲自去看一下这次破坏波及的范围。\n 侥幸的是，罪犯们没有到“花岗石宫”的脚下来。否则“石窟”的工场就难免要遭到破坏了。可是，从另一方面说，即使“石窟”遭到破坏，比起眺望岗来，所受的损失还是比较容易弥补的。史密斯和纳布向慈悲河走去，爬上河的左岸，并没有发现罪犯的踪迹；在河的对岸和丛林深处，也没有发现任何可疑的迹象。\n 现在大致有两种可能：一种可能是罪犯们在畜栏路上看见居民，知道他们回“花岗石宫”了；另一种可能是他们破坏了高地以后，就深入啄木鸟林，沿着慈悲河逃跑了，因此不知道居民们回来。\n 如果是第一种情况，他们一定又回畜栏去了，因为那里现在没有人防守，却有许多贵重的东西。\n 如果是第二种情况，他们一定回到了他们安身的地方，等待机会，准备重新进攻。\n 因此，居民们如果采取守势，是不成问题的。可是现在任何进一步肃清岛上匪徒的计划，都由于赫伯特的病情而搁浅了。的确，虽然以他们的全部力量来说，还勉强能对付这帮罪犯，可是现在谁也离不开“花岗石宫”。\n 工程师和纳布来到了高地。到处是一片荒凉的景象。田地被践踏了，眼看就要成熟的麦穗倒在地上。农场的其他部分也遭到了同样的损失。\n 菜园也被破坏了。幸而“花岗石宫”里还保存着一部分种籽，以后是能够把菜园恢复起来的。\n 家禽场的外壁和建筑物，以及野驴的厩房，都被大火烧毁了。一些受惊的动物在高地上彷徨着。焚烧时躲在湖上的飞禽，又回到老地方来，正在岸边戏水。一切都可以重新建设起来。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯的脸色显得比平时苍白，他感到很难压下心头的怒气，可是他一句话也没有说。他又看了一眼破坏了的田地和火场里还在往上升的余烟，然后回“花岗石宫”去了。\n 以后的几天是移民们在荒岛上所过的最悲痛的日子！赫伯特显然变得更虚弱了。看样子好象是由于严重的生理失调，而将要暴发一种更厉害的疾病。史佩莱担心自己没有力量和这种恶化的病势进行斗争！\n 事实上，赫伯特几乎一直在昏迷状态中，神经错乱的症状也开始出现了。移民们唯一的药品就是清凉的饮料。热度现在还不太高，可是不久以后，大概就要每隔一个时期发一次烧了。果然，12月6日那天，吉丁·史佩莱第一次发现这种情况。\n 可怜的少年手指和耳鼻都变得十分惨白，起初他微微有些打颤，浑身起了鸡皮疙瘩，不住地哆嗦着。他的脉搏既微弱又不正常，皮肤非常干燥，他感到口渴得厉害。然后马上就是一阵痉挛；他的脸上发着高烧，皮肤通红，脉搏也加快了，然后出了一身大汗，热度好象也随着降低了。这一阵发作几乎持续了五个钟头。\n 吉丁·史佩莱始终没有离开赫伯特。很明显，少年染上疟疾了。必须不惜任何代价进行医疗，以免病况进入更加严重的局面。\n “要想把病医好，”史佩莱对赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我们必须取得一种退热药。”\n “一种退热药……”工程师说，“我们既没有奎宁树皮，也没有硫酸奎宁，不是吗？”\n “不错，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可是湖边有柳树，也许柳树皮可以作奎宁的代用品。”\n “我们赶快抓紧时间试试吧。”赛勒斯·史密斯说。\n 的确，柳树皮和七叶树皮、冬青树叶以及蛇根草等一样，巳经被合理地当作奎宁皮的代用药了。它虽然没有奎宁皮那样名贵，显然还是有必要试一试的。由于没法提取它的精华，他们只好不经过加工就拿来使用。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯从一棵黑柳树上削下几片树皮，带回“花岗石宫”，把它们捣成碎末，当晚就让赫伯特吃下去了。\n 这一夜没有发生什么重大变化，就这样过去了。赫伯特的神经有些错乱，可是夜里并没有发烧，第二天白天热度也没有上升。\n 潘克洛夫又恢复希望了。吉丁·史佩莱却什么也没有说。也许发烧不是每天的，而是隔日一次，要再过一天才会复发，因此，他万分焦急地等待着下一天。\n 有一点可以看得出，在这期间，赫伯特完全陷入了虚脱状态，他的头部无力而眩晕。还有一个症状使通讯记者大吃一惊，赫伯特的肝脏充血了，不久以后，他的神经错乱得更加厉害，说明他的大脑也受了影响。\n 吉丁·史佩莱对这个新的共发症简直毫无办法。他把工程师拉在一旁。\n “这是一种恶性疟疾。”他说。\n “恶性疟疾！”史密斯叫道。“你错了，史佩莱。恶性疟疾不会自发产生的；一定要事先有这种病菌潜伏着才能够发病。”\n “我没有弄错，”通讯记者说。“赫伯特一定是在荒岛的沼泽地带感染上这种病菌的。他已经发作了一次；如果再发一次，而我们又没法防止第三次的话，他就要完了。”\n “可是柳树皮呢？”\n “那不顶用，”通讯记者答道，“如果不用奎宁防止恶性疟疾的第三次发作，那是一定要丧命的。”\n 幸亏潘克洛夫没有听见这场谈话，要不然他真要疯了。\n 12月7日的白天和这一夜晚，工程师和通讯记者多么着急是不难想象的。\n 将近中午的时候，第二次发作又来了。这一关是非常可怕的。赫伯特觉得自己瘫痪下去了。他把胳膊伸给赛勒斯·史密斯、史佩莱和潘克洛夫。小小的年纪就要死去，未免太早了！这真是令人心碎的一个场面。他们只好把潘克洛夫打发到别处去。\n 痉挛延续了五个钟头。很明显，赫伯特再也经不起第三次的打击了。\n 这一夜是凄惨可怕的。在神经错乱的状态中，赫伯特含含糊糊地说了几句话，这几句话打动了伙伴们的心弦。原来他在和罪犯们斗争，他叫唤着艾尔通，他不断地恳求那个神秘的人——那个神通广大的不知名的保卫者，他的形象已经铭记在赫伯特的脑海里了。然后，他耗尽了体力，又陷入了完全虚脱的状态。有几次吉丁·史佩莱以为这个可怜的少年已经死了。\n 第二天是12月8日，赫伯特成天在昏迷的痉挛状态中度过。他那骨瘦如柴的双手紧紧地抓着床上的被单。他们又给他吃了一些捣碎的树皮末，可是通讯记者并没有抱什么希望。\n “如果在明天一早以前还没有比较有效的退热药给他吃，”通讯记者说，“赫伯特就非死不可了。”\n 黑夜来临了，这可能是这位善良、勇敢而又聪明的少年的最后一夜了。以他的年龄来说，他在哪方面都显得出类拔萃，人人都象爱护自己的孩子一样地喜爱他；然而今天晚上，他的命运太难令人乐观了。唯一能够医治这种可怕的恶性疟疾的药品，唯一能够起死回生的特效药，却不是林肯岛上所能找到的。\n 12月8日夜间，赫伯特精神错乱得更加严重。肝脏充血达到可怕的程度，大脑也受到了感染，他已经认不清任何人了。\n 病情第三次发作时，他肯定是要死了。他还能活到第二天吗？恐怕不能了。他已经耗尽了体力，在发烧的间歇期间，他就象死人似的躺在那里。\n 夜里三点钟的时候，赫伯特发出一声尖叫，好象是由于极度的痉挛撕裂了他的身体似的。纳布当时离他不远，听见以后吓了一跳，急忙向伙伴们所在的房间里跑去。\n 这时候，托普也莫名其妙地大叫起来。\n 大家急忙冲进屋去，想使垂死的少年平静下来。这时赫伯特几乎要滚下床铺，史佩莱抓住他的胳膊，感到他的脉搏逐渐加快了。\n 这时候是早上五点钟。初升的太阳开始照进“花岗石宫”的窗户。它告诉人们，这是一个晴朗的日子，可是这却是可怜的赫伯特的最后一天了：\n 一线阳光照亮了床边的一张桌子。\n 潘克洛夫突然指着桌子上的一件东西，惊叫一声。\n 桌上放着一个长方形的匣子，标签上写着：\n “硫酸奎宁”。\n
