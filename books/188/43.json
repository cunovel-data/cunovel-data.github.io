{"id":5853,"no":43,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 1","content":"It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no communication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter had attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to a bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that was a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton, alone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to join the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October, other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that deserted sea!\\n\\n There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she pass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would definitely know what to expect.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them what had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the horizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic negative,--\\n\\n \"I\u0027m blessed but it is really a vessel!\" he exclaimed, in a voice which did not express any great amount of satisfaction.\\n\\n \"Is she coming here?\" asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n \"Impossible to say anything yet,\" answered Pencroft, \"for her rigging alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.\"\\n\\n \"What is to be done?\" asked the lad.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" replied Harding.\\n\\n And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to all the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which were aroused by this incident--the most important which had occurred since their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not in the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly contending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and incessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries. Pencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and so rich, would not have left their island without regret. They were accustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship brought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land. It was bringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply their hearts were moved at the sight!\\n\\n From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the window. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was at a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet, therefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have been visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by Mount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel\u0027s lookout. But why was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor Island, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made by Herbert.\\n\\n \"Can it be the \u0027Duncan\u0027?\" he cried.\\n\\n The \"Duncan,\" as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan\u0027s yacht, which had left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch him. Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but that a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in latitude.\\n\\n \"We must tell Ayrton,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"and send for him immediately. He alone can say if it is the \u0027Duncan.\u0027\"\\n\\n This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House, sent this telegram:--\"Come with all possible speed.\"\\n\\n In a few minutes the bell sounded.\\n\\n \"I am coming,\" replied Ayrton.\\n\\n Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.\\n\\n \"If it is the \u0027Duncan,\u0027\" said Herbert, \"Ayrton will recognize her without difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.\"\\n\\n \"And if he recognizes her,\" added Pencroft, \"it will agitate him exceedingly!\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered Cyrus Harding; \"but now Ayrton is worthy to return on board the \u0027Duncan,\u0027 and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan\u0027s yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are ill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to our island.\"\\n\\n \"We could defend it,\u0027, cried Herbert.\\n\\n \"No doubt, my boy,\" answered the engineer smiling, \"but it would be better not to have to defend it.\"\\n\\n \"A useless observation,\" said Spilett. \"Lincoln Island is unknown to navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do you think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding herself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than avoid it?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" replied Pencroft.\\n\\n \"I think so too,\" added the engineer. \"It may even be said that it is the duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet known, and Lincoln Island is in this position.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Pencroft, \"suppose this vessel comes and anchors there a few cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?\"\\n\\n This sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus Harding, after some moments\u0027 thought, replied in the calm tone which was usual to him,--\\n\\n \"What we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:--we will communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we will leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name of the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic with a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!\"\\n\\n \"Hurrah!\" exclaimed Pencroft, \"and that will be no small present which we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost finished; names are given to every part of the island; there is a natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and manufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe Lincoln Island on the maps!\"\\n\\n \"But if anyone seizes it in our absence?\" observed Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n \"Hang it!\" cried the sailor. \"I would rather remain all alone to guard it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn\u0027t steal it from him, like a watch from the pocket of a swell!\"\\n\\n For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was nearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not determine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the wind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea being calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows were not marked on the chart.\\n\\n Towards four o\u0027clock--an hour after he had been sent for--Ayrton arrived at Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,--\\n\\n \"At your service, gentlemen.\"\\n\\n Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading him to the window,--\\n\\n \"Ayrton,\" said he, \"we have begged you to come here for an important reason. A ship is in sight of the island.\"\\n\\n Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim; then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see nothing.\\n\\n \"Take this telescope,\" said Spilett, \"and look carefully, Ayrton, for it is possible that this ship may be the \u0027Duncan\u0027 come to these seas for the purpose of taking you home again.\"\\n\\n \"The \u0027Duncan!\u0027\" murmured Ayrton. \"Already?\" This last word escaped Ayrton\u0027s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.\\n\\n Did not twelve years\u0027 solitude on a desert island appear to him a sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned, either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?\\n\\n \"No,\" said he, \"no! it cannot be the \u0027Duncan\u0027!\"\\n\\n \"Look, Ayrton,\" then said the engineer, \"for it is necessary that we should know beforehand what to expect.\"\\n\\n Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a word. Then,--\\n\\n \"It is indeed a vessel,\" said he, \"but I do not think she is the \u0027Duncan.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Why do you not think so?\" asked Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n \"Because the \u0027Duncan\u0027 is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel.\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps she is simply sailing,\" observed Pencroft. \"The wind is favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.\"\\n\\n \"It is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,\" answered Ayrton, \"and that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.\"\\n\\n So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent. The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no part in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it impossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were particularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one place. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual calm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the engineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared rather than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore, reasonable to believe that the engineer\u0027s apprehensions would not be justified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger.\\n\\n Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and top- gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind was from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary to ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon--a provoking circumstance, for it was already five o\u0027clock in the evening, and the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.\\n\\n \"What shall we do when night comes on?\" asked Gideon Spilett. \"Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?\"\\n\\n This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still retained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative. During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this ship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island? Who could foresee what the future would then have in store for the colonists?\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said the reporter, \"we ought to make known to that vessel, whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the opportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting regrets.\"\\n\\n It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port Balloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense fire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the brig.\\n\\n But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave Granite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood directly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached rapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the glass was put into Ayrton\u0027s hands, that he might ascertain for certain whether the ship was or was not the \"Duncan.\" The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only five miles.\\n\\n The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton soon let the glass fall again, saying--\\n\\n \"It is not the \u0027Duncan\u0027! It could not be!\"\\n\\n Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to say.\\n\\n \"And yet,\" added the sailor, \"a flag is floating from her peak, but I cannot distinguish the colors of it.\"\\n\\n \"In half an hour we shall be certain about that,\" answered the reporter. \"Besides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the latest, we shall make his acquaintance.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind!\" said Pencroft. \"It is best to know whom we have to deal with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow\u0027s colors!\"\\n\\n And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig\u0027s ensign hung in folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.\\n\\n \"It is not the American flag,\" said Pencroft from time to time, \"nor the English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would say it was all one color. Let\u0027s see: in these seas, what do we generally meet with? The Chilean flag?--but that is tri-color. Brazilian?--it is green. Japanese?--it is yellow and black, while this--\"\\n\\n At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a hoarse voice,--\\n\\n \"The black flag!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig, and they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious vessel!\\n\\n Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a pirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas which still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of Lincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a sheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers\u0027 honest domain destined to be transformed into an infamous refuge--the headquarters of the piracy of the Pacific?\\n\\n All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists\u0027 imaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which must be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of pirates! It was that which the \"Duncan\" would have carried, had the convicts succeeded in their criminal design! No time was lost before discussing it.\\n\\n \"My friends,\" said Cyrus Harding, \"perhaps this vessel only wishes to survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is a chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to hide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily seen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also conceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires must be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on the island.\"\\n\\n \"And our vessel?\" said Herbert.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" answered Pencroft, \"she is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy any of those rascals there to find her!\"\\n\\n The engineer\u0027s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton ascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal any indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their companions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff. At the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be at hand in case of an unexpected attack.\\n\\n When all these precautions had been taken,--\\n\\n \"My friends,\" said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, \"if the wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it--shall we not?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Cyrus,\" replied the reporter, \"and if necessary we will die to defend it!\"\\n\\n The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly. Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he, the former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!\\n\\n Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton\u0027s mind, and going to him--\\n\\n \"And you, Ayrton,\" he asked, \"what will you do?\"\\n\\n \"My duty,\" answered Ayrton.\\n\\n He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage.\\n\\n It was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming obscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union Bay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the plateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast bay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter.\\n\\n Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first question. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the second. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and stand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in an hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag without deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these pirates--for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else--already visited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their colors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable peculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as yet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?\\n\\n To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but be seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.\\n\\n However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates were numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this information to he obtained?\\n\\n Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped the island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles of clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on the shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her whereabouts could not be discovered.\\n\\n \"Well! who knows?\" said Pencroft. \"Perhaps that cursed craft will stand off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.\"\\n\\n As if in reply to the sailor\u0027s observation, a bright light flashed in the darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.\\n\\n The vessel was still there and had guns on board.\\n\\n Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.\\n\\n Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.\\n\\n At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the hawse-holes.\\n\\n The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!\\n\\n 这群遇难的人从气球上掉到林肯岛上来已经有两年半了，在这期间，他们和外界始终没有联系。有一次，通讯记者曾经把他们所在的地点写在一封信里，让一只鸟把信带到大陆上去，但这仅仅是个机会，不能对它抱很大的希望。艾尔通是唯一参加到小队里来的人，当时的情况已经叙述过了。在10月17日那天，在这荒凉的海岛上，忽然出乎意料地望见了另外一些人。\\n\\n 这是铁一般的事实！那边有一只船！它是路过这里，还是要来靠岸呢？究竟是什么情况，几个钟头以后，居民们就可以知道了。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和赫伯特立刻把吉丁·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布喊到“花岗石宫”的餐厅里来，告诉他们发生了什么事。潘克洛夫拿起望远镜，很快地在水平线上扫视了一下，然后停在他们所指的一点上，也就是照相底片上模糊不清的那一点。\\n\\n “谢天谢地！真是一只船！”他喊道，但是他并没有带着十分满意的口气。\\n\\n “它是向这儿开吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。\\n\\n “现在还很难说，”潘克洛夫回答说，“因为只有桅杆露在水平线上，船身还一点看不见呢。”\\n\\n “该怎么办呢？”少年问道。\\n\\n “等着吧。”史密斯回答说。\\n\\n 居民们沉默了很久，这是他们来到林肯岛以后遇到的最重要的一次事件。他们沉浸在这件事情所引起的一切思想、感情、恐惧和希望里。当然，居民们所处的环境和一般流落在荒芜小岛上的难民还不一样，那些人经常要为艰苦的生存和残酷的自然进行斗争，并时常会由于思乡而感到苦闷。可是在这里，特别是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们感到既愉快，又富裕；因此，假如有一天真的要离开这个荒岛，他们甚至会感到遗憾的。居民们依靠他们的智慧，把这片土地开发了。他们已经过惯了这里的新生活。但是这只船无论如何是从大陆、甚至可能是从他们的家乡带来消息的。它将要给他们带来同伴；因此，在看见船的时候，他们内心的激动是可以想象的！\\n\\n 潘克洛夫靠在窗口，不时拿起望远镜。从这时候起，他一直注视着那只船。它的位置在东面二十海里的海面上。由于距离相当远，移民们还没有办法发信号。信号旗是没法看见的，枪声也不可能听见，甚至点起烽火来，船上也不会看到。但是有一点是可以肯定的，那就是：这个高耸着富兰克林山的海岛绝对逃不了船上守望者的视线。可是这只船到这儿来干什么呢？纯粹是偶然来到这里的吗？太平洋的这个区域在地图上除了达抱岛以外，并没有其他的陆地，而达抱岛本身又不在从波里尼西亚群岛、新西兰和美国海岸启航的船只经常跑过的航线以内。这个问题人人都在考虑，赫伯特突然作了回答。\\n\\n “这会不会是邓肯号呢？”他大声说。\\n\\n 前面已经说过，邓肯号是格里那凡爵士的游船，它曾经把艾尔通遗弃在小岛上，日后还要来把他接回去。达抱岛离林肯岛并不太远，经线距离只有一百五十英里，纬线距离只有七十五英里，在林肯岛上还可以望见向那个岛驶去的船只。\\n\\n “我们一定要告诉艾尔通，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“立刻把他喊来。只有他能告诉我们这只船是不是邓肯号。”\\n\\n 大家都表示同意，于是通讯记者就跑到联系畜栏和“花岗石宫”的电报机旁，发了—个电报：“速来。”\\n\\n 几分钟后，铃响了。\\n\\n 艾尔通的回电是：“即来。”\\n\\n 于是居民们继续守望着船只。\\n\\n “假如是邓肯号，”赫伯特说，“艾尔通是能毫不困难地认出来的，因为他在那只船上呆过一个时期。”\\n\\n “假如艾尔通认出了它，”潘克洛夫接着说，“他一定会非常激动的！”\\n\\n “是的，”赛勒斯·史密斯说：“但愿这真是格里那凡爵士的游船，艾尔通现在已经够得上回邓肯号去了。不过我担心可能是别的船。这一带海面是歹人出没的地方，我总怕海盗会到我们的岛上来。”\\n\\n “我们可以防御。”赫伯特叫道。\\n\\n “那当然，孩子，”工程师含笑说，“要是能不防御，那不是更好吗？”\\n\\n “这样推论是没有必要的，”史佩莱说。“航海的人不知道有林肯岛，连最新的地图上也没有把它标志出来。不过，赛勒斯，一只船无意之中发现了新的陆地，它只会去察看而不会错过的，你说是不是？”\\n\\n “当然。”潘克洛夫答道。\\n\\n “我也这么想，”工程师补充道。“甚至可以这样说：访问和察看还没被人发现的陆地或岛屿，这是船长的责任。而林肯岛正是一个这样的海岛。”\\n\\n “那么，”潘克洛夫说，“假如这只船来了，并且就在离我们的岛几锚链的地方下了锚，我们该怎么办呢？”\\n\\n 这个突如其来的问题一时没有得到回答。赛勒斯·史密斯考虑了一会儿，然后和往常一样，用镇静的口气答道：\\n\\n “怎么办？朋友们，应该这么办：我们要和船上取得联系，我们代表美国占有这个岛，然后乘这只船离开这里，将来再同愿意跟我们来的人回到岛上，明确地占领它，把太平洋上的这个有用的基地贡献给美利坚合众国。”\\n\\n “哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我们送给国家的这份礼物可不小啊！开拓的手续差不多已经完了：岛上的每一部分都命了名，这里有天然港口、贮水场、道路、电报设备、船坞和一些制造场。只差把林肯岛标志在地图上了。”\\n\\n “但是，假如有人乘我们不在的时候来夺取它呢？”吉丁·史佩莱说。\\n\\n “该死！”水手喊道。“我宁可一个人留下来守着它。你们把这个任务交给我潘克洛夫吧，他们决不能象扒手那样把荒岛从我手里抢走的！”\\n\\n 一个钟头过去了，然而还不能确定这只船是不是向林肯岛开来。它近了一些，但是究竟是向着什么方向航行的呢？这一点潘克洛夫不能断定。不过，这时候正刮着东北风，那只船多半是向右方抢风行驶。并且现在向林肯岛开来又恰巧是顺风；海面上风平浪静，虽然地图上没有浅滩的标志，它尽可以放心大胆地开过来。\\n\\n 艾尔通在将近四点钟的时候——在邀请他的一小时之后——来到了“花岗石宫”。他走进餐厅，说：\\n\\n “各位先生，有什么吩咐吗？”\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯照例向他伸出手来，然后把他领到窗口。\\n\\n “艾尔通，”他说，“我们请你来有一件重要的事情。我们发现了一只船。”\\n\\n 起初艾尔通的脸色略微一变．他的眼睛暂时暗淡下来，然后他从窗口探出身去，看了一下水平线，但是什么也没有瞧见。\\n\\n “用望远镜仔细看一下！”史佩莱说，“艾尔通，也许是邓肯号到这里来接你回去了。”\\n\\n “邓肯号！”艾尔通喃喃地说，接着，又不由自主地说道：“这么快就来了吗？”说完以后，他用两手捧着头。\\n\\n 在荒岛上独居了十二年，难道他还认为不足以弥补自己的罪恶吗？这个悔过自新的人，不论他自己看来也好，或是别人看来也好，难道还不觉得他已经得到宽恕了吗？\\n\\n “不，”他说，“不是！决不是邓肯号。”\\n\\n “你瞧，艾尔通，”工程师说，“我们一定要预先知道将要发生什么事。”\\n\\n 艾尔通拿起望远镜，朝着大家所指的方向看去。他默默地对着水平线一动也不动地看了几分钟，然后说：\\n\\n “的确是一只船，但我想不是邓肯号。”\\n\\n “为什么你认为不是邓肯号呢？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。\\n\\n “因为邓肯号是一只游船，而这只船上和周围却连一点烟也看不见。”\\n\\n “也许它是张着帆在行驶，”潘克洛夫说。“它现在的方向好象是顺风，离陆地这么远，它也许打算节省一些煤。”\\n\\n “也许你说得对，潘克洛夫先生，”艾尔通答道，“这只船灭了火。我们只好等它走近一些。那时候就可以知道要发生什么事情了。”\\n\\n 说完以后，艾尔通就在房间的一个角落里坐了下来，不再说话了。移民们又谈起了这只陌生的船，但是艾尔通没有参加谈话。大家的心情都很激动，觉得工作不下去了。吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫特别显得神经过敏，他们不停地走来走去，一会儿也坐不住。赫伯特却感到好奇。只有纳布和平时一样的安静。难道他的主人所在的地方不是他的祖国吗？至于工程师，他正陷入沉思，他的心里与其说是盼望这只船来，还不如说是害怕它来。这时候，船离荒岛近一些了。他们从望远镜里可以确定：这是一只双桅船，而不是太平洋海盗常用的那种帆船。所以，现在不妨肯定：工程师的顾虑是不必要的，这只船在海岛附近出现并不会带来什么危险。潘克洛夫仔细看了一会以后，肯定这是一只双桅船，它张着中桅帆和上桅帆，正沿着右舷，斜对着海岸驶来。艾尔通也肯定了这一点。不过，那时刮的是西南风，要是双桅船继续向着这个方向驶来，它很快就要被爪角挡住的。那时候要守望它就必须爬到气球港附近华盛顿湾的高岗上去。糟糕的是，这时候已经是傍晚五点钟，在苍茫的暮色里，很快就要什么也看不见了。\\n\\n “天黑了我们怎么办呢？”吉丁·史佩莱问道，“要不要到海边去燃起一堆火来，表示我们在这儿呢？”\\n\\n 这是一个重大的问题，虽然工程师还多少保留着他的预感，但最后还是同意了。在夜间这只船也许会一去不复返的，它走了以后，还会有别的船再到林肯岛附近来吗？谁能预见移民们的前途呢？\\n\\n “是的，”通讯记者说，“不管它是什么船，我们都应该让它知道这个岛上有人居住。要是错过这个送上门来的机会，也许要一辈子遗憾的。”\\n\\n 于是大家决定由纳布和潘克洛夫到气球港去。在天黑的时候，燃起一堆火来，这样火光一定会引起船上注意的。\\n\\n 但是，纳布和水手正准备离开“花岗石宫”，那只船忽然改变了方向，直对联合湾驶去了。它驾驶得很熟练，很快就接近了海岸。于是，纳布和潘克洛夫暂时不走了。大家把望远镜交给艾尔通，让他肯定这只船究竟是不是邓肯号。苏格兰游船邓肯号也是一只双桅船。现在那只船离岸只有十英里了。需要看清楚的是：它的两根桅杆之间有没有烟囱。\\n\\n 水平线上还很清晰。察看起来非常容易。艾尔通很快放下望远镜说：\\n\\n “不是邓肯号！不可能是它！”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫接过望远镜，对着来船。它的载重可以看出在三四百吨之间，船身非常狭窄，樯帆齐整，结构精巧好看，这一定是一只航海的快船。但是究竟是哪一国的船呢，这还很难说。\\n\\n “不过，”水手接着说，“船顶上飘着一面旗，只是我还看不清它的颜色。”\\n\\n “半小时以后就可以确定了，”通讯记者说，“并且，那只船的船长显然是想上岸，因此，不是今天就是明天，我们就可以和他见面了。”\\n\\n “这个倒没有什么关系！”潘克洛夫说，“最好能知道我们要和什么样的人打交道，要是我能认出船旗就好了。”\\n\\n 水手说话的时候，始终没有离开望远镜。天黑了，风也随着停了下来，船上的旗帜垂成一卷，更不容易看清了。\\n\\n “这不是美国旗，”潘克洛夫喃喃地说，“也不是英国旗，如果是英、美的旗帜，红颜色是很容易看出来的。也不是法国旗或德国旗，也不是俄国的白旗，也不是西班牙的黄旗。好象是一面单色旗。让我想一想，在这一带海面上，我们经常遇见的是哪种旗？智利旗吗？那是三色的。巴西旗吗？那是绿的。日本旗吗？那是黄色和黑色的，而这……”\\n\\n 这时候，微风又把这面陌生的船旗吹开了。艾尔通拿起水手放下的望远镜来一看，他暗哑地喊道；\\n\\n “是一面黑旗！”\\n\\n 的确，一面阴沉沉的旗子在桅杆上飘扬着，现在他们不禁对来船感到可疑了！\\n\\n 那么，工程师的预感是不是对了呢？这是一只海盗船吗？它是不是在太平洋上出没，要和横行一时的马来船争霸呢？它到林肯岛沿岸来干什么？他们认为这是一个无名的荒岛，准备把它当作窝藏赃物的仓库吗，它是打算在沿岸找一个过冬的港口吗？难道居民们的这片净土注定了要成为不名誉的藏身所，成为太平洋海盗的巢穴吗？\\n\\n 他们不由地产生这些念头。此外，船旗的颜色当然是值得注意的。这是海盗的旗号！假如当初那批罪犯的罪恶阴谋得逞了的话，邓肯号也会挂上这种旗号的。大家立刻开始谈论起来。\\n\\n “朋友们，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“也许这只船只是想在沿岸巡视一下。也许船上的人根本不会上岸，这也是可能的。但是，不管怎样，我们都必须尽可能隐蔽起来。眺望岗上的风磨太显眼了。艾尔通和纳布快去把风翼落下来。‘花岗石宫’的窗户也必须用树枝密密地遮住。把火全弄灭了，一点也不要暴露出岛上有人的样子来。”\\n\\n “我们的船呢？”赫伯特说。\\n\\n “噢，”潘克洛夫答道，“藏在气球港了，我不信那些流氓能够找到它！”\\n\\n 工程师的命令都立刻执行了。纳布和艾尔通爬上高地，作了必要的戒备，把一切住人的迹象都掩蔽起来。当他们进行这项工作的时候，其他的人到啄木鸟林的边缘去拾了许多树枝和爬藤回来。从远处看起来，它们好象天然的枝叶似的，“花岗石宫”的窗子就这样伪装起来了。同时，枪枝弹药也准备好了，以防突如其来的袭击。\\n\\n 等到一切都准备好以后，史密斯说：\\n\\n “朋友们，”他的声音显得有些激动，“假如这些歹人想要侵占林肯岛，我们一定要保卫它，对不对？”\\n\\n “对，赛勒斯，”通讯记者答道，“必要的时候，我们可以牺牲性命来保卫它！”\\n\\n 工程师向伙伴们伸出手来，大家都热烈地紧握着他的手。\\n\\n 只有艾尔通一个人还蹲在角落里，没有和大家在一起。这个过去的罪犯也许觉得自己还没有资格这样做！\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯猜透了艾尔通的心思，就走到他身旁去。\\n\\n “你，艾尔通，”他问道，“你打算怎样做呢？”\\n\\n “尽我的责任。”艾尔通答道。\\n\\n 于是他站在窗边，从浓密的枝叶间向外看去。\\n\\n 那时正是七点半钟。太阳已经在二十分钟前消失在“花岗石宫”的后面了。因此东方的水平线逐渐朦胧起来。这时候，双桅船继续向联合湾驶去。它驶过爪角以后，就顺着上涨的潮流往北而去，因此，现在它正对着眺望岗的高地，离这里只不过两英里。双桅船这时候可算已经进入了宽广的海湾，假如在爪角和颚骨角之间画一条直线，那么这根线正通过船的右舷后部。\\n\\n 这只船是不是打算深入海湾呢？这是第一个问题。一旦入港以后，会不会在那边抛锚呢？这是第二个问题。最后，它会不会仅仅巡视一下，不让船员们上岸就开走呢？这些，在未来的一个钟头之内，他们都会知道的。但目前只能等待着。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯看了这只挂着黑旗的可疑的船以后，感到很不安心。他和他的伙伴们到现在为止工作得非常顺利，这只船会不会给他们的工作带来威胁呢？这只船的船员们不可能是别的，只可能是海盗，他们是不是曾经到这里来过，因此在驶近荒岛的时候，挂上他们的旗号呢？岛上过去发生过一些不能理解的怪事，这能不能说明他们曾经侵占过这个地方呢？有某些地方居民们还没有去探测过，那里是不是有海盗的同伙准备和船上的海盗联系呢？\\n\\n 史密斯暗暗地考虑着这些问题，不知道应该怎样回答；他只觉得双桅船来了以后，将要对他们的安全带来严重的威胁。\\n\\n 不管怎么样，他和他的伙伴还是决定要战斗到底。目前迫切需要知道：海盗的人数多不多，他们的武器是不是要比移民们装备得优越。但是怎么能得到这个情报呢？\\n\\n 黑夜来临了。新月已经消失。黑暗笼罩着荒岛和海洋。水平线上盖着黑压压的阴云，光线一丝也透不过来。风也随着暮色而消失了。听不见树叶沙沙作响，岸边也没有潺潺的水声。船上的灯火完全熄灭了，因此一点也看不见它。即使它还在荒岛的周围，也找不到它的行踪了。\\n\\n “好吧！谁知道呢？”潘克洛夫说。“也许这只该死的船要在夜里开走，到明天早上我们就找不着它了。”\\n\\n 这时候，黑暗中突然闪出一道亮光，并且传来一声炮响，好象回答水手的问题似的。\\n\\n 船还在那里，并且船上还有炮。\\n\\n 亮光闪过之后六秒钟才听见炮声。\\n\\n 因此，这只船离岸大约一又四分之一英里。\\n\\n 这时候，铁链从链孔里哗啦啦地放了出来。\\n\\n 双桅船在“花岗石宫”的视线内抛锚了。\\n\\n \\n\\n
