{"id":5864,"no":54,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 12","content":"The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration of all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls River. The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as it was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island. One might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or Africa had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them to conclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in its upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which could not belong to a temperate climate. The most frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.\\n\\n But the colonists\u0027 object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would have been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which the first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their island no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the last man.\\n\\n No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully sought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more deserted camps.\\n\\n \"This does not surprise me,\" said Cyrus Harding to his companions. \"The convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam Point, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after crossing Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we took on leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the wood. But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they would discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going northwards again, they came upon the corral.\"\\n\\n \"Where they have perhaps returned,\" said Pencroft.\\n\\n \"I do not think so,\" answered the engineer, \"for they would naturally suppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.\"\\n\\n \"I am of Cyrus\u0027 opinion,\" said the reporter, \"and I think that it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their lair.\"\\n\\n \"Then, captain, straight to the corral!\" cried Pencroft. \"We must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!\"\\n\\n \"No, my friend,\" replied the engineer; \"you forget that we have a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some habitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of gratitude to perform.\"\\n\\n \"That was well said, captain,\" replied the sailor, \"but, all the same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.\"\\n\\n And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable that the stranger\u0027s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.\\n\\n That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was organized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.\\n\\n The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore, where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already partly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the west coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.\\n\\n The engineer\u0027s plan was this:--To minutely survey the valley forming the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations which had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.\\n\\n This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were impatient to regain entire possession of their island.\\n\\n They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river\u0027s bank, became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not venture without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented--nothing announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of trees still hid it.\\n\\n It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it was occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait until night came on.\\n\\n However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience, volunteered to accompany him.\\n\\n \"No, my friends,\" said the engineer, \"wait till night. I will not allow one of you to expose himself in open day.\"\\n\\n \"But, captain--\" answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.\\n\\n \"I beg of you, Pencroft,\" said the engineer.\\n\\n \"Very well!\" replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.\\n\\n The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched the neighboring parts of the forest.\\n\\n Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence reigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a footstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would have been heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying on the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of uneasiness. At eight o\u0027clock the day appeared far enough advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding consented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.\\n\\n \"Do not be imprudent,\" said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, \"you have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is occupied or not.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" answered Pencroft.\\n\\n And the two departed.\\n\\n Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty feet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound, advanced with great caution.\\n\\n They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a less mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment to hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett and Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade.\\n\\n They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of trees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared to be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that any imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims, would fall afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were killed, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?\\n\\n But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.\\n\\n \"In a few minutes it will be quite dark,\" whispered Spilett in the sailor\u0027s ear, \"then will be the time to act.\"\\n\\n Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his energies, and waited, swearing to himself.\\n\\n Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if it issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin rose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night spread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was the time.\\n\\n The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to be absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a little darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number to guard against any surprise.\\n\\n Spilett grasped his companion\u0027s hand, and both crept towards the corral, their guns ready to fire.\\n\\n They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single ray of light.\\n\\n Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had supposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the outer bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the convicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had fastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.\\n\\n Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.\\n\\n Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the goats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of night.\\n\\n The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether they had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral. This would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding\u0027s instructions.\\n\\n It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail. Now, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of the expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance of surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades?\\n\\n This was not the reporter\u0027s opinion. He thought it better to wait until all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate into the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach the palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be guarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return to the cart, where they would consult.\\n\\n Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood.\\n\\n In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs.\\n\\n \"Well,\" said he, after a little thought, \"I now have reason to believe that the convicts are not in the corral.\"\\n\\n \"We shall soon know,\" said Pencroft, \"when we have scaled the palisade.\"\\n\\n \"To the corral, my friends!\" said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n \"Shall we leave the cart in the wood?\" asked Neb.\\n\\n \"No,\" replied the engineer, \"it is our wagon of ammunition and provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.\"\\n\\n \"Forward, then!\" said Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready to fire. Jup, at Pencroft\u0027s orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash, to prevent him from bounding forward.\\n\\n The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating, the little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the dangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers\u0027 heads to hold them. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was open!\\n\\n \"What do you say now?\" asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and Spilett.\\n\\n Both were stupefied.\\n\\n \"I can swear,\" said Pencroft, \"that this gate was shut just now!\"\\n\\n The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when Pencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be doubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them. Were they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?\\n\\n All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists, but how could they be answered?\\n\\n At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked the engineer.\\n\\n \"A light!\"\\n\\n \"In the house?\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\"\\n\\n All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw glimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. \"It is our only chance,\" said he to his companions, \"of finding the convicts collected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power! Forward!\" The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their guns ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the charge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral.\\n\\n In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.\\n\\n Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window, then feebly lighted by the inner light.\\n\\n He gazed into the apartment.\\n\\n On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used by Ayrton.\\n\\n On the bed lay the body of a man.\\n\\n Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--\"Ayrton!\" he exclaimed.\\n\\n Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists rushed into the room.\\n\\n Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great bruises.\\n\\n Harding bent over him.\\n\\n \"Ayrton!\" cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had just found again under such unexpected circumstances.\\n\\n At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then at the others,--\\n\\n \"You!\" he cried, \"you?\"\\n\\n \"Ayrton! Ayrton!\" repeated Harding.\\n\\n \"Where am I?\"\\n\\n \"In the house in the corral!\"\\n\\n \"Alone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\"\\n\\n \"But they will come back!\" cried Ayrton. \"Defend yourselves! defend yourselves!\"\\n\\n And he fell back exhausted.\\n\\n \"Spilett,\" exclaimed the engineer, \"we may be attacked at any moment. Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come back here.\"\\n\\n Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer\u0027s orders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was in the hands of the convicts!\\n\\n In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling sullenly.\\n\\n The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire. Herbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking the corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock the settlers over one after the other.\\n\\n At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of the forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the enclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which watered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From the side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood out white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the enclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart entering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars.\\n\\n But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and rush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.\\n\\n \"Be ready to fire, my friends!\" cried Harding.\\n\\n The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.\\n\\n Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill cries.\\n\\n The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little stream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!\\n\\n They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed on Lincoln Island!\\n\\n 第二天，2月18日，移民们准备探索从爬虫角到瀑布河沿岸一带的森林地区。这一带森林在盘蛇半岛的两岸之间，宽不过三四英里，是可以彻底进行搜索的。这里的树木不但高大，而且枝叶茂盛。可以看得出来，这一带的土壤比荒岛的其他各地肥沃得多。人们也许会以为是从美洲或非洲迁移到这个温带地区来的一部分原始森林。他们推断的结果，认为这些壮丽的树木所生长的地方土壤一定比较热。原来这里的土壤表层潮湿，而内部却由于火山的烈焰，使温度升高了；这种温度在温带气候里，是不可能有的。这一带常见的树木是高大的卡利松和有加利树。\\n\\n 当然，居民们的目的并不仅仅是欣赏优美的林木。他们知道，在这方面林肯岛已经有资格列入最初被称为“快乐群岛”的加那利的第一流岛屿之中了。可是，令人叹息的是，林肯岛已经不完全归他们所有了！已经有匪徒侵占了它，玷污了它的海岸，必须把这帮匪徒消灭得干干净净！\\n\\n 他们搜索得非常仔细，西海岸并没有发现丝毫痕迹。这里连脚印、断技和残留的营地都没有了。\\n\\n “这一点我倒并不感到奇怪，”赛勒斯·史密斯对他的伙伴们说。“罪犯们最初在荒岛的遗物角附近登陆，穿过潦凫沼地以后，他们立刻深入了远西森林。然后他们几乎是循着我们从‘花岗石宫’出发以后所走的道路前进的。这就是我们能在森林里发现踪迹的原因。可是罪犯们从登岸以后很快就发现这一带没有适合居住的地方，因此，才又往北去，以致被他们找到了畜栏。”\\n\\n “也许他们已经回畜栏去了。”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n “我想没有，”工程师说，“因为他们一定会认为我们要向那个方向搜索的。对他们说来，畜栏仅仅是个仓库，而不是可以长期逗留的地方。”\\n\\n “我同意赛勒斯的看法，”通讯记者说，“我想，罪犯们一定把老窝扎在富兰克林山的支脉之间了。”\\n\\n “那么，史密斯先生，立刻到畜栏去！”潘克洛夫叫道。“我们一定要把他们杀光。到现在为止，我们完全是在浪费时间！”\\n\\n “不，我的朋友，”工程师说，“你忘了我们还想知道远西森林里有没有住宅了。我们的远征是有双重目标的，潘克洛夫。一方面我们固然要惩治罪犯，另一方面，我们还要报答别人的恩惠。”\\n\\n “说得对，史密斯先生，”水手说，“可是怎么都一样，我认为在那位先生不愿意露面以前，我们是找不到他的。”\\n\\n 事实上，潘克洛夫一语道破了大家的想法。陌生人的住所大概正和他本人一样的神秘。\\n\\n 这天晚上，大车停在瀑布河口。他们照常组织了露宿，照常进行守夜。赫伯特现在已经又是一个健康而强壮的少年了。这种户外生活，既有海上吹来的微风，又有林间的新鲜空气，对他是有极大好处的。现在他不再坐在车上，而是走在小队的前面了。\\n\\n 第二天，2月19日，移民们离开海岸——在海岸的河口对面，各种玄武岩石堆砌在一起，形成一幅奇形怪状的图案——翻上河的左岸。过去他们常从畜栏到西海岸去，因此这条道路已经有一部分铺平了。居民们现在离富兰克林山还有六英里左右。\\n\\n 工程师的计划是这样的：仔细察看形成河床的山谷，小心向畜栏附近逼近；如果畜栏里有人，就用武力把它夺取过来；如果没有人，就坐守在里面，作为探索富兰克林山的前进据点。\\n\\n 移民们一致同意这个计划，因为他们都急着要光复他们的整个荒岛。\\n\\n 一道峡谷把富兰克林山的两个最大的支脉划分开来，他们就沿着这条峡谷向前走去。河岸上树木丛生，在稍微高些的山坡上就比较稀疏了。这里到处是崎岖的山地，打埋伏最为合适，因此他们前进时十分小心。托普和杰普在两旁的密林里跳来跳去，互相比赛着机智和灵活。夹岸一带没有任何迹象可以说明最近曾经有人来过，没有任何遗物说明这里或附近有罪犯存在。傍晚五点钟的时候，大车在离栅栏不到六百英尺的地方停住了。栅栏被一排围成半圆形的树林遮住了，因此还看不见。\\n\\n 现在必须侦察一下，确定畜栏里有没有人。罪犯们可能就隐藏在附近，如果白天大摇大摆向畜栏走去，那就会和可怜的赫伯特一样，等于送上去让匪徒们打，因此，最好还是等到天黑再说。\\n\\n 可是，吉丁·史佩菜却主张不再耽搁，立刻侦察畜栏的路径；潘克洛夫也忍耐不住了，他自告奋勇陪同通讯记者一起去。\\n\\n “不，朋友们，”工程师说，“还是等到天黑再去吧。我决不让你们任何一个人在大白天暴露自己。”\\n\\n “可是，史密斯先生……”水手还想不答应。\\n\\n “我求求你，潘克洛夫。”工程师说。\\n\\n “好！”水手说，他换了一种方法来发泄心头的愤怒，用船上人常用的最难听的话，辱骂那帮罪犯。\\n\\n 于是居民们留在大车旁边，小心地警戒着森林的周围。\\n\\n 三个钟头就这样过去了。风势减弱下来，大树底下鸦雀无声。即使是折断一根小树枝，脚踩在干枯的树叶上，或是身子从草地上滑一下，都可以听得清清楚楚。一切都是静悄悄的。托普趴在草地里，把头搁在爪子上，也没有表现出不安的样子。八点钟的时候，天色已经很晚，在这种情况下，一般是适合进行侦察的。吉丁·史佩莱表示随时准备和潘克洛夫出发。赛勒斯·史密斯同意了。托普和杰普留下来和工程师、赫伯特、纳布在一起，因为它们如果在不恰当的时候叫起来，是会惊动匪徒的。\\n\\n “不要大意，”史密斯对通讯记者和潘克洛夫说，“你们不必占领畜栏，只要弄清楚里面有没有人就行了。”\\n\\n “好。”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n 于是他们两个人走了。\\n\\n 多亏枝叶茂密，树底下一片漆黑，三四十英尺以外，就什么都看不见了。通讯记者和潘克洛夫非常小心地前进着，一听到任何可疑的声音，马上就停下来。\\n\\n 他们彼此保持着一小段距离前进，这样目标就比较小了。老实说，他们随时都等待着枪声。离开大车五分钟以后，吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫来到森林边缘的空地前面，过了空地，就是畜栏的栅栏了。\\n\\n 他们停了下来。在这块没有树的空地上，还有几丝模糊不清的光线。三十英尺以外就是畜栏的大门，这时候门好象关着。从森林边缘到栅栏之间的这三十英尺是必须通过的，如果借用弹道学上的一个名词，不妨叫它“危险区”。事实上，不论谁闯入“危险区”，只要在栅栏后边放一两枪就可以把他打倒。吉丁·史佩莱和水手并不是临阵胆怯的人，可是他们也知道，如果不小心的话，不仅自己首先要成为牺牲品，而且还会影响他们的伙伴。如果他们被打死了，史密斯、纳布和赫伯特会怎么样呢？\\n\\n 潘克洛夫认为罪犯们一定已经在畜栏里住下了。现在距离畜栏这么近，他一时冲动，就想往前走。通讯记者一手将他牢牢地抓住。\\n\\n “一会儿天就要黑透了，”史佩莱凑近水手的耳边低声说，“那时候再行动。”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫焦躁不安地握着枪托，尽量克制自己激动的心情，一面等待，一面低声诅咒。\\n\\n 不久，最后的一线余光消失了。黑暗好象从浓密的森林中间袭来，笼罩住了空地。富兰克林山仿佛一道庞大的屏障，屹立在西边的水平线上。纬度较低的地方照例是这样，夜色很快地来临。现在是时候了。\\n\\n 通讯记者和潘克洛夫到达森林边线以后，眼睛一直盯着栅栏。畜栏里似乎一个人也没有。栅栏的顶部形成一道直线，比周围的暗处稍微黑一些；可以看得很清楚，栅栏上并没有什么模糊的东西。如果罪犯们在畜栏里，他们一定会留一个人站岗，以防突然遭到袭击的。\\n\\n 史佩莱抓住伙伴的手，一起向畜栏匍匐前进；他们随时都准备开枪。\\n\\n 周围一片漆黑，连一线光也没有；这时候他们来到了畜栏的门口。\\n\\n 潘克洛夫打算把门推开，但是正和他们想象中一样，大门关着。水手发现外边的门闩并没有闩上，因此可以得出这样的结论：罪犯们在畜栏里，他们从里面把门关住，使外面推不开。\\n\\n 吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫听了一会儿。\\n\\n 栅栏里一点声音也没有。摩弗仑羊和山羊一定在牲口棚里睡着了，因此丝毫也没有打破夜晚的宁静。\\n\\n 通讯记者和水手什么也没有听见，他们自己思忖着，是不是应该翻过栅栏，到畜栏里去。不，这样做就违背了赛勒斯·史密斯的指示。\\n\\n 的确，这样冒险是可能成功的，但也可能失败。如果罪犯们现在还没有任何怀疑，如果他们一点也不知道居民们进行远征来搜索他们，就是说，那是有进行突然袭击的机会的；如果轻率地越过栅栏就会失去这样的机会，是不是应该这样做呢？\\n\\n 通讯记者不打算这样。他认为最好还是等居民们聚齐了以后，再向畜栏进攻。有一点是肯定的：他们可以偷偷地走到栅栏前面，并且似乎也没有人在那里把守。这一点现在已经清楚了，就可以回到大车旁边去进行商讨，没有别的可做了。\\n\\n 潘克洛夫大概也同意这个决定，当通讯记者转回森林去的时候，他也不反对，就跟着回来了。\\n\\n 几分钟以后，工程师了解了当前的情况。\\n\\n “好吧，”他想了一会儿，然后说，“我现在有理由认为，罪犯们不在畜栏里。”\\n\\n “等我们翻过栅栏以后，”潘克洛夫说，“就可以证实了。”\\n\\n “到畜栏里去，朋友们！”赛勒斯·史密斯说。\\n\\n “我们就把大车留在森林里吗？”纳布问道。\\n\\n “不，”工程师答道，“它是我们的军火和粮食车，必要的时候，还可以把它当堡垒用。”\\n\\n “那么，前进！”吉丁·史佩莱说。\\n\\n 大车出了森林，静悄悄地向栅栏驶去。这时夜色非常昏暗，周围还是和刚才潘克洛夫与通讯记者爬行的时候一样，没有一点响动。满地都是杂草，因此行走时一点声音也没有。\\n\\n 移民们随时准备开枪。杰普听从潘克洛夫的话，独自留在后面。纳布用一根绳子拴着托普，不让它往前跑。\\n\\n 空地马上就出现在眼前了。这里一个人也没有。小队毫不犹豫地向栅栏走去。一会儿就走过“危险区”了。没有一声枪响。大车到达栅栏前面，停了下来。纳布在野驴前面勒住缰绳。工程师、通讯记者、赫伯特和潘克洛夫向门口走去，看看究竟是不是从里面关的。\\n\\n 有一扇门开着！\\n\\n “这是怎么一回事？”工程师向水手和史佩莱问道。\\n\\n 他们两个人都愣住了。\\n\\n “我敢发誓，”潘克洛夫说，“这扇门刚才是关着的！”\\n\\n 居民们犹豫起来了。潘克洛夫和通讯记者侦察的时候，罪犯们在畜栏里吗？毫无疑问，当时他们是在里面的，因为既然门刚才还关着，那么只能是他们开的。可是现在他们还在里面吗？还是有一个匪徒刚出去呢？\\n\\n 所有这些问题都同时涌进了居民们的脑海，但是怎样才能解答这些问题呢？\\n\\n 赫伯特已经向栅栏走进去几步，这时候突然退回来，抓住工程师的手。\\n\\n “怎么了？”工程师问道。\\n\\n “有亮光！”\\n\\n “屋子里头吗？”\\n\\n “是的！”\\n\\n 五个人一起涌向前去。果然，只见面前的窗户里，有一线微弱的灯光闪动着。赛勒斯·史密斯很快地打定主意。“罪犯们没有怀疑会发生什么事情，他们聚在这个屋子里，现在正在我们的控制之下！这是我们唯一的机会！前进！”居民们手里端着枪，走进栅栏。大车留在外面让杰普和托普看管着。居民们已经小心地把它们拴在车上了。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯、潘克洛夫和吉丁·史佩莱在一边，赫伯特和纳布在另外一边，同时沿着栅栏，在漆黑冷清的畜栏里搜索前进。\\n\\n 他们不久就走近了关着的房门。\\n\\n 史密斯向伙伴们做了一个手势，教他们不要动。然后他走到被室内微弱的灯光照亮的窗子前面。\\n\\n 他向室内张望了一下。\\n\\n 桌上点着一盏灯。桌子旁边是艾尔通过去睡的床铺。\\n\\n 床上躺着一个人。\\n\\n 突然，赛勒斯·史密斯倒退几步，沙哑地喊道：\\n\\n “艾尔通！”\\n\\n 居民们立刻闯进房门，冲到屋里去。\\n\\n 艾尔通好象睡着了。从他的脸色上可以看出，他曾经受过长期而残酷的折磨。他的腕部和踝部都有大片的伤痕。\\n\\n 史密斯向他弯下身来。\\n\\n “艾尔通！”工程师抓住他的胳膊叫道。在这种情况下找到他，真是太想不到了。\\n\\n 艾尔通听见有人喊他，睁开两眼，呆呆地看看史密斯，又看看大家。\\n\\n “你们！”他叫道，“是你们吗？”\\n\\n “艾尔通！艾尔通！”史密斯重复地叫着。\\n\\n “这是什么地方？”\\n\\n “在畜栏的房子里！”\\n\\n “只有我们吗？”\\n\\n “是的！”\\n\\n “可是他们要回来的！”艾尔通大声叫道。“你们快防备，快防备！”\\n\\n 然后他由于耗尽了体力，就晕过去了。\\n\\n “史佩莱，”工程师大声说，“我们随时都可能遭到进攻。把大车拉到畜栏里来。然后闩上门，大家都回到这儿来。”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫、纳布和通讯记者急忙去执行工程师的命令。现在时间一刻也不能耽误。也许这时候大车已经落在罪犯们的手里了！\\n\\n 通讯记者和他的两个伙伴很快就穿过畜栏，来到栅栏门口。这时候托普正在栅栏外阴沉沉地咆哮着。\\n\\n 工程师暂时离开艾尔通，跑到外面来，准备开枪参加战斗。赫伯特也跟着他出来。他们都注意察看俯临畜栏的支脉顶峰。如果罪犯们埋伏在那里，他们是可以把居民们一个一个都打死的。\\n\\n 这时候，月亮从东方升了起来，悬挂在森林的黑幕上空。一片银白色的月光洒在栅栏里面。畜栏里繁茂的树木、作为水源的小溪和遍地的绿茵，转眼都照亮了。靠山的一边，房屋和一部分栅栏都浸浴在皎洁的月光里。只有对门的栅栏还保持着阴暗。\\n\\n 不久以后，一团漆黑的东西出现了。那就是大车，它逐渐进入了月光照耀的范围内。当伙伴们关门和上闩的时候，赛勒斯·史密斯听见门上传来了响声。\\n\\n 这时候，托普突然挣脱了束缚，一面愤怒地狂叫，一面向畜栏的后面、也就是房子右边跑去。\\n\\n “准备开枪，朋友们！”史密斯大声说。\\n\\n 移民们端起抢来，随时准备迎击敌人。\\n\\n 托普还在不停地叫。杰普向托普追去，也尖声叫嚷起来。\\n\\n 移民们跟着杰普，来到大树覆盖下的小溪边。在明亮的月光下，他们看见了什么呢？五具尸体躺在河岸上！\\n\\n 这就是四个月以前在林肯岛上登陆的那些罪犯！\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2921.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious Island","description":"简介： The
