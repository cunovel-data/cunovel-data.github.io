{"id":5858,"no":48,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 6","content":"However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would have two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was now indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished to set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days duration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One of the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present, and a few days\u0027 rest was necessary. The departure was, therefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November. The month of November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the northern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering the tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time was, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which, if it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since Harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that the work on Prospect Heights should be finished off. Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the domesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally supplied the stables. As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than formerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough for the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House. Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager, and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all in order at the corral. During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project which would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which was already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite beneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls River. The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by means of well-cemented blocks of stone. This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the overflow of the lake formerly escaped. Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not fail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise. This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was very anxious to know if the little creek in which the \"Bonadventure\" was moored, had been visited by the convicts. \"These gentlemen,\" he observed, \"landed on the south coast, and if they followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn\u0027t give half-a-dollar for our \u0027Bonadventure.\u0027\" Pencroft\u0027s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit to Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his companions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed. Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one who approached too near him, whether \"man or beast,\" as he said. Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o\u0027clock all three left Granite House. Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had crossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should announce the colonists\u0027 return, and that at the signal Neb should return and reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river. The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the southern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles and a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to traverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest, as well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no doubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the means of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less accessible parts of the island. Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the \"Bonadventure\" was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However, Port Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely be discovered either from the land or the sea. \"Come,\" said Pencroft, \"the blackguards have not been there yet. Long grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far West.\" \"And it\u0027s very lucky, for if they had found the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027,\" added Herbert, \"they would have gone off in her, and we should have been prevented from returning to Tabor Island.\" \"Indeed,\" remarked the reporter, \"it will be important to take a document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island, and Ayrton\u0027s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch him.\" \"Well, the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 is always there, Mr. Spilett,\" answered the sailor. \"She and her crew are ready to start at a moment\u0027s notice!\" \"I think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our exploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the stranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island as about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author of the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the return of the yacht!\" \"But!\" exclaimed Pencroft, \"who in the world can he be? The fellow knows us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should he conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of honest men isn\u0027t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily? Can he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain any longer?\" Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and looked about the deck of the \"Bonadventure.\" All at once, the sailor having examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was secured,-- \"Hallo,\" he cried, \"this is queer!\" \"What is the matter, Pencroft?\" asked the reporter. \"The matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!\" And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself. \"What, it was not you?\" asked Gideon Spilett. \"No! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running bowline.\" \"You must be mistaken, Pencroft.\" \"I am not mistaken!\" declared the sailor. \"My hand does it so naturally, and one\u0027s hand is never mistaken!\" \"Then can the convicts have been on board?\" asked Herbert. \"I know nothing about that,\" answered Pencroft, \"but what is certain, is that some one has weighed the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027s\u0027 anchor and dropped it again! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat that some one has been using our vessel!\" \"But if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather gone off with her.\" \"Gone off! where to--to Tabor Island?\" replied Pencroft. \"Do you think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?\" \"We must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,\" rejoined the reporter. \"However that may be,\" said the sailor, \"as sure as my name is Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 has sailed without us!\" The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could dispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the sailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised and then dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers, unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition? \"But how was it we did not see the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 pass in the sight of the island?\" observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every possible objection. \"Why, Mr. Spilett,\" replied the sailor, \"they would only have to start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the island in two hours.\" \"Well,\" resumed Gideon Spilett, \"I ask again, what object could the convicts have had in using the \u0027Bonadventure,\u0027 and why, after they had made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?\" \"Why, Mr. Spilett,\" replied the sailor, \"we must put that among the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief thing is that the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 was there, and she is there now. Only, unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very likely not find her again in her place!\" \"Then, Pencroft,\" said Herbert, \"would it not be wisest to bring the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 off to Granite House?\" \"Yes and no,\" answered Pencroft, \"or rather no. The mouth of the Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.\" \"But by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?\" \"Perhaps yes,\" replied Pencroft. \"At any rate, since we must leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 will be safer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here until the island is rid of these blackguards.\" \"That is exactly my opinion,\" said the reporter. \"At any rate in the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at the mouth of the Mercy.\" \"But suppose the convicts pay her another visit,\" said Herbert. \"Well, my boy,\" replied Pencroft, \"not finding her here, they would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore, with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our return we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant visits.\" \"That\u0027s settled. Let us be off,\" said the reporter. Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House, told the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their arrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the \"Bonadventure\" would be always within reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key. That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish the engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided that on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th, he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented himself. But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was, therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate reply. The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute. The colonists\u0027 uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control over his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night? They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain. \"But,\" said Herbert, \"perhaps some accident has happened to the telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?\" \"That may be,\" said the reporter. \"Wait till to-morrow,\" replied Cyrus Harding. \"It is possible, indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not received his.\" They waited, of course not without some anxiety. At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric current along the wire and received no reply. He tried again: the same result. \"Off to the corral,\" said he. \"And well armed!\" added Pencroft. It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone and that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends to Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he watched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton. In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to force the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them, and as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where, the lift once raised, he would be in safety. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair to the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring woods. At six o\u0027clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions had passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound crowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream. The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights, immediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns, ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and the two guns had been loaded with ball. The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really formidable. The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them, sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger. Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which connected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty. The posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped, exclaiming,-- \"The wire is broken!\" His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident that the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite House. \"It wasn\u0027t the wind that blew down this post,\" observed Pencroft. \"No,\" replied Gideon Spilett. \"The earth has been dug up round its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man.\" \"Besides, the wire is broken,\" added Herbert, showing that the wire had been snapped. \"Is the fracture recent?\" asked Harding. \"Yes,\" answered Herbert, \"it has certainly been done quite lately.\" \"To the corral! to the corral!\" exclaimed the sailor. The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral, having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with redoubled speed. Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in the corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting this communication? The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were sincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader? Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows of the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their guns were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every side. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous. At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage could be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the corral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton\u0027s voice could be heard. \"Let us enter,\" said Cyrus Harding. And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment\u0027s notice. Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it back, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a cry of pain. Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground. 移民们的头一件大事是彻底搜索全岛，这一点已经决定了。搜索的目的有两个：一方面要找出那个神秘的人，因为现在已经可以肯定岛上有这样一个人；另一方面，还要了解海盗的情况，他们藏在哪里，目前在过着什么样的生活，他们有哪些可怕的地方。赛勒斯·史密斯本打算毫不耽搁，立刻就出发，可是探险需要用几天的工夫，最好还是把各种必需品和工具装在车上，以便组织露宿。偏巧有一只野驴伤了腿，暂时不能拉车，必须让它休息几天。因此，只好把动身的日子订在11月20日，往后推迟一星期。这个地方的十一月相当于北半球的五月，因此正是大好风光。太阳进入了南回归线，目前是一年里白天最长的时候。所以，要去探险，现在是最适合的时候，即使探险的主要目的不能达到，至少也可以有得多的发现，特别是自然物产方面的发现；因为史密斯建议要探索的是一直绵延到盘蛇半岛尽头的远西森林。 大家一致同意，利用出发前的九天，做完眺望岗上的工作。 此外，还需要艾尔通回畜栏去照料家畜。大家决定让他在那里住两天，等把厩房里的饲料准备充足以后，再回“花岗石宫”来。 艾尔通临动身的时候，史密斯考虑到岛上不象过去那样安全了，就问他要不要有一个人陪他一起去。艾尔通回说不必，因为工作一个人满可以照顾得过来，至于有什么危险，他是不怕的。如果畜栏或是附近发生什么事情，他可以立刻打电报告诉“花岗石宫”里的居民。 9日清晨，天一亮艾尔通就出发；他驾着一只野驴，拉着大车走了。两个钟头以后，来了一个电报，告诉大家畜栏里平安无事。 在这两天中，史密斯忙着办一件事，这件事办好以后，“花岗石宫”就不怕任何突如其来的袭击了。格兰特湖南端原有的缺口早已堵死了，而且已经被长出的草木遮住了一部分，现在必须把它完全挡起来。进行这项工作，再容易也没有了，只要使湖水升高两三英尺，就可以把洞口完全淹没。要提高湖面，只要在湖的两个缺口处各建一个水闸，因为湖水就是通过这两个缺口流入甘油河与瀑布河的。 移民们满怀信心地工作着，这两个水闸宽不过八英尺，高不过三英尺，他们把石块严密地垒起来，不久就把水闸砌成了。 这项工程完毕以后，外人做梦也想不到这部分湖底下有一条通道，想不到过去湖水就是从这里流出去的。 当然，供应“花岗石宫”蓄水池用水和带动升降梯的小河还小心地保留着，而且，保证不会断水。这样，只要把升降梯吊起来，这个可靠的安乐窝就万无一失了。 这项工程完成得很快，潘克洛夫、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特还可以抽出时间到气球港去一次。水手非常着急，他总担心罪犯们已经到停泊乘风破浪号的小海湾那里去过了。 “这些先生们是在南岸登陆的，”他说，“要是他们沿着海滨前进，也许会发现小港。那时候，我们的乘风破浪号就等于白扔了。” 潘克洛夫的顾虑并不是毫无根据的。看起来，气球港的确需要去看一下。11月10日，吃完午饭以后，水手和他的伙伴们带着武器出发了。潘克洛夫故意当着大家的面，把两颗子弹分别装进他的步枪的两个枪筒里，一面摇摇头，他那副样子好象在说，不管是谁——正如他自己所说的，“人也好，畜生也好，”——只要走到他面前，就都要倒楣了。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特也拿着枪，大约三点钟的时候，三个人离开了“花岗石宫”。 纳布把他们送到慈悲河拐角的地方，等他们过了河以后，就把桥扯起来了。他们约定在回来的时候，放枪为号，纳布听见枪声，就来恢复两岸之间的交通。 他们沿着通向荒岛南岸的道路，一直往前走去，这一段距离只有三英里半，可是吉丁·史佩莱和他的伙伴却走了两个钟头。他们仔细地观察了沿路各处，浓密的森林，潦凫沼地，然而并没有发现亡命之徒的踪迹；毫无疑问，罪犯们还不知道移民的人数和已经采取的防御手段，因此只占了荒岛一小部分。 到了气球港，只见乘风破浪号静静地浮在小海湾上，潘克洛夫非常高兴。气球港周围有高耸的峭壁遮挡着，地势险峻，不管是在陆地上还是在海里，都很不容易发现它。 “快来吧，”潘克洛夫说，“那些坏蛋还没有到这儿来过。俗语说得好：‘深山有虎豹’，他们一定藏到远西森林里去了。” “还好，”赫伯特说，“要是他们找到乘风破浪号，他们一定会乘着它逃跑的——那么一来，我们就不能再到达抱岛去了。” “真的，”通讯记者说，“我们应该送一张纸条到那里去。要是苏格兰游船来接艾尔通回去的话，就能知道林肯岛的位置和艾尔通的新住址了。” “嗯，乘风破浪号随时都在这儿准备着，史佩莱先生，”水手说。“我们马上乘着它动身都可以！” “我想，潘克洛夫，那要等我们在荒岛上探索完毕以后再去。如果我们能找到那个陌生人就好了，也许他了解达抱岛和了解林肯岛一样清楚。不要忘记，那张纸条一定是他写的；也许，连究竟能不能指望游船回来，他都知道！” “可是，”潘克洛夫大声说，“他究竟是谁啊？他这样了解我们，而我们却一点也不了解他！如果他只不过是个遇难的人，那么他为什么要隐藏着不出来呢？我们是老实人，我想老实人总不会被人讨厌的。他是自己要到这儿来的吗？如果他想离开这儿，他能离开吗？他还在这儿吗？他还要继续呆下去吗？” 潘克洛夫、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特一面闲谈，一面走上乘风破浪号去察看船上的甲板。水手看了一下系锚缆的短桩，突然叫道： “嘿，真奇怪！” “怎么回事，潘克洛夫？”通讯记者问道。 “是这么回事，这个扣不是我系的！” 潘克洛夫指着一根把锚缆系在短桩上的绳子。 “什么，不是你系的？”吉丁·史佩菜问道。 “不是！我可以发誓，这是一个拱结，我总是打活扣的。” “你一定记错了，潘克洛夫。” “我决没有记错！”水手声明说。“我的手系起扣来成了习惯了，一个人的手总不会错的！” “那么，是不是罪犯们到船上来过了呢？”赫伯特问道。 “那我就不知道了，”潘克洛夫说，“反正有人拔过乘风破浪号的锚，然后又让它抛锚，这是可以肯定的！瞧，这儿又是一个证据！锚缆被抽了出来，卷索不在锚缆孔里了。我再重复一遍，有人用过我们的船了！” “可是，如果罪犯们发现了它，他们一定会把它抢去使用，甚至还会乘着它逃跑的。” “逃跑！跑到哪儿去……到达抱岛去吗？”潘克洛夫问道。“这只船这么小，你想他们敢乘着它去冒险吗？” “再说，他们还不一定知道有那个小岛呢。”通讯记者接着说。 “不管怎么样，”水手说，“就好象我生在葡萄园、名叫潘克洛夫一样的没有错，我们的乘风破浪号已经偷偷地出去航行过了！” 水手非常肯定，吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特都感到没法辨驳。自从潘克洛夫把这只船带到气球港来以后，显然有人或多或少移动过它了。水手更是百分之百地认为曾经有人拔过锚，然后又把锚抛下去。这样往返两道手续，除非是为了用它航行，此外还能有什么别的企图呢？ “可是我们在岛上怎么没有看见乘风破浪号在海里走过呢？”通讯记者说，他急于把所有的反对意见一下子都提出来。 “怎么，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“只要在夜里遇着顺风，两个钟头以内，它就可以走到海岛的视线以外去了。” “好吧，”吉丁·史佩莱接着问道，“我还要问一个问题，罪犯们驾驶乘风破浪号去做什么，而且用过以后，为什么又要把它送回港口来？” “嗯，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“这点我们不必多费脑筋，只好把它列入那些不可思议的事情里去。主要的问题是乘风破浪号还在这儿，而且现在就在这儿。要是不幸让罪犯们第二次把它劫走，恐怕我们就不用打算再在这里找到它了！” “那么，潘克洛夫，”赫伯特说，“我们把乘风破浪号带回去，让它停在‘花岗石宫’附近不好吗？” “也好也不好，”潘克洛夫答道，“还是不好的成分居多。慈悲河口一点不适合停船，那里的潮势太猛。” “可是能不能把它停在‘石窟’底下的沙滩上呢？” “也许可以，”潘克洛夫回答说。“不管怎么样，既然我们一定要离开‘花岗石宫’作一次远征，我想，当我们不在的时候，还是把乘风破浪号留在这儿比较安全些，在岛上的匪徒没有肃清以前，我们最好还是把它放在这里。” “我完全同意，”通讯记者说。“如果遇到变天，这里至少不会象在慈悲河口那样，暴露在外面。” “可是如果罪犯们再上这儿来呢？”赫伯特说。 “孩子，”潘克洛夫回答说，“他们即使在这里找不到它，也会很快就在‘花岗石宫’的沙滩上找到它的！反正当我们不在的时候，没有任何办法能拦阻他们把船抢走！因此，我同意史佩莱先生的意见，还是把它留在气球港。不过，如果等我们回来以后，还不能肃清这帮流氓的话，那时候我们就要谨慎些，把船放到‘花岗石宫’附近去，等到不怕再有什么讨厌的骚扰的时候，再另作打算。” “对，就这样决定了。我们走吧！”通讯记者说。 潘克洛夫、赫伯特和吉丁·史佩莱回到“花岗石宫”以后，把全部经过都告诉了工程师，工程师对他们目前的办法和将来的打算，都表示同意。他还答应水手，要勘探一下小岛和海岸之间的海峡，看看能不能利用水闸，在那里开辟一个人工的港口。要是能够办到，那么，乘风破浪号就将永远摆在移民们的眼前，随时可以照管它了；甚至在必要的时候，还可以把它锁起来。 当天晚上，他们打了一个电报给艾尔通，要求他从畜栏带两只山羊来，因为纳布想使它们适应高地的水土。奇怪的是，这次与平时不同，在电报发出后，艾尔通并没有回电。工程师不禁诧异起来。但是也可能当时艾尔通不在畜栏里，甚至他已经动身回“花岗石宫”了。事实上他到畜栏去已经有两天，临行预先约定在10日晚上，至迟在11日早上回来。于是移民们在眺望岗上等待着艾尔通。纳布和赫伯特甚至一直迎到桥边，打算一看见他们的伙伴，就放下吊桥。 可是直到晚上十点钟，还是没有艾尔通的信号。于是，大家主张最好再打一个电报，要求对方立刻回答。 然而，“花岗石宫”的电报铃还是没有响声。 居民们非常不安。出了什么事了？是艾尔通已经不在畜栏里，还是他依然在那里，但是不能自由行动了呢？他们可以在这茫茫的黑夜里到畜栏去吗？ 大家商量了一下。有的主张去，有的主张不去。 “可是，”赫伯特说，“也许是电报发生了故障，通报不灵了吧？” “那也可能。”通讯记者说。 “等到明天吧，”赛勒斯·史密斯说。“的确，艾尔通可能收不到我们的电报，我们也可能收不到他的。” 他们等待着，自然，他们的心情是非常焦急的。 第二天，11月11日，大亮的时候，史密斯又打了一次电报，还是没有回音。 他接着又试了一次，结果还是一样。 “到畜栏去！”他说。 “全副武装！”潘克洛夫补充道。 大家马上想到，“花岗石宫”里不能不留人，决定让纳布看家。纳布把伙伴们送到甘油河畔，把吊桥扯起来，然后躲在一棵树后面，等待他们或是艾尔通回来。 要是海盗们突然出现，要夺路过来，纳布可以开枪阻止他们，万一阻挡不住，最后还能躲到“花岗石宫”去，只要把升降梯一吊起来，他就可以安如磐石了。 赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特和潘克洛夫四个人到畜栏去，如果找不到艾尔通，他们就到附近的森林里去搜索。 早上六点钟，工程师和他的三个伙伴跨过甘油河，纳布藏在左岸的一个顶上长满龙血树的小丘后面。 居民们离开眺望岗的高地，径直走上畜栏路。他们扛着枪，哪怕遇到最小的敌对行动，都随时准备开枪。两支步枪和两支滑膛枪都已装满了子弹。 路的两旁都是密林，罪犯们到处都可以藏身，加上他们还有武器，敌人的确是可怕的。 移民们走得很快，一路上一句话也没有说。托普在前面引着路，有时候一路奔跑，有时候钻到森林里去，可是始终保持安静，好象没有遇到什么意外。他们相信这只忠实的狗是不会使他们突然受到惊吓的，只要稍微有一些危险，它就会大叫起来。 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们继续前进，路旁就是从“花岗石宫”通往畜栏的电报线。走了将近两英里，他们还没有发现任何可以解释疑问的地方。电报杆好好的竖在地上，电线也照常拉着。可是，这时候工程师发现电线好象松了，一路领先的赫伯特走到第七十四号电线杆的时候，突然停下来喊道： “电线断了！” 伙伴们连忙赶上前去，来到少年站脚的地方。只见电线杆横倒在路上，连根拔起来了。疑问突然得到了解答，显然，“花岗石宫”和畜栏两处打出的电报都没有收到。 “这根电线杆不象是被风刮倒的。”潘克洛夫说。 “不错，”吉丁·史佩莱说。“齐根的土都被挖起来了，这是人们用手拔起来的。” “还有，电线也断了。”赫伯特指着断线补充道。 “是最近破坏的吗？”史密斯问道。 “是的，”赫伯特回答说，“肯定是不久以前才破坏的。” “到畜栏去！到畜栏去！”水手大叫道。 居民们现在所在的地方正是“花岗石宫”和畜栏的中间，还要走二英里半。他们加快了速度，急急在前赶去。 的确，可能畜栏里出了什么事了。固然艾尔通打出的电报可能没有收到，但是他的伙伴们考虑的却不是这个。更使人难以理解的是：艾尔通答应在前一天晚上回来，结果却没有回来。一句话，切断“花岗石宫”和畜栏之间的联系不会是没有用意的，而这个破坏联系的人除了那些罪犯以外，还有谁呢？ 居民们急急忙忙地向前赶去，每个人心里都感到十分焦急。他们衷心地喜爱这位新来的伙伴。他们会不会发现他被从前的党羽亲手杀害了呢？ 他们不久就来到一处地方，这里路旁有一条小河，河水是从红河里流出来的，它成了畜栏牧场的水源。这时他们脚步慢下来了，为的是免得在必须战斗的时候，喘不过气来。他们的手指都扣着枪的板机。大家注视着四面的森林。托普阴沉沉地咆哮着，似乎预告有什么不幸的事情要发生了。 终于，从树木中间露出了畜栏的栅栏。看不见有什么破坏的痕迹。大门还是照常关着。畜栏里静悄悄的，既听不见平日咩咩的羊叫，也听不见艾尔通的吆喝声。 “我们进去吧。”赛勒斯·史密斯说。 工程师住前走去，他的伙伴们在二十步以外跟着他，仔细警戒着，随时准备开枪。 史密斯拔开门上的内闩，正打算推进去，这时候，托普忽然大叫起来。只听见“砰！”的一声，紧接着就是一声惨叫。 一颗子弹打中了赫伯特，他立刻直挺挺地倒在地上。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2915.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious Island","description":"简介： The Mysterious Island is a
