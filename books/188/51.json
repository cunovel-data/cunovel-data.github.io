{"id":5861,"no":51,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 9","content":"The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One thing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be brought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some shot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that impregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited impatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.\n They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.\n They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton\u0027s disappearance they were only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause.\n The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them.\n \"My friends,\" said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the impossibility of communicating with him, \"I think,--like you, that to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot without being able to return it. But do you not think that the best thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?\"\n \"That is just what I was thinking,\" answered Pencroft. \"I believe we\u0027re not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding approves, I\u0027m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is equal to another!\"\n \"But is he equal to five?\" asked the engineer.\n \"I will join Pencroft,\" said the reporter, \"and both of us, well-armed and accompanied by Top--\"\n \"My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,\" answered Harding, \"let us reason coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they are sure to fire the first shot?\"\n \"Well, captain,\" cried Pencroft, \"a bullet does not always reach its mark.\"\n \"That which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer. \"Besides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should remain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?\"\n \"You are right, captain,\" replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with sullen anger. \"You are right; they will do all they can to retake the corral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold it against them.\"\n \"Oh, if we were only at Granite House!\"\n \"If we were at Granite House,\" answered the engineer, \"the case would be very different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one, while the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we are at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it together.\"\n Cyrus Harding\u0027s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions understood it well.\n \"If only Ayrton was still one of us!\" said Gideon Spilett. \"Poor fellow! his return to social life will have been but of short duration.\"\n \"If he is dead,\" added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.\n \"Do you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?\" asked Gideon Spilett.\n \"Yes, if they had any interest in doing so.\"\n \"What! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting all that he owes us--\"\n \"Who knows?\" answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful supposition without hesitating.\n \"Pencroft,\" said Harding, taking the sailor\u0027s arm, \"that is a wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking thus. I will answer for Ayrton\u0027s fidelity.\"\n \"And I also,\" added the reporter quickly.\n \"Yes, yes, captain, I was wrong,\" replied Pencroft; \"it was a wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I\u0027m not in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly, and I have never felt so excited as I do now.\n \"Be patient, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer. \"How long will it be, my dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?\"\n \"That is difficult to say, Cyrus,\" answered the reporter, \"for any imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from now-- well, we shall see.\"\n Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the first days of December. At this time two months of spring had already passed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural labors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.\n It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral must have been to the colonists.\n But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so without impatience.\n Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the tour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for any emergency.\n He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.\n However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett, who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south of the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious object to him.\n Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice, while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the presence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor approaching.\n Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush, and drew out a rag.\n It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately brought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists, who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton\u0027s waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.\n \"You see, Pencroft,\" observed Harding, \"there has been resistance on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in spite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?\"\n \"No, captain,\" answered the sailor, \"and I repented of my suspicion a long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the incident.\"\n \"What is that?\" asked the reporter.\n \"It is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still living!\"\n \"Perhaps, indeed,\" replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.\n This was a hope, to which Ayrton\u0027s companions could still hold. Indeed, they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not killed him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of the island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows but that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton to themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been able to make him turn traitor!\n This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and it no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again. On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!\n \"At any rate,\" observed Gideon Spilett, \"if happily Ayrton did manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and consequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.\"\n \"Oh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!\" cried Pencroft, \"and that we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!\"\n Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops. But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers was needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral! Therefore, one idea occupied his mind--to leave the corral, and when! He believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his strength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight of the sea!\n Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with good reason, that Herbert\u0027s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way, did not give the order to start.\n However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his two friends to yield to the lad\u0027s wish, and God alone knew that this determination might cause them grief and remorse.\n It was the 29th of November, seven o\u0027clock in the evening. The three settlers were talking in Herbert\u0027s room, when they heard Top utter quick barks.\n Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it was with pleasure, not anger.\n \"Some one is coming.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"It is not an enemy!\"\n \"Neb, perhaps?\"\n \"Or Ayrton?\"\n These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground inside the corral.\n It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most cordial reception.\n \"Jup!\" exclaimed Pencroft.\n \"Neb has sent him to us,\" said the reporter.\n \"Then,\" replied the engineer, \"he must have some note on him.\"\n Pencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could, nor even Top himself.\n Cyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup\u0027s neck hung a small bag, and in this bag was found a little note traced by Neb\u0027s hand.\n The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read these words:--\n \"Friday, six o\u0027clock in the morning.\n \"Plateau invaded by convicts.\n \"Neb.\"\n They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered the house. what were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that was disaster, devastation, ruin.\n Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter, guessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no longer doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.\n \"Captain Harding,\" said he, \"I must go; I can bear the journey. I must go.\"\n Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,--\n \"Let us go, then!\" said he.\n The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion of the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would they not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free? Was it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in it, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could be done.\n The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and the reporter raised Herbert\u0027s mattress and placed it on the bottom of the cart. The weather was fine. The sun\u0027s bright rays glanced through the trees.\n \"Are the guns ready?\" asked Cyrus Harding.\n They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.\n \"Are you comfortable, Herbert?\" asked the engineer.\n \"Ah, captain,\" replied the lad, \"don\u0027t be uneasy, I shall not die on the road!\"\n While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his failing strength.\n The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to give the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to despair--killed him perhaps.\n \"Forward!\" said Harding.\n The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.\n Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than that which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart would have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was necessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to the convicts.\n Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart, ready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.\n Neb\u0027s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts had shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o\u0027clock in the morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be safe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House. However, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter armed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides of the road, signalized no danger.\n The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft\u0027s guidance. It had left the corral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles had been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was as deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the Mercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on the island.\n They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge over Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place; supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after having passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they would have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a retreat.\n At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen. But the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders thought of abandoning it.\n At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,--\n \"Oh! the villains!\" he exclaimed.\n And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the buildings at the poultry-yard.\n A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.\n His companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.\n The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having devastated it!\n \"And Mr. Herbert?\" asked Neb.\n Gideon Spilett returned to the cart.\n Herbert had lost consciousness!\n 少年的病况正常地好转了。现在只等一件事，就是等他病势好转到一定的程度，就把他抬回“花岗石宫”去。不管畜栏盖得多么好，里面什么都不缺，但是总不比“花岗石宫”那样舒服，那样适合健康。并且，畜栏里也不如那里安全，虽然居民们非常小心，他们还是怕罪犯们暗地里向他们开枪。在“花岗石宫”里就不同了，它在坚固而高耸的峭壁中间，在里面用不着顾虑什么，任何进攻的企图都注定会失败的。于是他们焦急地等待着，一旦等到赫伯特不致因移动而给创口带来危险的时候，他们就要动身了。要想通过啄木鸟林虽然有很大的困难，他们还是下定决心要搬回去。\n 他们得不到纳布的消息，但是他们并没有为这件事而担心。勇敢的黑人坚守在“花岗石宫”里，是不会受到袭击的。他们没有再派托普到他那里去，因为把这只忠实的狗送给敌人射击，只能使居民们丧失一个最得力的助手，决不会有任何好处。\n 因此，虽然他们急着要到“花岗石宫”里去聚会，但还是等待着。工程师看到自己的兵力分散，使海盗们有机可乘，感到非常苦恼。自从艾尔通失踪以后，只剩下他们四个人在对抗五个匪徒，赫伯特现在当然不能计算在内；这一点，勇敢的少年非常关心，他十分明白自己给大家造成的困难。\n 11月26日，当赫伯特睡着了听不见的时候，赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫详细地讨论了在他们所处的环境里，应该怎样对付海盗的问题。\n “朋友们，”他们谈过纳布以及不能和他联系的问题以后，通讯记者说，“我的想法和你们一样，如果从畜栏路上冒险走回去，那末，只能挨打，不能还手。依我看，我们倒不如大张旗鼓地去追赶这帮匪徒。”\n “我完全同意，”潘克洛夫说。“我敢说我们都不是怕吃子弹的人；拿我来说吧，只要史密斯先生答应，我随时都可以冲进森林去！真是岂有此理！只要是人，不是一个抵一个吗？”\n “可是抵得了五个吗？”工程师问道。\n “我和潘克洛夫一起去，”通讯记者说，“我们两个人全副武装，带着托普……”\n “亲爱的史佩莱，还有你，潘克洛夫，”史密斯说，“我们冷静地考虑一下吧。要是罪犯们躲在荒岛上一个什么地方，如果我们探清了那个地方，只等把他们赶出来，我是会直接向他们发动进攻的；可是事实恰好相反，他们肯定会先开枪打我们，这是一点儿也不用怀疑的。”\n “可是，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫叫道，“子弹不一定就能够打中的。”\n “赫伯特却被打中了，潘克洛夫，”工程师说。“并且，你再想想，你们两个人离开了畜栏，这里就只剩下我一个人防守了。你想，你们走的时候，罪犯们会看不见吗？他们明知道这里没有别人，只有一个受了伤的孩子和我，难道不会放你们到森林里去，乘你们不在的时候，向这里进攻吗？”\n “你说得对，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫憋着一肚子气回答说。“你说得对，他们知道畜栏里什么都有，他们会尽一切力量来重新霸占畜栏的；你一个人当然挡不住他们。”\n “唉，要是我们在‘花岗石宫’里就好了！”\n “要是我们在‘花岗石宫’里，”工程师说，“情况就完全不同了。在那里把赫伯特留给一个人照顾，让其余的三个人到森林里去搜索，那我完全用不着担心。可是现在我们是在畜栏里，最好还是等到大家能一起走的时候再离开这里。”\n 赛勒斯·史密斯的论点是无可辩驳的，他的伙伴们非常明白这一点。\n “要是艾尔通还活着就好了！”吉丁·史佩莱说。“可怜的人！他回到集体中间来仅仅是那么短短的一段时期。”\n “这是不是说他已死了。”潘克洛夫用一种奇怪的嗓音补充了一句。\n “那么，潘克洛夫，你认为匪徒们没有把他杀死吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。\n “是的，如果对他们有利，他们不会杀死他的。”\n “什么？你认为艾尔通一看见他过去的党羽，就会忘记我们对他的好处……”\n “那谁知道呢？”他也觉得这种可耻的想法有些说不出口，因此说的时候吞吞吐吐。\n “潘克洛夫，”史密斯抓住水手的胳膊说，“这是一个很坏的想法，如果你坚持要这样说，你会使我非常痛心的。我敢担保艾尔通是忠实可靠的。”\n “我也敢保证。”通讯记者也急忙补充道。\n “是的，是的，史密斯先生，我错了，”潘克洛夫说，“我的想法的确太坏了，这样想是没有丝毫根据的。可是我有什么办法呢？我已经晕头转向了。成天关在畜栏里使我烦得要命，我从来没有象现在这样不安心。”\n “耐心点，潘克洛夫，”工程师说。“亲爱的史佩莱，你认为要再过多久才能把赫伯特抬到‘花岗石宫’去呢？”\n “那很难说，赛勒斯，”通讯记者答道，“只要有一点不小心，就可能引起严重后果。可是他现在一天比一天好转，如果继续增加体力，那么从现在起，八天以后——嗯，我们再等等看吧。”\n 八天！这就是说，要延迟到十二月初才能回“花岗石宫”。现在春天已经过去两个月了。气候很好，也开始热起来了。荒岛上森林的枝叶已经长得非常茂盛，按季节说，收割的时候也快到了。因此，回到眺望岗的高地以后，除了按照计划彻底探索荒岛以外，接着就要下地干重活了。\n 从这一点可以看出，移民们这样困守在畜栏里，所受的损失是非常严重的。\n 他们在这种环境下作了不得已的让步，然而他们内心里是十分焦急的。\n 有一两次，通讯记者冒险到栏外的路上去，在栅栏周围巡视。托普陪着他，吉丁·史佩莱扣着板机，随时准备迎接任何危险。\n 他没有遇到什么灾难，也没有发现任何可疑的踪迹。只要有一点危险，托普就会警告他的；既然它没有叫，可以这样说，至少当时没有什么可顾虑的，罪犯们大概在荒岛的其他地方干什么勾当去了。\n 11月27日那天，吉丁·史佩莱进行了第二次侦察，他往山的南部，冒险向森林里深入了四分之一英里。这一次他感觉出托普似乎闻到了什么。它不象过去那样漫不经心了。它来回乱跑，在野草和灌木中间搜索，好象闻到什么可疑的东西似的。\n 吉丁·史佩莱跟着托普，他一面鼓励它，唤起它的注意，一面留神监视，他躲在树的后边，随时准备开枪。托普所闻到的，也许不是人；因为根据过去的习惯，如果是人，它总是阴沉沉地低声怒吼。现在它并没有怒吼，可见附近并没有危险，也没有危险即将到来的迹象。\n 过了将近五分钟，托普还在搜索，通讯记者小心翼翼地跟着它。突然，托普向一棵枝叶茂密的灌木冲去，一会儿衔出一块破布来。\n 这是一块肮脏的破布，史佩莱立刻把它带回畜栏。移民们仔细看了一下，发现这是从艾尔通背心上撕下来的一块毡子，正是独一无二的“花岗石宫”工场里的产品。\n “你看，潘克洛夫，”史密斯说，“不幸的艾尔通曾经反抗过。罪犯们硬把他架走了！你还怀疑他不忠实吗？”\n “不怀疑了，史密斯先生，”水手回答说，“我早就后悔不该这样怀疑了！可是我认为通过这件事情，可以得出一个结论来。”\n “什么结论？”通讯记者问道。\n “艾尔通不是在畜栏里被杀的！他既然挣扎过，那么被架走的时候，他一定还没有死。因此，也许他还活着呢！”\n “的确，这是可能的。”工程师答道，他还在沉思。\n 艾尔通的伙伴们现在可以抱着这样一个希望了。在这以前他们是这样想的，艾尔通在畜栏里遇到了袭击，象赫伯特似的，被一枪打倒了。如果在一开始的时候罪犯们没有打死他，如果他们把他活着架到荒岛的其他地方去，能不能认为他目前还在作他们的俘虏呢？也许罪犯们中间有人认出了艾尔通是昔日的逃犯首领，化名为彭·觉斯的澳洲伙伴。谁知道他们会不会妄想使艾尔通重新入伙呢？如果他们能使艾尔通变成叛徒，对他们说来，用处是很大的！\n 经过大家的分析，畜栏里的人一致认为这件事对自己有利，他们不再认为不可能重新找到艾尔通了。在艾尔通这方面来说，只要他还是个俘虏，他一定会想尽办法从匪徒们的魔掌里逃出来的，这对居民们说来，将是一个非常有力的帮助！\n “不管怎么样！”吉丁·史佩莱说，“如果艾尔通真能侥幸地逃出来，他一定会直接到‘花岗石宫’去的，因为他还不知道匪徒们这次的暗杀阴谋，以及赫伯特作了阴谋的牺牲品，所以他绝想不到我们会困守在畜栏里！”\n “啊！但愿他在那儿，在‘花岗石宫’里！”潘克洛夫叫道，“但愿我们也在那儿！要不然这些流氓虽然没法破坏我们的房子，他们却可能去洗劫我们的高地、农场和家禽场！”\n 潘克洛夫已经变成一个十足的庄稼汉了，他从心里挂虑他的庄稼。但是必须说明，最急于想回“花岗石宫”的却是赫伯特，他知道目前居民们最好是回到那里去。但是大家却因为他而固守在畜栏里！因此，他脑子里只有一个念头——离开畜栏，什么时候能够离开？他相信他已经可以经得起迁移的劳累了。他深信在自己那间面临大海、有海风调节空气的房间里，他的体力一定可以恢复得更快的！\n 他几次催促吉丁·史佩莱，可是史佩莱始终没有下令动身，他的理由很正确，创伤还没有完全收回，怕在路上重新迸裂开来。\n 可是，不久发生了一件事，使赛勒斯·史密斯和他的两个伙伴不得不答应少年的要求。天晓得，这个决定竟会给他们带来悲痛和悔恨。\n 11月29日晚上七点钟，三个居民正在赫伯特的房里谈话，突然听到托普急促的吠叫声。\n 史密斯、潘克洛夫和史佩莱抓起枪就往外面跑。托普在栅栏底下一面叫，一面跳，但是它好象很高兴，而不是发怒。\n “有人来了。”\n “是的。”\n “不是敌人！”\n “会不会是纳布？”\n “也许是艾尔通？”\n 工程师和他的两个伙伴话还没有说完，就有一个东西翻过栅栏，跳进畜栏来了。\n 原来是杰普，是小杰普亲自来了。托普立刻向它表示热烈的欢迎。\n “杰普！”潘克洛夫叫道。\n “准是纳布派它到我们这儿来的。”通讯记者说。\n “那么，”工程师说，“它身上一定有信。”\n 潘克洛夫急忙跑到猩猩身边去。肯定地说，如果纳布有什么重要的消息要传达给他的主人，他再也找不到比杰普更可靠更迅速的通讯员了；不仅移民们没法通过的地方它能走，甚至连托普走不过去的地方，它都能过去。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯没有猜错。杰普的脖子底下挂着一个小口袋，口袋里有—张纳布亲笔写的纸条。\n 当史密斯和他的伙伴们看到下面这些话的时候，他们的懊恼是可以想象的。\n 星期五早上六点钟。\n 高地遭到罪犯的侵袭。\n 纳布\n 大家你看着我，我看着你，一句话也没有说，然后回到屋子里去了。他们该怎么办呢？罪犯们在眺望岗上！那就意昧着灾难、抢劫和破坏。\n 赫伯特看见工程师、通讯记者和潘克洛夫进来，就已经猜到他们的处境大概又变坏了，等到看见杰普，他毫不怀疑，“花岗石宫”准是遭到了不幸的威胁。\n “史密斯先生，”他说，“我一定要走；我经得起路上的劳累。我一定要走。”\n 吉丁·史佩莱走到赫伯特的身旁，看了他一会儿，然后说：\n “那么，我们走吧！”\n 究竟用担架抬赫伯特，还是用艾尔通驾来的大车呢？这个问题很快就决定了。用担架抬对受伤的少年比较适合一些，但是它需要两个人抬，也就是说，如果在路上遇到攻击，要自卫就少了两支枪。相反地，如果利用大车，不就能把所有的人手都腾出来了吗？至于怕沿路颠簸，他们如果把赫伯特现在所铺的垫子放在车上，尽量小心地前进，不就可以避免了吗？这是可以办到的。\n 大车拉过来了。潘克洛夫套上野驴。赛勒斯·史密斯和通讯记者把赫伯特连垫子一起抬起来，放在大车里边。天气很好。明媚的阳光穿过树木，照耀着。\n “枪都准备好了吗？”赛勒斯·史密斯问道。\n 一切都准备妥当了。工程师和潘克洛夫每人拿了一支双筒枪，吉丁·史佩莱带着他的步枪，现在只等出发了。\n “你不觉得难受吗，赫伯特？”工程师问道。\n “史密斯先生，”少年回答说，“你放心，我不会死在路上的！”\n 说话的时候，可以看得出来，可怜的少年鼓起了他的全身精力，在坚强的意志下，他振作起微弱的力量来。\n 工程师心里感到一阵难受，他还有些犹豫，不想下出发命令；可是那会使赫伯特失望的——也许会使他灰心郁闷而死。\n “走吧！”史密斯说。\n 畜栏的门开了。杰普和托普知道什么时候应该保持安静，它们在前面引着路。大车出来以后，门又关上了。潘克洛夫牵着野驴，慢慢地向前走去。\n 如果不走畜栏路，另外选一条小道，肯定要比较安全些；可是，那就要从树底下穿过去，大车走起来很不方便。因此，虽然罪犯们非常熟悉这条道路，但他们还是非从这里走不可。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和吉丁·史佩莱一边一个，跟着大车前进，随时准备迎敌。其实，这时候罪犯们多半还没有离开眺望岗的高地呢？\n 纳布显然是在发现罪犯以后，立刻就把信写好发出去的。信上所写的时间是早上六点钟。机灵的猩猩来惯了畜栏，几乎用不了三刻钟，就可以从五英里以外的“花岗石宫”来到这里了。因此，在这路上的时候他们是不会遇到什么危险的。如果要开枪格斗，大概也得等到离“花岗石宫”不远才有可能。然而移民们还是小心地戒备着。杰普拿着棍子，和托普两个有时在前走，有时在路旁的森林里探索，都没有表示遇到什么危险。\n 潘克洛夫作向导，领着大车慢慢地前进。离开畜栏的时候，是早上七点半。走了一个钟头，五英里的路程已经走了四英里，还没有发生什么事情。沿路的情况和慈悲河到格兰特湖之间整个的啄木鸟林一样，都是静悄悄的，没有一点儿动静。现在没有什么需要发警报的。森林里和居民们第一天着陆的时候一样，没有丝毫人迹。\n 快到高地了。再过一英里，就可以看见甘油河上的吊桥。赛勒斯·史密斯猜想吊桥一定还好好地架在河上；他认为如果罪犯们已经跨过桥梁，渡过环绕高地周围的小河，为了小心起见，他们一定会把吊桥放下来，作为后退的余地的。\n 终于，透过树木之间的一个空隙，可以看见海平线了。大车还在继续前进，护送的人谁也不想把它扔下来。\n 这时候，潘克洛夫突然勒住野驴的缰绳，用沙哑的嗓音大叫道：\n “啊！这些强盗！”\n 他指着前面，只见一股浓烟从磨坊、棚屋和家禽场的房舍那里升向天空。\n 在浓烟里，有一个人在行动。那是纳布。\n 伙伴们喊了一声。纳布听见以后，立刻向大家奔过来。\n 原来罪犯们破坏了高地，离开这里已经快半个钟头了！\n “赫伯特先生呢？”纳布问道。\n 吉丁·史佩菜回到大车旁边来。\n 赫伯特已经昏迷过去了！\n \n
