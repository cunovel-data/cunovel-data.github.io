{"id":5838,"no":28,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 6","content":"Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions searched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have moved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen down.... But the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if a squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was impossible in the dark.\\n\\n \"If it is a joke,\" cried Pencroft, \"it is a very stupid one! To come home and find no staircase to go up to your room by--that\u0027s nothing for weary men to laugh at.\"\\n\\n Neb could do nothing but cry out \"Oh! oh! oh!\"\\n\\n \"I begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!\" said Pencroft.\\n\\n \"Curious?\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"not at all, Pencroft, nothing can be more natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of our dwelling and drawn up the ladder.\"\\n\\n \"Some one,\" cried the sailor. \"But who?\"\\n\\n \"Who but the hunter who fired the bullet?\" replied the reporter.\\n\\n \"Well, if there is any one up there,\" replied Pencroft, who began to lose patience, \"I will give them a hail, and they must answer.\"\\n\\n And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged \"Halloo!\" which was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.\\n\\n The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.\\n\\n There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic of men, and the settlers were not men of that description. In their situation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the seven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met with anything of so surprising a character.\\n\\n Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think, not knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of a satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more unlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not being able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they had had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them.\\n\\n \"My friends,\" at last said Cyrus Harding, \"there is only one thing to be done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances. But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if we cannot eat, we can at least sleep.\"\\n\\n \"But who is it that has played us this cool trick?\" again asked Pencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.\\n\\n Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and when Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The brave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.\\n\\n To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on the sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened, whether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at the return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human being; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be helped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling was occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.\\n\\n Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse. There were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments, tools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over again, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their uneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to see if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his habitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to gain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this respect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.\\n\\n \"It is a joke,\" said Pencroft; \"it is a trick some one has played us. Well, I don\u0027t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.\"\\n\\n As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists, suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters of which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.\\n\\n All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open.\\n\\n Some one had entered Granite House--there could be no more doubt about that.\\n\\n The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing, was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard themselves against a surprise.\\n\\n Pencroft hailed again.\\n\\n No reply.\\n\\n \"The beggars,\" exclaimed the sailor. \"There they are sleeping quietly as if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands, robbers, sons of John Bull!\"\\n\\n When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of \"son of John Bull,\" he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.\\n\\n The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the exterior all was quiet and calm.\\n\\n The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able to escape. But how were they to be got at?\\n\\n Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the communication between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might succeed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys, where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft fastened this to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his shoulder and covered the door.\\n\\n The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed between the two last rounds.\\n\\n The operation had succeeded.\\n\\n Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out between the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite House.\\n\\n \"The rascals!\" shouted the sailor. \"If a ball can do anything for you, you shall not have long to wait for it.\\n\\n \"But who was it?\" asked Neb.\\n\\n \"Who was it? Didn\u0027t you see?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"It was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the ladder during our absence.\"\\n\\n And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor\u0027s words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows, from which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.\\n\\n \"I knew that it was only a joke,\" cried Pencroft; \"but one of the jokers shall pay the penalty for the rest.\"\\n\\n So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the monkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged to the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who are so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert declared it to be an orangoutang.\\n\\n \"What a magnificent beast!\" cried Neb.\\n\\n \"Magnificent, if you like,\" replied Pencroft; \"but still I do not see how we are to get into our house.\"\\n\\n \"Herbert is a good marksman,\" said the reporter, \"and his bow is here. He can try again.\"\\n\\n \"Why, these apes are so cunning,\" returned Pencroft; \"they won\u0027t show themselves again at the windows and so we can\u0027t kill them; and when I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--\"\\n\\n \"Have patience,\" replied Harding; \"these creatures cannot keep us long at bay.\"\\n\\n \"I shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,\" replied the sailor. \"And now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows are up there?\"\\n\\n It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing. Pencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did not think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders, but when and how? this is what they were not able to say.\\n\\n Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show themselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or a paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted by a gun- shot.\\n\\n \"Let us hide ourselves,\" at last said the engineer. \"Perhaps the apes will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on all that may appear.\"\\n\\n The engineer\u0027s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad, the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position, but out of the monkeys\u0027 sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.\\n\\n In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they roasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett and Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to watch under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their post.\\n\\n Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed that they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that, terrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the noise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house or probably even into the store-room. And when they thought of the valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much recommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and there certainly was room for it.\\n\\n \"Decidedly it is too bad,\" said the reporter; \"and the worst of it is, there is no way of putting an end to it.\"\\n\\n \"But we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,\" cried the sailor. \"We could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is there no way of getting at them?\"\\n\\n \"Let us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,\" replied the engineer.\\n\\n \"Oh!\" shouted the sailor, \"and I never thought of that.\"\\n\\n This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite House so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was, it is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately, Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have taken some time.\\n\\n It was already past twelve o\u0027clock, when the colonists, well armed and provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect Heights.\\n\\n But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the dog barking furiously.\\n\\n And all rushed down the bank again.\\n\\n Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.\\n\\n In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause, were trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window to another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to replace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps in their terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists, now being able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or killed, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest, throwing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite House.\\n\\n At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then unroll and fall to the ground.\\n\\n \"Hullo!\" cried the sailor, \"this is queer!\"\\n\\n \"Very strange!\" murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.\\n\\n \"Take care, captain!\" cried Pencroft, \"perhaps there are still some of these rascals.\\n\\n \"We shall soon see,\" replied the engineer, without stopping however.\\n\\n All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the threshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.\\n\\n \"Well now, and the ladder,\" cried the sailor; \"who can the gentleman have been who sent us that down?\"\\n\\n But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.\\n\\n \"Ah, the robber!\" cried Pencroft.\\n\\n And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,--\\n\\n \"Spare him, Pencroft.\"\\n\\n \"Pardon this rascal?\"\\n\\n \"Yes! it was he who threw us the ladder!\"\\n\\n And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was difficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.\\n\\n Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.\\n\\n \"There!\" said Pencroft. \"And what shall we make of him, now we\u0027ve got him?\"\\n\\n \"A servant!\" replied Herbert.\\n\\n The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent race could be turned to account.\\n\\n The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is not much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an orangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor the stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed of an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at table, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon properly, and even drink wine . . . doing everything as well as the best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one of these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous servant.\\n\\n The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad chest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five degrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.\\n\\n \"A handsome fellow!\" said Pencroft; \"if we only knew his language, we could talk to him.\"\\n\\n \"But, master,\" said Neb, \"are you serious? Are we going to take him as a servant?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Neb,\" replied the engineer, smiling. \"But you must not be jealous.\"\\n\\n \"And I hope he will make an excellent servant,\" added Herbert. \"He appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged to use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He will soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.\"\\n\\n \"And they will be,\" replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor against \"the jokers.\"\\n\\n Then, approaching the orang,--\\n\\n \"Well, old boy!\" he asked, \"how are you?\"\\n\\n The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.\\n\\n \"You wish to join the colony?\" again asked the sailor. \"You are going to enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?\"\\n\\n Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.\\n\\n \"And you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?\"\\n\\n Third affirmative grunt.\\n\\n \"This conversation is slightly monotonous,\" observed Gideon Spilett.\\n\\n \"So much the better,\" replied Pencroft; \"the best servants are those who talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give you no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are pleased with you.\"\\n\\n Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor begged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be called Jupiter, and Jup for short.\\n\\n And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯一言不发，站住了。他的伙伴们在黑暗中摸索着石壁，也许是软梯被风吹到旁边去了，也许它掉在地上……可是到处无影无踪。是不是一阵狂风把它吹到半截的平台上去了呢？这一点在黑暗中还无法证实。\\n\\n “假如是开玩笑的话，”潘克洛夫喊道，“这也就太过火了，回到自己的家门口却找不到进屋去的梯子，对于累得要命的人来说，这可不是什么好玩的事！”\\n\\n 纳布无法可施，急得大叫大嚷。\\n\\n “我现在才感到林肯岛上的怪事层出不穷！”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n “奇怪吗？”吉丁·史佩莱接口道，“一点儿也不奇怪，潘克洛夫，再自然也没有了。有人乘我们出去的时候占据了我们的房子，把软梯拉上去了。”\\n\\n “有人，”水手喊道。“你说是谁？”\\n\\n “除了放枪的那个猎人还有谁。”通讯记者接着说，“没有别的，算我们倒媚！”\\n\\n “假如上面有人的话，”潘克洛夫开始不耐烦他说，“我喊他一声，他准会答应的。”\\n\\n “喂！——”水手用霹雳似的声音拉长了这个字喊起来，峭壁和山石间不断传来回声。\\n\\n 他们侧耳静听，好象有一种咯咯的笑声，大家都猜不出它的由来。可是没有人回答潘克洛夫，他一再大声叫唤着，都没有用。\\n\\n 的确，即使是最麻木不仁的人，在这种情况下也会不寒而栗，何况他们还不是那样的人。在他们所处的环境中，每一件事都举足轻重，但是，从他们留居在荒岛上这七个月以来，的确还没有遇到过一件象这样的怪事。\\n\\n 虽然他们由于诧异而忘记了疲劳，然而他们还只能停留在“花岗石宫”下面，他们不知道应该怎样考虑，怎样行动，明知道他们之中谁也不会给自己一个满意的回答，大家还是互相询问，人人都胡乱地猜想，而且愈想愈离奇。纳布由于不能进厨房而感到遗憾，因为他们所带的粮食已经吃得干干净净，现在又没法补充了。\\n\\n “朋友们，”赛勒斯·史密斯终于说，“现在只有一个办法，就是：等到天亮，然后见机行事。我们先回‘石窟’，安下身来，即使没有吃的，至少可以睡一觉。”\\n\\n “可是谁在和我们开这么大的玩笑呢？”潘克洛夫又问了一遍，他犹犹豫豫地，不想离开这个地方。\\n\\n 不管是谁，最行得通的办法还是工程师的建议，到“石窟”去等天亮。在这期间，他们命令托普在“花岗石宫”的窗下看守，托普接到命令以后一声不响。于是这只勇敢的狗就留在悬崖脚下了，它的主人和它主人的伙伴们则在乱石丛中找地方安身。\\n\\n 这些人已经非常疲倦，然而如果认为他们能在“石窟”的沙石上面安眠的话，那就错了。这不仅因为他们急于想知道这是怎么一回事——是事出偶然，一到白天就能真象大自呢？还是有人在故意捉弄他们？——而且在那里睡也极不舒适。但是，不管怎样，他们的住所在当时是被霸占了，一时也没法进去。\\n\\n “花岗石宫”不仅是他们的住所，同时还是他们的仓库。他们的全部武器、仪器、工具、火药、食粮等等都在那里。假如这一切都被洗劫一空，他们要从头做起，制造新武器和新工具的话，这个问题的确是相当严重的。他们焦急不安，每隔几分钟就有一个人去看托普是不是还好好地守在那里。只有赛勒斯·史密斯还象平时那样镇静地等待着，然而，面对着这种不可思议的事实，他那坚强的理智也发挥不出力量来了。同时，当他想到有一种说不出来的权威在他的左右——也许就在上面——的时候，他不禁恼恨起来。吉丁·史佩莱在这方面也有同感，于是他们两个人低声谈论起这莫名其妙的情况，这种情况把他们的智慧和已往的经验全难住了。这个岛上肯定有什么秘密，可是，怎样去揭穿它呢？赫伯特只会幻想，只爱向史密斯问长问短。纳布认为这是他主人的事，要不是怕伙伴们生气的话，这位好心肠的黑人满可以跟在“花岗石宫”里一样安安稳稳地睡一宿。最着急的是潘克洛夫，他简直气疯了。\\n\\n 一这是开玩笑，”潘克洛夫说，“是有人和我们捣蛋。我可不喜欢这种玩笑，这位开玩笑的人最好还是留神一些，假如一旦落到我手里的话，我就要他好看！”\\n\\n 一线曙光才从东方露出来，大家就马上武装起来，回到峭壁旁边的海岸上。朝阳直射着“花岗石宫”，一会儿就会把它照得通亮的。在早晨五点钟的时候，透过遮蔽的枝叶，可以看到紧闭着的窗户。\\n\\n 一切看来都很正常；可是他们出发的时候关好的门现在却敞开了，他们看见以后，不由失声大叫起来。\\n\\n 有人到“花岗石宫”里去过了——这是毫无疑问的。\\n\\n 上半段软梯向来是从门口挂到平台上的，现在还在那里挂着，可是下半段却被拉到齐门槛的地方去了。显然，这些侵略者想用这个方法来防止意外侵袭。\\n\\n 要弄清楚他们是什么样的人，究竟有多少人？这是不可能的，因为，到现在还没有一个人露面。\\n\\n 潘克洛夫又喊了一会儿。\\n\\n 没有人回答。\\n\\n “该死的东西，”水手喊道。“他们安安静静地好象睡在自己家里似的。喂，你们这些强盗，土匪，海寇，约翰牛！”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫是一个美国人，当他骂到“约翰牛”的时候，他认为已经把对方污蔑到极点了。\\n\\n 现在太阳完全升起来了，阳光照亮整个“花岗石宫”的正面，可是里里外外都是鸦雀无声。\\n\\n 他们不知道“花岗石宫”里有没有人，然而从梯子的位置看来显然是有的，同时还可以肯定，不管这些人是谁，他们还没有逃走。可是，怎样才能把他们抓住呢？\\n\\n 赫伯特提议在箭上系一根绳子，然后把箭向门槛上挂下来的软梯上射去——射进软梯的第一个空档里面。这样他们就可以拽箭上的绳子，把软梯从门槛拉到地面上来，恢复地面和“花岗石官”的交通。除此以外，显然没有别的方法；假如射箭的本领好，这个方法是可能成功的。好在弓箭都在“石窟”里，他们还在那里找到一些很轻的木槿绳子。潘克洛夫把它系在一支上等的羽箭上。然后赫伯特就张弓搭箭，瞄准了软梯的下部。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱、潘克洛夫和纳布都后退了几步，这样假如窗口有什么东西出现的话，他们就可以一目了然了。通讯记者举起枪来，把枪托抵在肩窝上，枪口对准“花岗石宫”的门户。\\n\\n 赫伯特拉满弓，那支箭带着绳子直飞出去，正射进软梯的最后两档之间。\\n\\n 他们成功了。\\n\\n 赫伯特马上抓住绳子头，他正打算一下子把软梯拉下来，突然从门缝里伸出一只手来，一把抓住绳子，把它拉进“花岗石宫”去了。\\n\\n “该死的东西！”水手喊道。“假如给你一颗子弹的话，你早就活不成了。”\\n\\n “是谁呀？”纳布问道。\\n\\n “谁？你没有瞧见吗？”\\n\\n “没有。”\\n\\n “是一只猴子，一只蜘蛛猿，一只猩猩，一只狒狒，一只大猩猩，一只猿猴。我们的住所成了猴窠了，它们趁我们不在的时候从梯子上爬进去的。”\\n\\n 这时候，仿佛要证明水手的话没有错似的，有两三只猴子在窗口露出脸来，它们打开窗户，向房屋的主人作了无数个鬼脸。\\n\\n “我早知道是开玩笑了，”潘克洛夫喊道，“可是我们非杀一儆百不可。”\\n\\n 说完以后，水手就举起枪来，瞄准一只猴子放了一枪。一只猴子掉在沙滩上只剩下一口气，其余的都不见了。这只大猴子显然属于猕猴类的第一目。也许是黑猩猩，也许是猩猩，也许是大猩猩，总之，它属于类人猿，这是因为它们长得和人相似因而得名的，可是精通动物学的赫伯特却一口咬定这是一只猩猩。\\n\\n “这个畜生长相多好啊！”纳布喊道。\\n\\n “好就好吧，”潘克洛夫答道，“可是我看还是没法到屋子里去。”\\n\\n “赫伯特是一个射击能手，”通讯记者说，“他的弓还在这儿。不妨再来试一下。”\\n\\n “怎么，这些猴崽子可机灵了，”潘克洛夫说，“它们不会再到窗口来的，我们打不到它们了，我一想到它们如果在房间和仓库里耍起把戏来，就……”\\n\\n “别着急，”史密斯说，“我们决不会被它们弄得毫无办法的。”\\n\\n “它们不下来我真不敢相信，”水手说。“现在，史密斯先生，你知道上面有几打吗？”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫的问题很难回答，少年要想作第二次尝试也不容易，因为梯子的下部又被拉进了门里，下面拉第二把的时候，绳子就断了，软梯却还牢牢地留在原处。情况的确很令人为难。潘克洛夫急得暴跳如雷。从某一方面看起来，这个局面是很滑稽的，然而他却丝毫也不觉得可笑。自然，他们最后是会把侵略者赶出去，重新回到家里去的，可是这要等到什么时候呢：又该怎么办呢？困难就在这里。\\n\\n 两个钟头过去了，在这一段时间内，这些猴子小心翼翼，不敢露面，可是它们仍在里面不出来，有三四次门口和窗户上探出一个鼻子或爪子来，他们马上就给它一枪。\\n\\n “我们躲起来吧，”工程师最后说。“也许它们认为我们去远了，会重新出来的。史佩莱和赫伯特埋伏在石头后面，一看见它们出来就打。”\\n\\n 大家马上就按照工程师的命令去们了，通讯记者和少年在这些人里射击技术最高明，他们找到一个不让猴子看见的地方躲起来，这时，纳布、潘克洛夫和赛勒斯爬上高地，到森林里打猎去了，因为现在已经是早饭的时候，他们连一点余粮也没有。\\n\\n 半个钟头以后，打猎的人带了一些野鸽子回来，他们尽可能把这些野鸽子烤得恰到好处。猴子还是一只也没有出来。吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特把托普留在窗下，去吃早饭了。吃完以后，又回来继续埋伏着。\\n\\n 又过了两个钟头，他们的情况还是没有丝毫好转。猴子消声匿迹，好象已经失踪了似的，实际上它们也许是看到同伴被打死，恐惧起来，又害怕枪声，因此躲到房子的后半部，跑到仓库里去了。他们一想到仓库里所藏的珍贵东西，就急得跳起来，连工程师一再嘱咐的耐心也不顾了，这并不是没有原因的。\\n\\n “真糟糕，”通讯记者说，“最麻烦的是：它闹起来没完没了，我们竟毫无办法。”\\n\\n “可是我们总得想个法子把这些畜生赶出去，”水手喊道。“即使它们有二十个，我们也可以很快地制伏它们的，不过这就必须和它们面对面地干一场。来吧，难道没法抓住它们吗？”\\n\\n “我们想法子从原来湖边的那个洞口到‘花岗石宫’里去吧。”工程师说。\\n\\n “啊！真糊涂！”水手喊道，“我怎么会没想到。”\\n\\n 的确，这是到“花岗石宫”里去，跟这群侵略者打仗和把它们赶出去的唯一办法了。不错，洞口已经被石头和泥土筑成的墙堵住了，现在只有作一次牺牲，但这是很容易修补起来的。幸亏还没有按照赛勒斯·史密斯的计划，把湖水引到高处来淹没洞口，要不然就要多费一些时间了。\\n\\n 他们带着武器，拿了锄头和铲子离开“石窟”，经过“花岗石宫”的窗下，这时候已经十二点多钟了；他们把托普留在原地，然后爬上慈悲河左边的堤岸，往眺望岗走去。\\n\\n 可是他们朝着这个方向走了还不到五十步，就听见托普怒吠起来。\\n\\n 于是大家又从河堤上冲下去。\\n\\n 他们一转弯就发现情况变了。\\n\\n 一大群猿猴不知为什么突然受了惊，正打算逃走。有两三只从一个窗口往另外一个窗口爬去，灵活得象杂技演员似的。其实把梯子放回原处就很容易下来，它们却根本没有打算这么做，大概惊慌得晕头转向，它们已经忘记可以这样逃跑了。现在这些居民们瞄准起来毫不困难，于是他们开枪射击。许多猿猴，死的死，伤的伤，一阵叫喊，都跌到房间里去了。其他往外冲的，跌在地上，摔得粉身碎骨，几分钟以后，居民们估计“花岗石宫”里一只活猴也没有了。\\n\\n “哈哈！”潘克洛夫大喊起好来。\\n\\n “不要喊这么多好，行不行！”史佩莱说。\\n\\n “为什么？”水手说，“它们都被杀光了。”\\n\\n “我同意，”通讯记者说，“但是，空喊好还是不能进屋子的。”\\n\\n “那么，我们还是到水洞口去吧！”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n “对！”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“但是最好还是……”\\n\\n 这时候，仿佛是回答史密斯的话似的，只见一条软梯从门槛上滑了下来，一直挂到地上。\\n\\n “啊！”水手一面望着史密斯，一面喊道，“真奇怪！”\\n\\n “真奇怪！”工程师喃喃地说，他首先跳上梯子。\\n\\n “留神，史密斯先生！”潘克洛夫大声说，“这些该死的畜生也许还没有死光呢……”\\n\\n “我们马上就可以知道了，”史密斯一面回答，一面还是继续往上爬。\\n\\n 大家都跟在他的后面，一会儿他们就来到门前了。他们到处搜索。但是一个人也没有，在这群猴子“光临”过的仓库里同样也没有一个人。\\n\\n “那么，梯子，”水子喊道，“是哪位大爷给我们送下来的呢？”\\n\\n 这时候只听得一声大喊，接着就有一只很大的猩猩——它原先是躲在走廊里的——冲到屋子里来，纳布在后面紧紧地追赶着。\\n\\n “啊，你这个强盗！”潘克洛夫喊道。\\n\\n 他手拿着利斧，正打算往猩猩的脑袋上劈去，赛勒斯·史密斯一把抓住他的胳膊，说：\\n\\n “留下它吧，潘克洛夫。”\\n\\n “饶了这个畜生？”\\n\\n “是的！梯子是它扔给我们的！”\\n\\n 工程师的语气非常奇怪，使人听了以后简直不知道他说的是真话还是假话。\\n\\n 可是大家还是扑在猩猩的身上，它勇敢地自卫着，但很快就抵挡不住，被捆起来了。\\n\\n “得！”潘克洛夫说，“现在已经捉住了，我们该怎么处置它呢？”\\n\\n “当我们的仆人！”赫伯特答道。\\n\\n 少年并不是开玩笑，因为他知道，这种聪明的动物是可以加以利用的。\\n\\n 于是大家来到猿猴的近旁仔细端详它。它是类人猿的一种，类人猿的颜面角和澳洲、南非的土人比起来并不见得相差很远。这是一只猩猩，它既不象大猩猩那样凶猛可怕，又不象狒狒那样常常会轻举妄动；既不象南美洲长尾猿那样肮脏，也不象北非叟猴那样暴躁，更不象犬面狒狒那样本性恶劣。类人猿中有一种类型具有许多特点，证明它们的智慧几乎是和人相等的，这只猩猩正是属于这一个类型。如果在家里留用的话，它们可以伺候人、扫地、洗衣服、擦皮鞋，会规规矩矩地使用刀、叉、汤匙，甚至还能喝酒……做什么事情都能和久经训练的仆人一样。标丰也有一只这样的猩猩，很久以来，一直象他的一个忠实而热心的仆人。\\n\\n 在“花岗石宫”里捉住的这只猩猩个子非常大，有六英尺高，体格匀称美观，胸膛宽阔，头颅不大不小，颜面角达六十五度，脑壳圆圆的，鼻子向外突出，长着一身光亮而柔软的毛，总之，这是一只优良品种的类人猿。它的眼睛虽然比人的小一些，却露出智慧的光芒，雪白的牙齿在胡髭下闪闪发光，此外，它的下巴底下还长着一小撮褐色的卷须。\\n\\n “真漂亮！”潘克洛夫说，“假如我们懂得它的话，就可以和它交谈了。”\\n\\n “可是，主人，”纳布说，“真的吗？我们真的要收它当仆人吗？”\\n\\n “是的，纳布，”工程师笑道。“你可别嫉妒。”\\n\\n “我相信它会伺候得很好的，”赫伯特又加了一句。“它看起来很年轻，很容易教导，我们不必用强力压制它，也不必象有些人那样，拔掉它的牙齿。只要待它好一些，它很快就会爱护它的主人的。”\\n\\n “会的。”潘克洛夫说，他对“开玩笑的人”的愤怒早忘得一干二净了。\\n\\n 于是他走到猩猩前面。\\n\\n “老兄！”他问道，“你好吗？”\\n\\n 猩猩哼了一声，却没有什么怒意。\\n\\n “你愿意加入我们的小队吗？”水手接着问道。“你愿意为赛勒斯·史密斯先生服务吗？”\\n\\n 猩猩又哼了一声，表示回答。\\n\\n “待遇是一日三餐，别的没有了，你满意吗？”\\n\\n 它第三次肯定地哼了一声。\\n\\n “这样谈话未免大简单了。”吉丁·史佩莱说。\\n\\n “简单些好，”潘克洛夫说，“最好的仆人该是沉默寡言。没有待遇，听见吗，伙计？我们先不给你待遇，可是将来假如认为你还不错的话，那时候再加倍。”\\n\\n 于是小队里就新添了一个成员了。在给它起名字的时候，水手提出一项要求：为了纪念他过去所认识的一只猿猴起见，他请求叫它朱波德，简称杰普。\\n\\n 就这样，没有经过其他仪式，小杰普就在“花岗石宫”里住下来了。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2895.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious Island","description":"简介：
