{"id":5860,"no":50,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 8","content":"So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to kill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but to treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for just now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not being seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements, therefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last for a tolerable length of time. Ayrton\u0027s house had been provided with all that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was probable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as follows:\\n\\n The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they had reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the right bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they could not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited. There they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton\u0027s arrival had surprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and--the rest may be easily imagined!\\n\\n Now, the convicts,--reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,--were roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to their attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.\\n\\n \"Wait! There is nothing else to be done!\" repeated Cyrus Harding. \"When Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and have satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our grand expedition at the same time--\"\\n\\n \"As the search for our mysterious protector,\" added Gideon Spilett, finishing the engineer\u0027s sentence. \"An, it must be acknowledged, my dear Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when it was most necessary to us!\"\\n\\n \"Who knows?\" replied the engineer.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked the reporter.\\n\\n \"That we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett, and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert\u0027s life before everything.\"\\n\\n This was the colonists\u0027 saddest thought. Several days passed, and the poor boy\u0027s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a suitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the wounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly sulphurous,--which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration was much less abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was surrounded!--Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated. He was besides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad\u0027s wounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert\u0027s wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much nor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing, knowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that which most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well performed.\\n\\n In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better. He had begun to take some nourishment.\\n\\n The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at his nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft\u0027s efforts, who talked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him the most improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that he was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert, contented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to defend Granite House.\\n\\n \"Humph!\" said Pencroft, \"these pirates! they are gentlemen who have no right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by kindness! I\u0027ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good bullet!\"\\n\\n \"And have they not been seen again?\" asked Herbert.\\n\\n \"No, my boy,\" answered the sailor, \"but we shall find them, and when you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will dare to meet us face to face!\"\\n\\n \"I am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!\"\\n\\n \"Well! your strength will return gradually! What\u0027s a ball through the chest? Nothing but a joke! I\u0027ve seen many, and I don\u0027t think much of them!\"\\n\\n At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication occurred, Herbert\u0027s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated, --if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated?\\n\\n \"No,\" said Spilett more than once, \"I have never thought of such a contingency without shuddering!\"\\n\\n \"And yet, if it had been necessary to operate,\" said Harding one day to him, \"you would not have hesitated?\"\\n\\n \"No, Cyrus!\" said Gideon Spilett, \"but thank God that we have been spared this complication!\"\\n\\n As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic of that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not a time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone on the island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each other. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some circumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount. It appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate, had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and a half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might be said that they had had everything their own way. The island had abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take advantage of what she offered them.\\n\\n The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all that could only be for a time.\\n\\n In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.\\n\\n In fact, the convicts\u0027 ship had appeared in the waters of the island, and if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of them, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the island, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived. Ayrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This was often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the intervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served them so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had he in his turn succumbed?\\n\\n No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined that because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were men to despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face, they analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they stood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last to strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against it.\\n\\n 事实说明，罪犯们还在附近监视着畜栏，企图把居民们一个一个地杀死。对待这些强盗没有别的办法，只能把他们当作野兽。现在居民们必须加倍小心，因为目前的形势对这帮匪徒有利，他们看得见居民，居民却看不见他们，他们可以采取冷不提防的突击，而本身却不会受到意外的进攻。于是史密斯作了一些安排，打算住在畜栏里。这里的食品还可以维持一个相当长的时期。艾尔通的房子里备有各种生活必需品，由于居民们来得突然，罪犯们来不及把东西抢走就吓跑了。根据吉丁·史佩莱的估计，事情的经过可能是这样的：这六个罪犯在岛上登陆以后，沿着南部海滨前进，他们从盘蛇半岛的海岸这边一直穿到海岸那边，没有冒险进入远西森林，却到了瀑布河口。从河口沿着右岸可以一直走到富兰克林山的支脉下，在那里不难找到一个安身的地方，这样，很快就发现当时没有人住的畜栏了。他们在这里正式地住了下来，随时准备着实现他们可怕的阴谋。艾尔通回到畜栏里来使他们吃了一惊，可是他们到底想法子打败了这个不幸的人——其余的情况就不难想象了！\\n\\n 不错，现在只剩下了五个罪犯，可是他们却都是全副武装，而且在森林里出没。要冒险到森林里去，就等于送上门去让他们打；对于他们的攻击，既不能预防，又不能阻止。\\n\\n “等着吧！现在想不出别的办法！”赛勒斯·史密斯一再地说。“等赫伯特好了以后，我们要在岛上进行一次全面的搜捕，那时候就可以拿这帮罪犯出一口气了。这就是我们大规模出征的目的，同时……”\\n\\n “我们还要寻找那位神秘的保卫者，”吉丁·史佩莱接着说出了工程师要说的话。“啊，应该承认，亲爱的赛勒斯，在这次最紧要的关头，他却没有保护我们！”\\n\\n “谁知道呢？”工程师说。\\n\\n “这话是什么意思？”通讯记者问道。\\n\\n “我们还没有到山穷水尽的地步呢，亲爱的史佩莱，他也许会在另外的一个场合，运用他的创造性的力量的。可是这不是当前的重要问题，现在重要的是赫伯特的性命问题。”\\n\\n 这是居民们最担心的事。又过了几天，幸而可怜的少年，情况并没有恶化。冷水始终保持着适当的温度，因此到现在为止，创口一点儿没有发炎。由于靠近火山，水里含有少量的硫，通讯记者甚至觉得它能直接起医疗作用。多亏周围的人不断看护，赫伯特保住了性命，化脓比以前少得多了，热度也下降了。由于他们严格地限制他的饮食，因此他的身体变得非常虚弱，而且以后还要继续一个时期；然而清凉的饮料却可以尽量喝，同时，对他说来，只要保持绝对的休息就有莫大的好处。赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱和潘克洛夫敷裹少年的创口的技术已经十分高明。屋子里的布料全都给他用光了。赫伯特的创口上盖着敷布和棉花，包扎得不松不紧，以便使创口合拢而不致最后出现发炎的反映。通讯记者在敷裹的过程中十分仔细，他知道这道手续的重要性，他一再向伙伴们谈到绝大部分的外科医生都承认的一件事实，那就是：良好的敷裹比良好的手术更加少见。\\n\\n 十天以后，11月22日，赫伯特的身体好得多了。他已经开始吃一些营养品。他的脸上重新出现了原有的光彩，他睁着亮晶晶的眼睛对看护们微笑着。尽管潘克洛夫费尽气力，不住嘴地和他说话，把最稀奇古怪的故事讲给他听，好不让他有机会开口；可是他还是说了几句。赫伯特问到艾尔通，他以为艾尔通还在畜栏里，因为没有看见他，感到有些奇怪。水手为了不让赫伯特难受，只好回说艾尔通和纳布一起保卫“花岗石宫”去了。\\n\\n “哼！”潘克洛夫说，“这些强盗！这些家伙丝毫也不值得怜借！史密斯先生还想用仁义道德去说服他们呢：我也要给他们一些仁义道德，不过我的仁义道德就是大粒的子弹！”\\n\\n “以后没有再发现他们吗？”赫伯特问道。\\n\\n “没有，孩子，”水手回答说，“可是我们会找到他们的，等你好了以后，我们就可以瞧瞧，看这些暗箭伤人的胆小鬼敢不敢露面！”\\n\\n “我的身体还很弱呢，我的潘克洛夫！”\\n\\n “不要紧！你的体力慢慢就会恢复的！一颗子弹打穿胸口算得了什么？简直是开玩笑：这种事情我见得多了，没有什么了不起的！”\\n\\n 情况终于好转了，要是不再有什么共发症，赫伯特的痊愈就可以肯定了。可是，如果他的伤势比现在严重得多——譬如枪弹在身体内部没出来，或是必须锯断手足——那时候移民们该怎么办呢？\\n\\n “真的，”史佩莱不止一次地说，“一想到这种意外的时候，我就止不住要打寒噤！”\\n\\n “可是，如果到了不动手术就不行的时候，”史密斯有一天对他说，“你会犹豫吗？”\\n\\n “不会，赛勒斯！”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可是谢天谢地，幸亏没有发生这样的共发症！”\\n\\n 居民们过去曾经屡次运用他们的简单而良好的理智进行分析讨论，这次和往常一样，多亏他们的一般常识丰富，结果又成功了！但是会不会遇到用尽他们的全部科学知识，仍旧解决不了困难的时候呢？社会上是必须有各种人在一起互相依赖的，岛上却只有他们这一群人。赛勒斯·史密斯非常明白这一点，有时候他问自己，如果遇到他们无能为力的情况时，那应该怎么办呢？他还有一种看法，他和他的伙伴们一向是幸运的，现在似乎进入一个不幸的阶段了。可以这样说，自从他们逃出里士满，两年半以来，他们向来是想什么就能够有什么。岛上供给了他们大量的矿物、植物和动物。自然界不断地供应各种物资，他们也就不断地依靠自己所掌握的科学知识，充分地加以利用。\\n\\n 因此，小队是十分幸福的。并且，在某些情况下，还有一种不可思议的力量在帮助他们！……可是，这一切都仅仅是过去的情况。\\n\\n 一句话，赛勒斯·史密斯感到他们开始走下坡路了。\\n\\n 的确，由于罪犯们的船来到荒岛的沿海一带，虽然海盗们可说是神秘地毁灭了，但是至少其中有六个人逃脱了这场灾难。他们在岛上登了陆；要想捉住这五个残匪几乎是不可能的。艾尔通一定已经被他们杀害了，他们携带着武器，第一次使用武器，就险些要了赫伯特的命。史密斯常常想：这仅仅是厄运给移民们的第一次打击吗？通讯记者也常常这样反复地思索；他还感到，一向给他们很大帮助的神奇而有效的援救，现在对他们也不灵了。不管这个神秘的人是谁，反正肯定是有这么一个人的，他是不是已经离开荒岛了呢？是不是也轮到他没有办法的时候了呢？\\n\\n 这些问题是无法解答的。但是我们却不能认为，由于史密斯和他的伙伴们说出这样的话来，他们就灰心绝望了。决不是那样。他们面对着自己的处境，分析了一切可能，随时准备应付任何一种局面；他们坚忍不拔，不屈不挠地迎接未来。即使最后要遭到灾难的打击，他们也会勇往直前地进行斗争的。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2917.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious Island","description":"简介： The Mysterious Island is a novel by Jules Verne, published in 1874.
