{"id":5843,"no":33,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 11","content":"Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid clothing. The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff. Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders, combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt. This felt could then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished the flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion. Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted. The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations, the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning was done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for four-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be compressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no doubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets. This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times, and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding\u0027s engineering qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling-mill. Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in question, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling. The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success. The wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on the one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the softening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by the beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly neither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel. It was \"Lincolnian felt,\" and Lincoln Island possessed yet another manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick bedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter of 1866-67. The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his great regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which he hoped to finish in time for next spring. The sailor\u0027s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for curiosity\u0027s sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this desert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a comparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him some anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be unable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island, what would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters? Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he himself could give no sufficient reason. \"Now,\" said the engineer one day to him, \"I must observe, my friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.\" \"Only to leave it for a few days,\" replied Pencroft, \"only for a few days, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is like!\" \"But it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.\" \"I know that beforehand.\" \"Then why venture there?\" \"To know what is going on in Tabor Island.\" \"But nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.\" \"Who knows?\" \"And if you are caught in a hurricane?\" \"There is no fear of that in the fine season,\" replied Pencroft. \"But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.\" \"Pencroft,\" replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor\u0027s shoulder, \"if any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom chance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves?\" \"Captain Harding,\" replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, \"we shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this voyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen our tight- rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together--I fancy, I say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don\u0027t conceal from you that your boat will be a masterpiece.\" \"Say \u0027our\u0027 boat, at least, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer, disarmed for the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without convincing either the sailor or the engineer. The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had previously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to it were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should never be allowed to pass without someone going to it. Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest at a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake. To the engineer\u0027s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones. An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but because it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate with the rest of mankind. Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps carry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons. But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island from any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly. But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without difficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert\u0027s gun had slightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten feet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the Pacific. Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would soon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to him that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to communicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the albatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but that it would return there so soon as it was set free. Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes came to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized reporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain the article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the Honorable James Bennett! Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it to forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was fastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then liberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not without some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the misty west. \"Where is he going to?\" asked Pencroft. \"Towards New Zealand,\" replied Herbert. \"A good voyage to you,\" shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect any great result from this mode of correspondence. With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House, mending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails for their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case. During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of either wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking while they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed with profit to all. It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke, they could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been complete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far from their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with them. They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had left, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could not but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the affairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his views, and his prognostics. It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say-- \"But now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement to which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of being sooner or later completely stopped?\" \"Stopped! And by what?\" \"By the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of minerals.\" \"Yes, the most precious indeed,\" replied the engineer; \"and it would seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond, which is simply pure carbon crystallized.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say, captain,\" interrupted Pencroft, \"that we burn diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?\" \"No, my friend,\" replied Harding. \"However,\" resumed Gideon Spilett, \"you do not deny that some day the coal will be entirely consumed?\" \"Oh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them.\" \"With the increasing consumption of coal,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"it can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.\" \"Doubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.\" \"For how long a time?\" asked the reporter. \"For at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.\" \"That is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our great- grandchildren!\" observed Pencroft. \"They will discover something else,\" said Herbert. \"It is to be hoped so,\" answered Spilett, \"for without coal there would be no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to modern civilization!\" \"But what will they find?\" asked Pencroft. \"Can you guess, captain?\" \"Nearly, my friend.\" \"And what will they burn instead of coal?\" \"Water,\" replied Harding. \"Water!\" cried Pencroft, \"water as fuel for steamers and engines! water to heat water!\" \"Yes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,\" replied Cyrus Harding, \"and decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by some inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same time. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants, and there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the productions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us. I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the future.\" \"I should like to see that,\" observed the sailor. \"You were born too soon, Pencroft,\" returned Neb, who only took part in the discussion by these words. However, it was not Neb\u0027s speech which interrupted the conversation, but Top\u0027s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which had before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run round the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior passage. \"What can Top be barking in that way for?\" asked Pencroft. \"And Jup be growling like that?\" added Herbert. In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation, and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry. \"It is evident,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"that this well is in direct communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time to time to breathe at the bottom.\" \"That\u0027s evident,\" replied the sailor, \"and there can be no other explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!\" added Pencroft, turning to the dog, \"and you, Jup, be off to your room!\" The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained in the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the incident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer. During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and frost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter, and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although this winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls; the sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of Granite House. When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet. During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out, owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral. Happily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes, which spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on Prospect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east, suffered considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed and the paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if it formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved. During the first week of the month of August the weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm which it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again became intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero. On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn Marsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there, and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against these birds. Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part in this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse, did not join them, but remained at Granite House. The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to reach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top and Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into execution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone. Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth of which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the waters of the lake. Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well branches besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards other parts of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He had resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during the absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now presented itself. It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope ladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely fastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent. The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and there, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well. The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these points by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either recently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides. He saw nothing suspicious. When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water, which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior of the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being could force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the rocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the sea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth beneath the water, it could not be answered. Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying to himself,-- \"I have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!\" 冬季来临了，这里的六月相当于北半球的十二月，当前的大事就是做又暖和又结实的衣服。 他们已经把畜栏里摩弗仑羊的毛剪下来了，现在需要把这些宝贵的纺织原料织成毛料。 赛勒斯·史密斯既没有刷毛机、梳毛机、磨光机、绷架、绞丝机和纺织机，又没有自动纺车和织布机，因此只好采用一种比较简便的方法来代替纺织工序。他打算利用羊毛纤维的特点——在强大的压力下，这种毛质纤维会粘在一起——用简单的方法制造毛毡。毡的制造过程非常简易，羊毛压缩得愈紧，就愈能保暖。摩弗仑羊的毛很短，用来制毡非常合适。 工程师在伙伴们的协助下，——潘克洛夫只好再度把造船工作搁在一旁——开始了准备工序，这道工序的目的就是清除渗透在羊毛里的脂肪和油质，也就是兽脂。清洁工序是这样操作的：先把羊毛放在盛满水的大桶里，保持着70度的温度，浸了二十四小时以后，再拿出来在小苏打溶液里彻底洗清，等它挤干到一定程度，就可以压榨了，也就是说，可以用来生产出一种结实的毛料了，这种毛料当然是粗糙的，拿到欧美的工业中心去不值一文，可是在林肯岛的市场上，它却非常受人重视。 这种制造毛料的方法，一定在很早以前就有人使用了，事实上，最原始的毛料就是用现在史密斯打算采用的方法制造出来的。在制造压榨羊毛的机器时，史密斯又施展了工程师的本领；他知道应该怎样巧妙地利用海滩上瀑布的机械动力——这种动力直到目前还没有人利用过——来发动一台水力压榨机。 没有比这个更简单的了。把羊毛放在凹槽中间，用沉重的木槌不断交替地捶击，这就是他们要做的机器。几世纪以来，人们一直采用这种机器，直到后来发明了压滚，人们才开始不再捶打，而采用了有规律的压滚方法。 这项工作在赛勒斯·史密斯正确的指示下，获得了完全的胜利，他们事先把羊毛用肥皂水浸过，一方面便于交织、压榨和使羊毛柔软，另一方面又可以免得羊毛在捶击以后会收缩，等羊毛从压榨机里出来之后，就成为厚毡了。羊毛原材料本来很粗糙，由于交织的细密，结果制成的毛料不但适合做衣服，又适合做被毯。当然，这既不是美丽诺呢、细毛呢、开斯米、花毛呢、纺绸、缎子、丝毛呢、驼绒、呢子，也不是法兰绒。这是“林肯毡”，林肯岛上的一种工业品。居民们现在有温暖的衣服和很厚的被子，他们可以毫无顾虑地迎接1866—1867年的冬天了。 6月20日，严寒开始了，潘克洛夫原打算在开春以前完成造船工程，这时候只好暂时停止，他感到非常遗憾。 水手最大的愿望就是到达抱岛去作一次探险，但是史密斯却不赞成纯粹为了好奇而航海，因为在这样一个荒芜不毛的山石上，显然是不可能找到什么东西的。这样一只船——这只船未免稍微嫌小一些——在陌生的海洋上航行一百五十海里，不能不使他有点顾虑。万一他们的船入海以后，到不了达抱岛，而又没法回来。那么在这灾难重重的太平洋中，该怎么办呢？ 史密斯和潘克洛夫常谈论这个计划，他发现潘克洛夫对这次航海的要求很迫切，可是他却说不出一个充分的道理来。 “你瞧，朋友，”有一天工程师对他说，“一方面你对林肯岛赞不绝口，时常谈到一旦非离开这儿不可的时候，你会怎样的悲伤，另一方面你又第一个想离开林肯岛。” “只是想离开这儿几天，”潘克洛夫答道，“只是几天，史密斯先生。去去就回来，看看那个小岛上究竟是个什么样子！” “可是它还不如林肯岛呢。” “这我早就知道了。” “那么干吗冒险上那儿去呢？” “去了解一下情况。” “那儿什么也没有，也不可能有什么。” “那谁敢说！” “假如你遇到飓风呢？” “在天气好的季节里，是不用担心这个的，”潘克洛夫说，“可是，史密斯先生，既然我们要防备万一，我要求让赫伯特和我两个人一道去。” “潘克洛夫，”工程师拍拍水手的肩膀说，“假如你或是赫伯特——别忘了，他只是碰巧才成为我们的孩子的——一旦发生什么不幸，你想我们后悔也来不及啊！” “史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫的信心还是毫不动摇，“我们不会使你们担忧的。航海的事等将来到了时候再谈吧。我想，等你看见我们的船装备好了，等你看见我们乘着它下海，环绕我们的荒岛——我们要一块儿去——我敢说，你就会毫不犹豫地让我去了。不瞒你说，你的船一定是头等的。” “还是说‘我们的’船吧，潘克洛夫。”工程师答道，他暂时让步了。谈到这儿告一段落，水手和工程师谁也没有说服谁，都等待以后接着再谈下去。 将近六月底的时候，下了第一场雪。畜栏里预先就准备了大量的饲料，不必每天都去了，他们决定至少每星期派人去一次。 他们又布置了陷阱，史密斯制造的玩意儿也试验过了。他们把鲸鱼骨弄弯后，外面冻上一层冰，然后涂上厚厚的脂肪，放在森林的边缘——野兽到湖边去经常路过的地方。 阿留申群岛渔夫的发明十分灵验，工程师非常高兴。他们得到一打狐狸，几只野猪，甚至还有一只美洲豹；这些动物死在地上，伸直了的鲸骨把它们的胃都刺穿了。 有一件事情必须提一下，不仅因为它本身有趣，而且因为这是他们和外界联系的第一次尝试。 吉丁·史佩莱已经想过很多次了，但是没有肯定，究竟在瓶子里装一封信扔在海里呢——也许海水会把它们冲到一个有人居住的海岸上去的——还是利用鸽子带信呢？ 可是他们的海岛和外界相隔一千二百英里，一心指望信鸽或是瓶子远渡重洋，那怎么能成呢！简直是开玩笑。 6月30日，赫伯特一枪打下一只信天翁，它的腿受了些轻伤，大家好不容易把它捉住了。这是一只非常美丽的鸟，两翅展开长达十英尺，它连太平洋也飞得过去。 赫伯特很想把这只艳丽而雄伟的飞鸟留养下来，因为它的伤不重很快就会痊愈，而且他认为可以把它养驯，可是史佩莱向他解释，他们不应该错过机会——利用这个使者和太平洋沿岸地区取得联系。假如这只信天翁是从有人居住的地方来的，那么把它放走以后，它一定会马上回到那里去的。 吉丁·史佩莱不愧为一个新闻记者，也许他很想找一个机会，把他们在林肯岛上的冒险事迹写成惊心动魄的通讯寄到外界去。假如这篇通讯能寄到可敬的编辑约翰·裴尼特那里去，这对于《纽约先驱报》的记者史佩莱本人和刊载这篇通讯的那份报纸来说，是多么大的成功啊！ 于是吉丁·史佩莱写了一篇简单的报道放在一个一点不透水的口袋里，袋上写了几句话，恳切拜托捡到的人把它寄给《纽约先驱报》。他们知道这种鸟惯于在海面休息，就把这个小口袋系在信天翁的脖子上而没有系在它的脚上；然后他们就把这个快速的飞行使者放到天空去了，他们眼看着它飞往朦胧的西方，一直到看不见为止，大家心里都很激动。 “它上哪儿去？”潘克洛夫问道。 “向新西兰飞去了。”赫伯特回答说。 “祝你一帆风顺！”水手大声喊道，其实他自己对这种通讯方式并没有抱多大的希望。 随着冬天的到来、他们又开始在“花岗石宫”里工作了，有的缝衣服或是干一些别的事情，有的就利用气囊上多得用不完的材料制造船帆。 七月里天气非常寒冷，可是他们木材、煤炭都不缺少。赛勒斯·史密斯在餐厅里装设了第二个壁炉，他们就在那里消磨冬天漫长的夜晚。他们一面工作一面谈话，闲下来的时候就朗读，在这一段时间里大家都得益不少。 晚饭后，屋子里烛光明亮，人们烤着温暖的炉火，喝着热气腾腾的接骨木咖啡，静听外面狂风怒号，烟斗里散发着芬芳的香气，对居民们来说，这真是一种莫大的享受。假如离乡背井、音信隔绝的人也谈得上乐趣的话，那么他们的乐趣可算是达到极点了。他们常常谈到祖国和久不见面的朋友，以及美利坚合众国的伟大——她的力量会一天天增大起来的；赛勒斯·史密斯很关心国家大事，他谈起很多往事、个人的见解以及对将来的看法，他的伙伴们都听得津津有味。 有一天史佩莱偶然说： “亲爱的赛勒斯，你预言所有那些工商业都会不断发展，可是它们会不会迟早有一天要发生完全停滞的危机呢？” “停滞！为什么？” “因为缺少煤，说句公道话，煤是最宝贵的矿产。” “是的，煤的确是最宝贵的，”工程师答道，“金刚石其实不过是碳的结晶，大自然所以要产生金刚石，好象就是为了要证明煤的宝贵。” “史密斯先生，你是说，”潘克洛夫插嘴说，“我们炉子里烧的是样子象煤的金刚石吗？” “不，朋友。”史密斯答道。 “不管怎么样，”吉丁·史佩莱接着说，“总有一天煤会烧完的，你不能否认吧？” “唉！煤的矿藏还多得很呢，十万个矿工每年才开采一万万英担，到现在为止要想把煤采完还早呢。” “随着煤的消耗量一天天增加，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“我们可以预料得到，十万个矿工很快就要增加到二十万个矿工，开采量也要加倍了。” “当然，欧洲的煤矿很快都要使用新机器开采了，可是等欧洲煤矿开采完毕以后，美洲和澳洲的煤矿还可以维持相当长一个时期的工业消耗。” “可以维持多久呢？”通讯记者问道。 “至少可以维持二百五十年到三百年。” “我们这一代是可以放心了，可是我们后代的前途可糟糕了！”潘克洛夫说。 “人们会发现别的东西的。”赫伯特说。 “但愿如此，”史佩莱说，“因为没有煤就没有机器，没有机器就没有火车、轮船、工厂以及文明时代不可缺少的一切东西！” “可是他们能发现什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道，“你猜得到吗，史密斯先生？” “大致上可以猜得出来，朋友。” “他们用什么来代替煤呢？” “水。”史密斯答道。 “水！”潘克洛夫喊道，“用水来做轮船和引擎的燃料，用水来烧水！” “是的，不过水已分解成它原有的元素了，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“当然是用电来分解的，到那时候水就成为一种强有力而且可以操纵自如的力量了，一切伟大的发现都是根据一种不可思议的规律，彼此吻合，同时逐渐完善起来的。是的，朋友们，我相信总有一天水会变成燃料，组成水的氢和氧也许分开来，也许合起来，它会成为热和光的无尽源泉，它的力量之大，是煤所比不上的。将来轮船的藏煤室和火车的煤水车里装的就不再是煤，而是这两种压缩气体了，这两种气体在炉子里燃烧起来，会产生极大的热能。因此我们不必担心。只要地球存在一天，它就会供给人类一天的需要；只要我们不缺少动物、植物和矿物三界，我们就不会缺少光和热。我相信，等煤用完了以后，我们就要用水来取得热能和温暖了。水就是将来的煤。” “我希望能够亲眼看得到。”水手说。 “你生得太早了，潘克洛夫。”纳布说，他在讨论中只说了这么一句话。 可是，打断谈话的并不是纳布，而是托普，它忽然又怪声地叫起来，上一次工程师就曾因此感到诧异。内部通道的尽头有一口井，这时候托普边叫边绕着井口奔跑。 “托普为什么那样叫呢？”潘克洛夫问道。 “怎么杰普也吼叫起来了？”赫伯特加上一句。 的确，猩猩也和狗一样，表现出明显的不安，说也奇怪，这两个动物愈来愈暴躁和愤怒了。 “很明显，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这个井是直通大海的，大概常常有海里的动物到井底来呼吸。” “不错，不会有别的原因了。”潘克洛夫转过身来对狗说，“别叫，托普！还有你，杰普，到你自己的房里去！” 猩猩和狗都安静下来了，杰普回去睡觉，托普还留在房里，当天晚上，它每隔一会儿总要低低地咆哮几声。他们没有进一步谈这个问题，但是工程师却始终为这件事而皱着眉头。 七月的下余几天不是霜就是雨。气温并没有去年冬天低，最冷的时候也只不过华氏8度。这年冬天虽然不太冷，可是风雪却特别多，此外，海潮还常常威胁着“石窟”的安全。海面上常常有滔天的巨浪，好象是被潜流掀起来似的，冲击在“花岗石宫”的石壁上，发出轰然的巨响。 居民们倚在窗口，只见滚滚的海水冲到岩石下面来，被撞得粉碎，愤怒的海潮显然是无能为力，这壮丽的景色不禁使他们大加赞赏。波涛带着耀眼的泡沫奔腾，整个的海滩，消失在狂澜里，峭壁好象浮在浪花高这一百多英尺的海面上。 在这样的风暴里，冒险出去是很困难的，甚至非常危险，因为大树还经常被刮倒，可是居民们还是保证每星期至少到畜栏去一次。幸亏这块圈地有富兰克林山的东南支脉作为屏障，受不到飓风多大的袭击，树木、棚屋和栅栏都保存下来，可是眺望岗上的家禽场却由于正迎着东面刮来的大风，损失就相当大了。鸽棚的屋顶被刮走了两次，栅栏也被吹倒了。这些都需要重新修建，而且应该修得比以前更要结实，因为林肯岛显然在太平洋的一个最危险的区域里。它好象在大旋风的中心，狂风从四面八方不断地侵袭它，就象鞭子不断抽打陀螺似的，只不过是这个陀螺始终保持静止，而鞭子围绕着它转动。八月的第一个星期，天气比较正常，大气也恢复了原先似乎一去不复返的宁静。可是一旦平静以后，天气又严寒起来，寒暑表降到华氏零下8度（相当于摄氏冰点以下22度）。 8月3日，他们到荒岛东南靠近潦凫沼地的地方去打了一次猎，这次打猎，他们已经计划了好几天。猎人们看到一些到这里来过冬的水禽，看得眼红了。这里有无数的野鸭、鹬、小水鸭，大家一致同意过一天专门来打这些鸟。 不仅是吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特，连潘克洛夫和纳布也参加了这次打猎。只有赛勒斯·史密斯推说有工作要做，没有参加，他一个人留在家里。 打猎的人答应在傍晚的时候回来，然后就向气球港出发，直奔潦凫沼地。托普和杰普也和他们一起去了。他们刚刚过了慈悲河，工程师就把吊桥扯起来回家了，他打算单独做一件事。 他要仔细察看井的内部，井口和“花岗石宫”的通道在同一平面上，它一直通往大海，过去它就是格兰特湖的输水道。 为什么托普时常环绕着井口跑来跑去？为什么它要发出那样奇怪的叫声？大概是有什么东西使它不安，把它吸引到井边来的吧？为什么杰普也和托普一样显得急躁不安呢？这口井除了通往大海以外，还有别的支路吗？它能通向荒岛的其他地方吗？这都是赛勒斯·史密斯想要知道的。他一心要趁他的伙伴们不在家的时候探井，现在这个时机到了。 只要有绳梯就很容易下到井底。自从有了升降梯以后，绳梯就放在那里不用了。工程师把梯子拿到井口，井口的直径将近六英尺，他把软梯的上端牢牢系住，另一端一直放到井里。然后他点上一盏灯，拿了一把左轮枪，腰间插了一把弯刀，就开始下井了。 井里空空洞洞，周围有很多突出的尖石，灵活的动物很可以沿着这些突出的尖石爬到洞口来。 工程师注意到这一点，他借着灯光仔细地察看了这些尖石，然而他并没有发现有任何痕迹或是破损的地方可以说明最近或是过去曾被当为阶梯使用过。赛勒斯·史密斯又往下走了几档，他举起灯来，四下探照。 他没有看见任何可疑的东西。 当工程师跨到最后一档的时候，他到达水面了，这时候水面十分平静。不论是水面上还是井内的其他地方，都没有任何孔道可以通向峭壁的内部。史密斯用刀柄在石壁上敲了几下，墙上发出坚实的声音。这是结结实实的花岗石，绝没有一种生物能在里面开出一条路来。海滩的岩石下层土地下，有一条沟道把大海和井底连接起来；要由大海到井底，然后爬到井口来，必须穿过这条沟道，这一点只有水里的动物才能做到。至于这条沟道通到什么地方，在海岸的哪一点，那地方水有多深，谁也回答不出来。 赛勒斯·史密斯察看完毕以后，就上来了，他拉上软梯，盖好井口。他回到餐厅里的时候，还在沉思地自言自语道： “什么也没有看见，可是那里肯定是有东西的！”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2900.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious
