{"id":5855,"no":45,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 3","content":"The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive, and did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their side, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last shots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal with her match, and had left the coast.\n But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could see a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the \"Speedy.\"\n \"These, my friends,\" said the engineer, \"are the arrangements which appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It hides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting their attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and consequently capable of resisting them. I therefore propose that we divide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted at the Chimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think it would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and four muskets. Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot, we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to fear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they do against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage by throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the necessity of meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side. We must therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but with a sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they must be killed!\"\n Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece of work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these arrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely dissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and Ayrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a mile. The four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.\n The posts were arranged in the following manner:--\n Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.\n Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.\n As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet. In this way, shots being fired from four different points at once, the convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely peopled and strongly defended.\n In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being cut off by the brig\u0027s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their boat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.\n Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time wrung each other\u0027s hands.\n Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.\n In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.\n None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely distinguish the brig in the fog.\n It was half-past six in the morning.\n Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued from the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.\n The \"Speedy\" now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as Harding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast.\n The sinister black flag floated from the peak.\n The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board were pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a moment\u0027s notice.\n In the meanwhile the \"Speedy\" remained silent. About thirty pirates could be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others posted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively surveying the island.\n Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an account of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had this half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and with whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver at them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot? Had he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his object? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts\u0027 minds. But what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before which the \"Speedy\" had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was, perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be absolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had the inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter the locality before he allowed his men to venture there.\n During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be observed on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even with his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the settlers crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his attention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers hiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on the bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out, at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited.\n At eight o\u0027clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board the \"Speedy.\" A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They were armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars, and the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered the island. Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to land, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The pirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width. However, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the direction followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate into the channel, but would land on the islet.\n Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them coming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.\n The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the water at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that it was Bob Harvey\u0027s intention to bring his brig as near as possible to the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed every movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks which would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more than two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.\n At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the rocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line fell backwards into the boat. Ayrton\u0027s and Pencroft\u0027s balls had struck them both at the same moment.\n Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued from the brig\u0027s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two marksmen remained unhurt.\n Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued its way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However, instead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat coasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the bullets.\n They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a semicircular line, still protected by the brig\u0027s guns, they proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy.\n Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their number might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous position.\n A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction. Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.\n Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the \"Speedy\u0027s\" guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.\n Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as they were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of the boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.\n The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.\n The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current, it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.\n Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries had certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be destroyed one by one.\n It was now seen how advantageous the engineer\u0027s arrangements had been. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.\n Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current, could get alongside the \"Speedy.\" Frightful cries were heard when they returned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired with no results.\n But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly by the effect of the evening\u0027s potations, threw themselves into the boat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their places, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the Mercy.\n The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.\n However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two well- directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran across the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the channel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran to hide themselves in the Chimneys.\n They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet was overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment, fresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat was rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her, were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself, carried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the Mercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to preserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of the balls.\n The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts, of whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their disposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility reach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges being raised.\n \"Hallo,\" exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, \"hallo, captain! What do you think of it, now?\"\n \"I think,\" answered the engineer, \"that the combat will now take a new form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!\"\n \"They won\u0027t cross the channel,\" said the sailor. \"Ayrton and Mr. Spilett\u0027s rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry more than a mile!\"\n \"No doubt,\" replied Herbert; \"but what can two rifles do against the brig\u0027s guns?\"\n \"Well, the brig isn\u0027t in the channel yet, I fancy!\" said Pencroft.\n \"But suppose she does come there?\" said Harding.\n \"That\u0027s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!\"\n \"It is possible,\" said Ayrton. \"The convicts might profit by the high tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no longer tenable.\"\n \"Confound them!\" exclaimed Pencroft, \"it really seems as if the blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.\"\n \"Perhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!\" observed Herbert.\n \"We must wait!\" answered Cyrus Harding.\n \"But Mr. Spilett and Neb?\" said Pencroft.\n \"They will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is yours and Spilett\u0027s rifles which must speak now.\"\n It was only too true. The \"Speedy\" was beginning to weigh her anchor, and her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would be rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already weakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering the channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton\u0027s opinion, could not believe that she would dare to attempt it.\n In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel.\n Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers, in ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing the latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did not believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they surveyed the islet, and examined the shore.\n Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton\u0027s and Gideon Spilett\u0027s rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.\n Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and pulled away with all their strength.\n \"Eight less!\" exclaimed Pencroft. \"Really, one would have thought that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!\"\n \"Gentlemen,\" said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, \"this is becoming more serious. The brig is making sail!\"\n \"The anchor is weighed!\" exclaimed Pencroft.\n \"Yes, and she is already moving.\"\n In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The \"Speedy\" was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been raised, she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island.\n From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short distance, to the brig\u0027s guns, without being able to reply with any effect? How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?\n Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even, since they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that? The pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having their revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.\n However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all, would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep outside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive.\n \"Never!\" repeated Pencroft, \"Bob Harvey will never, if he is a good seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig, if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without his vessel?\"\n In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen that she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light, and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had absolute command over his vessel.\n The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.\n The pirate\u0027s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.\n Soon the \"Speedy\" reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood across the mouth of the Mercy.\n \"The scoundrels! they are coming!\" said Pencroft.\n At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.\n The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at the moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not without attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached them.\n \"Spilett! Neb!\" cried the engineer. \"You are not wounded?\"\n \"No,\" answered the reporter, \"a few bruises only from the ricochet! But that cursed brig has entered the channel!\"\n \"Yes,\" replied Pencroft, \"and in ten minutes she will have anchored before Granite House!\"\n \"Have you formed any plan, Cyrus?\" asked the reporter.\n \"We must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the convicts cannot see us.\"\n \"That is, my opinion, too,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"but once shut up--\"\n \"We must be guided by circumstances,\" said the engineer.\n \"Let us be off, then, and make haste!\" said the reporter.\n \"Would you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?\" asked the sailor.\n \"What would be the use of that, Pencroft?\" replied Harding. \"No. We will not separate!\"\n There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig, but two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told them that the \"Speedy\" was at no great distance.\n To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to rush into the large room, was the work of a minute only.\n It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the \"Speedy,\" surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was incessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they were hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding\u0027s precaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door, penetrated into the passage.\n \"We are discovered!\" exclaimed Pencroft.\n The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage which concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite.\n The colonists\u0027 situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered. They could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the stone, which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be done but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave their dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by frightful cries!\n Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows--\n The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal crew!\n 这一夜平安无事地过去了。居民们面临着生死关头，并没有离开他们在“石窟”的岗位。另一方面海盗们好象并没有上岸的企图。自从船上对艾尔通放了最后一枪以后，就没有再放一枪，甚至也没有一点声音可以说明它还在小岛附近。莫非它已经拔锚启航了？也许它怕和对手交锋，已经离开海岸了吧？\n 但是，并不是这么一回事，破晓的时候，居民们透过清晨的薄雾可以看见一团朦胧的黑影，那就是飞快号。\n “朋友们，”工程师说，“雾可以使海盗看不见我们，使我们的行动不会引起海盗们的注意。最要紧的是，要让那些罪犯认为岛上的人很多，足够抵抗他们。因此，在雾散以前，我认为我们最好这样准备：把我们的人分成三路，第一路在‘石窟’这儿把守，第二路在慈悲河口把守。至于第三路，我想最好放在小岛上，因为在那里可以阻止他们——至少能牵制他们——登陆。我们有两支步枪和四支滑膛枪。每个人都武装起来，我们有的是弹药，可以尽量放。我们不必害怕船上的滑膛枪，就是大炮也不必顾虑。有这些岩石掩护着。他们还能怎么样呢？我们只要不从‘花岗石宫’的窗口往外开枪，他们就不会用炮把它炸得不可收拾了。所怕的就是进行肉搏战，因为罪犯们人数多。所以，我们一定要想法子不让他们登陆，同时又不能暴露自己。因此，不要舍不得用弹药。尽量开枪，但是要瞄准了再放。我们一个人要争取打死八个到十个敌人，一定要把他们完全消灭掉！”\n 赛勒斯·史密斯已经把他们的情况解释清楚了。他的嗓音很镇定，好象在调度一件工作，而不是指挥一场战斗似的。他的同伴们都默默地同意了这个部署。现在要做的，就是在雾散以前各就各位，没有别的事了。纳布和潘克洛夫立刻到“花岗石宫”上面去，拿了大量的弹药回来。吉丁·史佩莱和艾尔通都是射击能手，他们每人拿了一支射程几乎能够达到一英里的步枪。四支滑膛枪分给了史密斯、纳布、潘克洛夫和赫伯特。\n 各个人的岗位是这样布置的：\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和赫伯特埋伏在“石窟”附近，负责把守“花岗石宫”下面的海岸。\n 吉丁·史佩莱和纳布埋伏在慈悲河口的岩石中间，河上的吊桥已经扯起来，他们负责阻止任何人乘船渡河或在对岸登陆。\n 艾尔通和潘克洛夫要划船渡过海峡，在小岛上各据一点。这样，火力可以同时从四个不同的地点发射，罪犯们就会认为岛上不但有很多人，而且有坚强的防卫了。\n 如果艾尔通和潘克洛夫不能阻止海盗登陆，而且跟着将要被海盗的小船切断退路，他们就应该乘船回到岸上来，到受威胁的地点去。\n 在出发到各个阵地以前，移民们作了最后一次的握手。\n 潘克洛夫拥抱着他的孩子赫伯特，竭力抑制住自己的感情，然后他们就分手了。\n 过了一会儿，史密斯和赫伯特在一起，通讯记者和纳布在一起，都消失在岩石后面了。艾尔通和潘克洛夫也只用了五分钟就顺利地渡过海峡，登上了小岛，各自隐藏在东岸的岩石丛中间。\n 他们都看不见了，他们自己也看不清雾里的那只船。\n 这时候是早上六点半。\n 不久雾就逐渐散开，船的中桅在水气里露了出来。几分钟后大片的浓雾滚过海面，很快就被微风吹散了。\n 这时候飞快号完全露了出来，它的锚链上系着一根曳索，船头向北，左舷对着海岛。正象史密斯所估计的那样，它离岸不过一又四分之一英里。\n 阴沉沉的黑旗还在船上飘扬着。\n 工程师在望远镜里看见船上的四门炮都对着荒岛。显然它们随时都准备开火。\n 这时候，飞快号还是没有动静。大约有三十个海盗在甲板上走动着。有几个在船尾；另外有两个站在桅索中间，手里拿着小型望远镜，仔细观察海岛。\n 显然，鲍勃·哈维和他的部下是很难理解夜里船上所发生的情况的。那个半裸体的人用强力打开了火药库的门，并且和他们进行了格斗，他一共开了六枪，打死了他们的一个，打伤了两个，这个人最后被他们打死了吗？他到岸上去了吗？他是从哪里来的呢？他的目的是什么？真象鲍勃·哈维所想的那样，想炸毁双桅船吗？这些问题一定使罪犯们完全摸不着头脑。但是，有一点他们是可以肯定的：飞快号面前的这个无名海岛上是有人居住的，而且这里可能有许多移民随时准备保卫它。然而，不论是岸上也好，还是高岗上也好，都看不见一个人。海滩上好象完全没有人似的，至少是找不到一点房屋的影子。是不是居民们都逃到内陆去了呢？这个海盗船长大概就是这样揣测的，他非常精细，一定会首先进行侦察，然后再让他的部下上岸的。\n 一个半钟头过去了，船上还是没有准备进攻或登陆的样子。显然，鲍勃·哈维还在迟疑不决。尽管使用倍数最大的望远镜，潜伏在岩石里的居民，他还是一个也看不见。至于“花岗石宫”的窗口所遮的绿枝和爬藤，虽然在光滑的岩石上显得相当触目，大概根本就没有引起他的注意。的确，他怎么想得到，在这样高的地方，人们竟能把坚硬的花岗石台成一个可以居住的房屋呢。从爪角起沿着整个的联合湾直到颚骨角，没有任何东西可以使他认为岛上有人或是可能有人。\n 八点钟的时候，移民们终于看见飞快号上有人行动了。一只小船放了下来，七个人跳了进去。他们都带着滑膛枪。他们一个人掌着操舵索，四个人操着桨，另外两个人伏在船头侦察岛上的行动，随时准备开火。他们的目的很明显是要作一次侦察，而不是要登陆。假如打算登陆的话，来的人一定会更多的。海盗们从他们的了望台上可以看到，荒岛的海岸有一个小岛掩护着，岛和小岛之间的海峡宽半英里。可是，赛勒斯·史密斯根据小船的前进方向立刻判明，他们并不打算进入海峡，而是要在小岛上登陆。\n 潘克洛夫和艾尔通各自隐藏在岩石的夹缝里，看着小船直向他们划来，等着它进入射程以内。\n 小船小心翼翼地前进着，每隔很长时间才划一次桨。现在可以看见，有一个罪犯手里拿着一根铅垂线，打算测量被慈悲河冲陷的海峡有多深。这说明鲍勃·哈维打算尽量把船靠近海岸。船上有三十来个海盗在索具之间注视小船的行动，并寻找着可以安全靠岸的界标。小船在离小岛不到两锚链的地方停住了。掌舵的人站起身来，寻找最适合上岸的地方。\n 这时候只听见两声枪响。轻烟从小岛的岩石间袅袅上升。掌舵的人和测水的人都倒在船里了。艾尔通和潘克洛夫的枪弹同时打中了他们两个人。\n 几乎同时又听到更大的一声炮响，双桅船的船边喷出一团烟雾，一个炮弹落在掩护艾尔通和潘克洛夫的岩石顶上，炸得碎石横飞，但是两个射击手都没有受伤。\n 小船上的人破口大骂，并且立刻继续往前驶来。掌舵的已经换了一个人，其他的人迅速地划着奖。出乎意料的是它不但没有掉头回去，反而沿岸驶来，打算绕过小岛的南端。海盗们排命划船，想逃出步枪的射程。\n 他们绕了半个圆圈之后，来到离遗物角岸边五锚链以内的地方，继续在双桅船大炮的掩护下，向慈悲河口驶去。\n 他们的意图显然是想进入海峡，切断小岛上移民的归路，不管小岛上有多少人，要使他们处在两船的火力之间这个非常不利的地位里。\n 小船继续对着这个方向前进了一刻钟。周围一点声音也没有，海面上风平浪静。\n 潘克洛夫和艾尔通知道自己有被切断的危险，但是他们并没有离开岗位，他们不愿在进攻的敌人和飞快号的炮火前暴露自己；同时他们相信，防守着河口的纳布和吉丁·史佩莱，以及埋伏在“石窟”附近岩石间的赛勒斯·史密斯和赫伯特会援助他们的。\n 在第一次射击以后二十分钟，小船离慈悲河不到两锚链了。这时候正开始涨潮，由于海峡很窄，水势照例非常湍急。海盗们的船被冲到河口去了，他们费尽了九牛二虎之力，才保持在海峡的中流。但是，当海盗驶进慈悲河口的适当距离以内的时候，纳布和史佩莱马上敬了他们两枪，这两枪都没有落空，小船里又有两个人倒下了。\n 船上立刻对准冒烟的地方又开了一炮，但还是和刚才一样，只是把岩石打得粉碎。\n 现在小船上只剩下三个有用的人了。它顺着水流，象箭一般地冲过了海峡，经过史密斯和赫伯特的前面。他们认为还不在射程以内，就没有射击。然后小船在仅存的双桨推动下，绕过小岛的北端，回到双桅船那里去了。\n 到目前为止，岛上的人是没有什么可抱怨的。他们的敌人却倒了大楣，已经有四个海盗不是死，就是重伤了。相反的，居民们却都没有受伤，而且每枪都打中了敌人。假如海盗继续这样进攻，假如他们还打算利用小船登陆的话，那么，他们是可以一个一个地被歼灭的。\n 现在可以看出工程师调度有方了。海盗们会认为对方不但人多势众，而且武器优良，不是轻易可以取胜的。\n 小船逆水划行，半个钟头以后，才靠拢飞快号。当他们和受伤的人回到船上时，只听得一片鬼哭神嚎，接着又毫无目的地开了两三枪。\n 但是，现在又有十来个罪犯怒不可遏地跳进小船来了，他们可能还受着夜来狂欢的影响。同时又放下第二只小船来，里面坐着八个人。第一只小船直向小岛划去，打算赶走小岛上的移民，第二只准备强袭慈悲河口。\n 在这种情况之下，潘克洛夫和艾尔通的处境显然非常危险，他们觉得非回本岛不可了。\n 但是，他们还是等第一只小船进入射程以内，然后准确地开了两枪，小船上的人立刻陷入了混乱状态。潘克洛夫和艾尔通这才冒着密集的火力，离开了他们的阵地，飞快地穿过小岛，跳进小船。当第二只小船到达南端时，他们已经渡过海峡，藏到“石窟”里去了。\n 他们刚回到赛勒斯·史密斯和赫伯特的身旁，海盗们就占据了小岛各处。这时候慈悲河口也传来了枪声。海盗的第二只小船正在很快地向慈悲河口驶去。船上的八个人当中，有两个被吉丁·史佩莱和纳布打得奄奄一息。小船在没法控制的情况下往礁石上撞击，到慈悲河口的时候，小船进水了。但是，那六个活着的人高举着滑膛枪以防浸水，却登上了河的右岸。等他们发觉自己暴露在埋伏的火力范围内的时候，就向着遗物角枪弹打不到的地方逃去了。\n 实际情况是这样的：小岛上有十二个罪犯，其中有几个肯定是受伤了，但是他们还有一只小船。岛上有六个罪犯，由于吊桥都已经扯起来，不能过河，因此他们是到不了“花岗石宫”那里的。\n “喂，”潘克洛夫闯进“石窟”，大声说，“喂，史密斯先生，现在，你看该怎么办？”\n “我想，”工程师答道，“现在转入一个新的战斗局面了。罪犯们决不会这么傻，甘心守住这么不利的阵地！”\n “他们渡不过海峡的，”水手说。“有艾尔通和史佩莱先生在那里，就可以阻挡他们。你知道，他们的步枪能打到一英里以外去呢！”\n “当然，”赫伯特答道，“但是，两支步枪怎么能抵挡双桅船上的大炮呢。”\n “船还没有到海峡里来呢！”潘克洛夫说。\n “但是，假如它到海峡里来呢？”史密斯问道。\n “那是不可能的，它要是那样做，就可能要搁浅和复灭了！”\n “这还是可能的，”艾尔通说，“在落潮的时候，不错，可能有搁浅的危险；但是罪犯们也许会乘涨潮的时候到海峡里来的。那时候，在它的炮火下，我们的阵地就守不住了。”\n “该死！”潘克洛夫喊道，“这帮可恶的家伙真好象是在起锚似的。”\n “我们也许只好躲到‘花岗石宫’里去了！”赫伯特说。\n “还是再等一会儿！”赛勒斯·史密斯说。\n “可是史佩莱先生和纳布呢？”潘克洛夫说。\n “他们到时候会上我们这儿来的。艾尔通，准备好。现在该用到你和史佩莱的步枪了。”\n 果然，飞快号起锚了。它显然打算驶近小岛。退潮的时间已经过去了，潮水还要上涨一个半钟头，在这种情况下，双桅船前进起来是非常方便的。至于说开进海峡，潘克洛夫不同意艾尔通的意见，他认为双桅船是不敢这样冒险的。\n 这时候，小岛上的海盗已经逐渐来到对岸边上，和本岛相隔只有一道海峡了。\n 海盗们只有滑膛枪，因此伤不着埋伏在“石窟”和慈悲河口的居民。海盗们想不到对方备有射程遥远的步枪，因此自己暴露在对方的火力之下还不知道。于是，他们就在毫无掩蔽的情况下，观察小岛，并巡视海岸。\n 他们的妄想不久就破灭了。艾尔通和吉丁·史佩莱的步枪响了起来。毫无疑问，枪弹给罪犯们带来了不幸的消息，其中有两个倒下去了。\n 于是他们都惊慌起来。其余的十个人顾不得伤亡的伙伴，都在小岛的另一边飞快地逃去，连滚带爬地上了乘来的小船，拚命划开了。\n “少了八个了！”潘克洛夫喊道。“的确，史佩莱先生和艾尔通简直就好象听了口令，同时开枪似的。”\n “诸位，”艾尔通一面说，一面装上子弹，“情况更加严重了。双桅船准备开动了！”\n “它在起锚呢！”潘克洛夫叫道。\n “是的，它已经动了。”\n 事实上，他们已经能够清清楚楚地听到绞盘的声音。飞快号起初是被锚拉住的，起锚以后，它就开始向岸边漂过来了。风正从海面上吹过来，船上张起了三角帆和前桅帆，渐渐地靠近了海岛。\n 慈悲河和“石窟”这两个阵地上的人隐藏得好好的，但是他们却隐藏不了激动的情绪。一旦在逼近眼前的敌船炮火面前暴露自己，他们就完全没法还手了。还有比这个更可怕的吗？怎样才能阻止海盗们登陆呢？\n 赛勒斯·史密斯充分感到这一点，他思忖着该怎么办。不久大家就要他作出决定了。但是，该怎样决定呢？仗着储藏的食品充足，躲在“花岗石宫”里，一连几个星期，甚至几个月地困守在那里吗？这样固然也好！但是以后怎么办呢？海盗们还会成为岛上的主人，他们会恣意蹂躏它，到了一定的时候，他们会用报复方法屠杀被围困在“花岗石窟”里的人。\n 不过，现在还有一个最后的机会：鲍勃·哈维也许不会冒险把船开到海峡里来，而只停留在小岛的外边。要是这样的话，他离海滨还有半英里，在这段距离以外，射击的威力是不会太大的。\n “决不会！”潘克洛夫重复说，“假如鲍勃·哈维是一个航海老手，他决不会到海峡里来！他一定知道，当海水不高的时候，双桅船是会遇到危险的！丢了船以后，他该怎么办呢？”\n 这时候，双桅船已经靠近小岛了。可以看得出来，它正努力往下方开。风力很小，潮流的力量也大大地衰退了，鲍勃·哈维可以完全控制住他的船。\n 它循着小船走过的路线，对海峡进行侦察，并且大胆地往海峡里开进来。\n 现在海盗的企图非常明显：他打算把航侧炮火对着“石窟”，向打死同伴的开枪地点进行反击。\n 飞快号很快就来到了小岛的顶端，顺利地绕了过去．船上扯起主帆，抢着风，直向慈悲河口的对面驶来。\n “该死的东西！他们来了！”潘克洛夫说。\n 这时候，纳布和吉丁·史佩莱回到赛勒斯·史密斯、艾尔通、水手和赫伯特这里来了。\n 通讯记者和他的同伴在撤退以前看出最好放弃慈悲河的阵地，因为在那里简直没法应付双桅船，于是他们就采取了这个聪明的举动。在面临着紧要关头的时候，移民们最好还是团结在一起。吉丁·史佩莱和纳布是从岩石后面躲躲闪闪地跑回来的，虽然引起了一阵射击，但是并没有打中他们。\n “史佩莱！纳布！”工程师大声说，“你们没有受伤吗？”\n “没有！”通讯记者答道，“仅仅是枪弹跳起来碰伤了点儿，那只该死的船已经开到海峡里来了！”\n “是的，”潘克洛夫说，“十分钟内，它就要停在‘花岗石宫’的前面了！”\n “你有什么计划吗，赛勒斯？”通讯记者问道。\n “现在还来得及，我们只好躲到‘花岗石宫’里去了，罪犯们不会看见我们的。”\n “我同意，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“不过，万一被围困起来……”\n “到那时候我们再见机行事吧。”工程师说。\n “那么，我们快走吧！”通讯记者说。\n “史密斯先生，让艾尔通和我留在这里可以吗7”水手问道。\n “这有什么用呢，潘克洛夫？”史密斯回答说。“不，我们不要分散！”\n 现在丝毫也不能浪费时间了。移民们离开了“石窟”。弯曲的山石遮挡着他们，因此双桅船上的人没有发现他们撤退。但是两三声枪响，和子弹打碎岩石的声音说明飞快号离他们已经不远了。\n 移民们跳进升降梯，上升到“花岗石宫”的门口，奔进大厅，前后仅仅用了一分钟。前一天晚上他们关在家里的托普和杰普还在里面呢。\n 他们回来得正是时候。居民们透过树枝可以看见飞快号在烟雾绦绕中开进了海峡。枪声不断地响着，四门大炮对着已经没有人占据的慈悲河阵地和“石窟”盲目地轰击。岩石被打成了碎片。每发一炮，海盗们都欢呼一阵。幸亏史密斯把窗户遮了起来，大家都希望“花岗石宫”或者能够幸免。但是，正在这时候，忽然有一颗炮弹，穿过屋门，打到走廊里来。\n “我们被发现了！”潘克洛夫喊道。\n 也许移民们还没有被发现，但是有一点是肯定了：鲍勃·哈维认为这部分悬崖上所遮的枝叶有些可疑，因此就开了一炮。他立刻加强了进攻，第二炮打开了遮蔽着的树叶，花岗石壁上的洞隙暴露出来了。\n 移民们陷入绝境了。掩蔽所已经暴露出来。他们既不能阻挡猛烈的炮火，又不能够保护这片石壁——在炮火的轰击下，碎石在他们的周围横飞着。现在唯一的办法是到“花岗石宫”的上层甬道里去躲避。至于住房，只好让它破坏了。正在这时候，忽然传来一阵低沉的响声，接着就是一片凄惨的叫声。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的同伴们连忙向一个窗口奔去。\n 一股水柱猛不可当地把双桅船抛了起来，一下子把它冲成两爿，不到十秒钟的工夫，连船带人都沉到海中了！\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2912.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious
