{"id":5869,"no":59,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 17","content":"Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the artificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the \"Nautilus\" was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel. An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back upon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the \"Nautilus\" which millions could not have purchased, and to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching. During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed the condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in the heart and head. The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to render any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no terrors. \"We can do nothing,\" said Gideon Spilett. \"But of what is he dying?\" asked Pencroft. \"Life is simply fading out,\" replied the reporter. \"Nevertheless,\" said the sailor, \"if we move him into the open air, and the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.\" \"No, Pencroft,\" answered the engineer, \"it is useless to attempt it. Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He has lived for a dozen years on board the \u0027Nautilus,\u0027 and on board the \u0027Nautilus\u0027 he desires to die.\" Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding\u0027s reply, for he raised himself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,-- \"You are right, sir,\" he said. \"I shall die here--it is my wish; and therefore I have a request to make of you.\" Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man. They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling. He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from the splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d\u0027oeuvres of the Italian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and bronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the after-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful productions of the sea-- marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device, inscribed over the pediment of the museum--the motto of the \"Nautilus\"-- \"Mobilis in mobile.\" His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas. Cyrus Harding respected the captain\u0027s silence, and waited till he should speak. After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his whole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said, \"You consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?\" \"Captain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.\" \"Promise, then,\" continued Captain Nemo, \"to carry out my last wishes, and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.\" \"We promise,\" said Cyrus Harding. And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions. \"Gentlemen,\" resumed the captain, \"to-morrow I shall be dead.\" Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain arrested him. \"To-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the \u0027Nautilus.\u0027 It is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their resting-place shall be mine.\" These words were received with profound silence. \"Pay attention to my wishes,\" he continued. \"The \u0027Nautilus\u0027 is imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but, although egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the abyss, and there bury my remains.\" The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man. \"To-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,\" continued the captain, \"yourself and companions will leave the \u0027Nautilus,\u0027 for all the treasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted. That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a future day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself and your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but that they will prosper.\" After a few moments\u0027 repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness, Captain Nemo continued,-- \"To-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the \u0027Nautilus,\u0027 and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the vessel.\" \"It shall be done, captain,\" answered Cyrus Harding. \"Good. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but, before leaving the \u0027Nautilus,\u0027 go to the stern and there open two large stop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will penetrate into the reservoirs, and the \u0027Nautilus\u0027 will gradually sink beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.\" And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,-- \"Fear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!\" Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they had nothing to do but to conform to them. \"I have your promise, gentlemen?\" added Captain Nemo. \"You have, captain,\" replied the engineer. The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave him for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the event of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, \"I shall live until to-morrow, sir.\" All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and arrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was established, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical power of the \"Nautilus.\" The \"Nautilus\" was a masterpiece containing masterpieces with itself, and the engineer was struck with astonishment. The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above the water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and in which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the \"Nautilus\" over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance. Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they were vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their hearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often aided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at the point of death. Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince Dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface. \"What a man!\" said Pencroft. \"Is it possible that he can have lived at the bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found peace there any more than elsewhere!\" \"The \u0027Nautilus,\u0027\" observed Ayrton, \"might have enabled us to leave Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.\" \"Good Heavens!\" exclaimed Pencroft, \"I for one would never risk myself in such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!\" \"I believe, Pencroft,\" answered the reporter, \"that the navigation of a submarine vessel such as the \u0027Nautilus\u0027 ought to be very easy, and that we should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no lee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the ocean are as calm as those of a lake.\" \"That may be,\" replied the sailor, \"but I prefer a gale of wind on board a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not beneath it.\" \"My friends,\" said the engineer, \"it is useless, at any rate as regards the \u0027Nautilus,\u0027 to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The \u0027Nautilus\u0027 is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it. Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of the fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo\u0027s wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it.\" After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his companions again descended to the interior of the \"Nautilus.\" There they took some refreshment and returned to the saloon. Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile even curled his lips. The colonists drew around him. \"Gentlemen,\" said the captain, \"you are brave and honest men. You have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed your conduct. I have esteemed you--I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr. Harding.\" Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it affectionately. \"It is well!\" he murmured. He resumed,-- \"But enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to leave it?\" \"To return, captain!\" answered Pencroft quickly. \"To return, Pencroft?\" said the captain, with a smile. \"I know, it is true, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now is, and it seems to you a paradise!\" \"Our project, captain,\" interposed Cyrus Harding, \"is to annex it to the United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately situated in this part of the Pacific.\" \"Your thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,\" continued the captain; \"your toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One\u0027s native land!--there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I loved!\" \"You have some last wish to transmit,\" said the engineer with emotion, \"some souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains of India?\" \"No, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race, and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.--But to return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and beyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live alone! You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln Island, and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those wretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.\" \"We propose to construct a vessel,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"sufficiently large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner or later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too many recollections ever to forget it.\" \"It is here that we have known Captain Nemo,\" said Cyrus Harding. \"It is here only that we can make our home!\" added Herbert. \"And here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if--\" replied the captain. He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said simply,-- \"Mr. Harding, I wish to speak with you--alone!\" The engineer\u0027s companions, respecting the wish, retired. Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying man had confided to him. Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the power of reaction against his physical weakness. The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the \"Nautilus\" for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish it from day in the cavern. Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents of his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold. Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death. At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that attitude to compose himself for death. By one o\u0027clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, \"God and my country!\" he quietly expired. Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo. Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton\u0027s eyes. Neb was on his knees by the reporter\u0027s side, motionless as a statue. Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead, said solemnly, \"May his soul be with God!\" Turning to his friends, he added, \"Let us pray for him whom we have lost!\" Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain by carrying out his dying wishes. Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the \"Nautilus,\" taking with them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which contained wealth amounting to millions. The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the \"Nautilus.\" The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the side of the submarine vessel. The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line, were two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in the submersion of the vessel. The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the \"Nautilus,\" slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake. But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves. The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while the cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of electric light faded away, and soon after the \"Nautilus,\" now the tomb of Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed. 天亮了，但是曙光照不到洞窟的深处。这时候正在涨潮，海水淹没了洞窟的入口。从诺第留斯号的天窗里射出去的人造光还是和原来一样照向远处，光亮夺目，浮船周围的海水泛起一片银波。 这时候尼摩船长精疲力竭地倒在长沙发上。打算把他搬到“花岗石宫”里去住是不行的，因为他已经表示过，要和那些无价之宝守在一起，在诺第留斯号里等待即将到来的死亡。 尼摩船长虚脱了很长时间，几乎完全失去了知觉。赛勒斯·史密斯和吉丁·史佩莱小心地观察了这个垂死的人的情况。他的体力显著地衰退着。过去一度强壮有力的身躯，现在成了一个即将出窍的灵魂寄托的躯壳了。他的全部的生命都集中在心脏和头脑里。 工程师和通讯记者悄悄地商量了一下。还能帮助这个垂死的人吗？即使不能挽救他的生命，能不能使他多活几天呢？他说过自己是已经没法救活的人了，他毫不害怕地静等着死亡。 “我们没有办法了。”吉丁·史佩莱说。 “可是他死的原因是什么呢？”潘克洛夫问道。 “一句话，生命衰退了。”通讯记者回答说。 “不过，”水手说，“要是我们把他抬到外面阳光底下去，吸些新鲜空气，他也许会好过来的。” “不，潘克洛夫，”工程师回答说，“这种尝试是没有用的。再说，尼摩船长决不会答应离开他的船。他在诺第留斯号上已经住了三十年了，他死也要死在这里。” 尼摩船长一定听见赛勒斯·史密斯的话了。他稍稍抬起身子。他的声音更加微弱，但却始终是那么清楚。 “你说得对，先生，”他说。“我要死在这里……这是我的愿望。我对你有一个请求。” 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴都到长沙发旁边来了。这时他们把坐垫给他放好，让垂死的人躺得更舒服一些。 电灯的亮光透过天花板上的花玻璃照亮了整个的大厅。他们只见船长在观看房里的奇珍异宝。他依次观赏了美丽的隔板挂毡上的图画——那些意大利、佛兰达斯、法兰西和西班牙大师的杰作；雕像座上的大理石像和铜像；贴近后半部隔板的华丽的风琴，饲养着各种珍奇水族的养鱼缸——里面有海藻、植虫、极其名贵的珍珠项圈；最后，他的目光停留在这个博物馆的人字墙上，上面刻着题铭，那是诺第留斯号的一句箴言： “动中之动。” 他带着珍惜的神情观看这些艺术界和自然界的珍品，似乎这是最后的一眼了。他多年来寄居在大海深处，所看到的就仅限于这些东西。 赛勒斯·史密斯没有打扰船长的沉思，等待他重新开口。 过了几分钟——在这几分钟之内，他无疑是在回顾自己的一生——尼摩船长转过来对居民们说： “各位先生，你们认为对我应该尽什么义务吗？” “船长，相信我们，假如能延长您的寿命的话，我们情愿献出我们的生命。” “那么，”尼摩船长接着说，“你们只要答应我实现我最后的愿望，就算报答了我为你们所做的一切了。” “我们答应您。”赛勒斯·史密斯说。 这个诺言把他自己和他的伙伴们都包括在内了。 “各位先生，”船长说，“明天我就要死了。” 赫伯特正要叫出声来，船长做了一个手势，制止了他。 “明天我就要死了。我不希望埋在别处，只求葬在诺第留斯号里。这就是我的坟墓！我的同伴们都长眠在大海的深处，我也要和他们长眠在一起。” 居民们默默地听着他的话。 “尊重我的愿望，”他接着往下说。“这个洞窟的出口堵死了，诺第留斯号困在里面出不去。但是虽然没法出去，至少沉在这个深渊里，把我的遗骸葬在这里是不成问题的。” 居民们恭恭敬敬地听着垂死的人所说的话。 “明天等我死了以后，史密斯先生，”船长说，“您和您的伙伴们就离开诺第留斯号。让全船的财宝作我的陪葬。现在你们已经知道达卡王子的历史了。我只留给你们一件纪念品。那边有一个保险箱，里面装着价值极高的金刚钻。其中大部分都是我做丈夫做父亲的时候留下的纪念品，那时候我还认为有可能玩赏呢。此外，里面还有我和我的朋友们在海底搜集到的许多珍珠。将来你们可以好好地利用这些财宝。史密斯先生，象您和您的伙伴这样的人，决不会因为手里有了钱就产生灾祸的。我‘升天’以后还要参加你们的事业，我相信你们的事业一定会有很大发展的。” 他由于过度虚弱，不得不稍息一会，然后又继续说： “明天你们把保险箱拿走，离开这间大厅，关上门。然后你们到诺第密斯号的甲板上去，把中仓口放下来，把整个的船完全关闭好。” “我们一定照办，船长。”赛勒斯·史密斯说。 “好。然后你们就上你们来的时候坐的那只小船。但是，在离开诺第留斯号以前，不要忘记做一件事：在船尾的吃水线上，有两个大旋塞。你们去把旋塞打开。海水灌进贮水槽以后，诺第留斯号就会逐渐沉到水底下去，躺在大海的深处了。” 船长看见赛勒斯·史密斯的表情，就明白了他心里在怎样想，于是加了一句： “不必害怕，你们只不过是埋葬一个尸体！” 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴都没有向尼摩船长提出任何建议。船长已经谈出了最后的心愿，他们没有别的事情可做，只等照办了。 “你们答应我了吗，诸位先生？”尼摩船长问道。 “答应您了，船长。”工程师回答说。 船长向居民们做了一个手势，表示感谢，并且要求他们暂时离开这里，让他休息几个钟头。吉丁·史佩莱打算在他身旁陪着他，以防意外，但是垂死的人拒绝了。他说，“我能够活到明天，先生。” 大家离开大厅，经过书房和餐厅，来到前面装设电动仪器的机房。这套仪器不仅能供应电热和照明用电，还能供应诺第留斯号的机械动力。 诺第留斯号本身是一个奇迹，它的内部又包含着许多奇迹。工程师看了以后，不禁诧异得说不出话来。 居民们登上平台，平台高出水面七八英尺。他们在这里看见一个大圆孔，外面嵌着一块很厚的玻璃凸透镜。亮光就是从这里射出来的。圆孔后面一看就知道是舵轮仓。当诺第留斯号在海底航行的时候，舵手就在这里面掌握方向。在航行中，电灯光一定可以照得很远。 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们默默地站了一会儿。刚才所看到的和听到的一切给他们留下深刻的印象。他们和这个多次帮助自己的保护者结识了只有几个钟头，现在他马上就要死了，想到这里，他们的心中感到非常难受。 不论后人怎样评定这个不平凡的人的一生，人们还是永远也忘不了达卡王子的形象的。 “多么了不起的人啊！”潘克洛夫说。“他真的可能是生活在海底的吗？我想他在海底所得到的宁静也不会比别处多一些。” “要是坐上诺第留斯号，”艾尔通说，“我们一定能离开林肯岛，到有人的地方去。” “我的天！”潘克洛夫叫道，“我决不冒险乘这样的船。在水面上航海，还可以；在水底下，我干不了！” “我相信，潘克洛夫，”通讯记者说，“象诺第留斯号这样的潜水船一定是很容易驾驶的。我们一定很快就能摸熟它的性能。在海底既不怕暴风雨，又不怕撞船。到海底下几英尺的地方海水就和湖里一样平静了。” “也许可能，”水手说，“但是我宁愿乘一只装备齐全的船在海上冒着狂风航行。船总是用来在海面上走的，而不是在海底下走的！” “朋友们，”工程师说，“潜水船的问题没有什么可说的，至少是用不着讨论诺第留斯号的问题。诺第留斯号不是我们的，我们没有权利去处理它。况且我们也决不能利用它。现在洞窟的出口已经被上升的玄武岩堵死了，诺第留斯号根本不可能驶出洞外去。除了这个以外，尼摩船长的愿望是要和它一起葬在海底。他的愿望就是我们的法律，我们一定要按照他的愿望去做。” 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们的谈话继续了相当长时间，然后他们下到诺第留斯号的内部。他们在那里吃了一些东西，又回到大厅里去。 在他们离开以前，尼摩船长曾经陷入虚脱状态；这时候他的精神已经恢复了。他的眼睛放射着原有的光芒。他的嘴边甚至露出一丝微笑。 居民们围在他的身旁。 “诸位先生，”船长说，“你们是既诚实又勇敢的人。你们都为公共的福利尽力。我常常观察你们的行为。过去我尊重你们——现在我仍然尊重你们！让我和您握手吧，史密斯先生！” 赛勒斯·史密斯伸出手来，船长热烈地把它握住了。 “很好！”他喃喃地说。 接着，他又继续说： “我自己的事情谈得够多的了。现在应该谈谈你们以及和你们所寄居的这个林肯岛有关的问题。你们想离开这个岛吗？” “我们也想再回来，船长！”潘克洛夫很快地说。 “再回来吗？潘克洛夫？”船长微笑着说。“真的，我知道你爱这个岛。由于你们的努力，这个岛改变了原来的面貌。你们是岛上的主人！” “船长，”赛勒斯·史密斯插嘴说，“我们打算把它合并到美国，因为它在太平洋里的位置非常有利，我们要把它开辟成一个海港。” “你们是为自己的祖国着想，先生们，”船长说，“你们为祖国的富强和荣誉而辛勤劳动。你们做得对。一个人——他应该活在祖国！死在祖国！可是我，我死的地方离我所爱的一切太远了！” “您最后还有什么心愿要我们转达，”工程师感情激动地说，“有什么纪念品要送给您遗留在印度深山里的那些朋友吗？” “没有，史密斯先生；我没有朋友了！我是我这一代的最后一个，认识我的人以为我早就死了。——还是谈你们的事吧。寂寞和孤独是可怕的，是人们不能忍受的。我曾经认为能够独自生活！……因此，你们应该想尽一切办法离开林肯岛，重新和你们的故乡见面。我知道那些匪徒把你们造的那只船撞毁了。” “我们打算造一只大船，把我们载送到最近的陆地去，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“不过，就算我们的目的达到了，我们早晚还是要回林肯岛来的。我们留恋这个地方，有许多事情回想起来使我们永远也忘不了它。” “比方说，我们就是在这里认识尼摩船长的。”赛勒斯·史密斯说。 “这里是我们唯一能够安家的地方！”赫伯特补充道。 “我要长眠在这里，如果……”船长说。 他没有把话说完，停了片刻，然后简单地说道： “史密斯先生，我想和您……单独说几句话！” 工程师的伙伴们尊重垂死的人的意见，退出去了。 赛勒斯·史密斯只和尼摩船长谈了几分钟，就又把伙伴们唤了进来。但是他没有把垂死的人吐露给他的私事告诉大家。 这时候，吉丁·史佩莱细心地看护着船长。他耗尽了全身的精力，已经不能和病体顽抗了。 这一天平安无事地过去了。居民们一刻也没有离开诺第留斯号。时间已经到了黑夜，但是在洞窟里，却是分不清黑夜白天的。 尼摩船长并不感到痛苦，他只是显著地衰退着。由于死期到来，他那高贵的面容一点血色也没有了，但他还是显得十分平静。他不时喃喃地呓语，说的都是复杂的经历中所遇到的事情。生命显然在衰退，他的四肢已经发冷了。 偶尔他还和围在旁边的居民说话，向他们露出最后的微笑，这一丝微笑，一直保持到他死后。 午夜刚过，尼摩船长竭尽全力把两臂交叉在胸前，他好象打算在死后保持这个姿势似的。 一点钟的时候，他只剩下目光还有点生气。一向炯炯有光的眼珠里现在露出了垂死的光芒。他喃喃地说着“上帝，祖国！”然后安详地死了。 赛勒斯·史密斯弯下身来，侍奉他归天。达卡王子早成了历史人物，现在连尼摩船长也成过去了。 赫伯特和潘克洛夫放声痛哭。艾尔通默默地流着泪。纳布一动也不动地跪在通讯记者旁边，象一尊雕像似的。 然后，赛勒斯·史密斯把手放在死者的头上，庄严地说： “但愿他的灵魂回到上帝身边去！为我们死去的恩人祷告吧！” 几个钟头以后，居民们实现了船长临终以前的愿望，履行了他们的诺言。 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们拿着恩人留下的唯一纪念品——装有价值亿万的财宝的保险箱，离开了诺第留斯号。 神奇的大厅里仍旧是灯火辉煌，他们小心地关上大厅的门，接着又把通上甲板的铁门严密地关起来，使海水丝毫也透不到诺第留斯号里边去。 然后移民们跳上了系在潜水船旁边的小船。 这时候，他们把小船划到诺第留斯号的船尾。船尾的吃水线附近有两个大旋塞通向贮水槽，这是为了使船下沉而装置的。 他们打开旋塞，海水灌进了贮水槽。诺第留斯号缓缓地往下沉去，最后在湖面上消失了。 居民们还能眼看着它在水里往下沉。船上发出的强烈光芒照亮了半透明的海水，洞窟逐渐黑暗下来。最后，大片的电光消失了，不一会儿，诺第留斯号——现在它已经成了尼摩船长的棺材——沉在海洋的深处了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2926.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛
