{"id":5857,"no":47,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 5","content":"So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo. Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union, he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It was under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive substance, nitro- glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same nature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat her. The \"Speedy\" had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!\\n\\n Yes! all was explained, everything--except the presence of the torpedo in the waters of the channel!\\n\\n \"My friends, then,\" said Cyrus Harding, \"we can no longer be in doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps, abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so fortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine. What his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of prodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much as we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document, who placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the situation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the island, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that torpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We have contracted a debt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.\"\\n\\n \"You are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,\" replied Gideon Spilett. \"Yes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony. I will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication with us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all our plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her first cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the dugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders him master of the elements.\"\\n\\n The reporter\u0027s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" rejoined Cyrus Harding, \"if the intervention of a human being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means of action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still, but if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The question, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your opinion on the matter?\"\\n\\n \"My opinion,\" said Pencroft, \"is that, whoever he may be, he is a brave man, and he has my esteem!\"\\n\\n \"Be it so,\" answered Harding, \"but that is not an answer, Pencroft.\"\\n\\n \"Master,\" then said Neb, \"my idea is, that we may search as long as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall not discover him till he pleases.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not bad, what you say, Neb,\" observed Pencroft.\\n\\n \"I am of Neb\u0027s opinion,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"but that is no reason for not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.\"\\n\\n \"And you, my boy, give us your opinion,\" said the engineer, turning to Herbert.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, \"how I should like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!\"\\n\\n \"Of course, my boy,\" replied Pencroft, \"so would I and all of us. I am not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual face to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong, with a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on clouds, a great ball in his hands!\"\\n\\n \"But, Pencroft,\" answered Spilett, \"you are describing a picture of the Creator.\"\\n\\n \"Possibly, Mr. Spilett,\" replied the sailor, \"but that is how I imagine him!\"\\n\\n \"And you, Ayrton?\" asked the engineer.\\n\\n \"Captain Harding,\" replied Ayrton, \"I can give you no better advice in this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you in your researches, I am ready to follow you.\\n\\n \"I thank you, Ayrton,\" answered Cyrus Harding, \"but I should like a more direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important decision. Speak, therefore.\"\\n\\n \"Captain Harding,\" replied Ayrton, \"I think that we ought to do everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone. Perhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too, as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be only he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a man again. No, I will never forget him!\"\\n\\n \"That is settled, then,\" said Cyrus Harding. \"We will begin our researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island unexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses, and will hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our intentions!\"\\n\\n For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work finished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all the treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there, methodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as much from animals as from man.\\n\\n There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite. Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare utensils--in a word, all the stores of the colony.\\n\\n As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of ordnance, which, at Pencroft\u0027s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.\\n\\n \"Captain,\" said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, \"now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried the range of our guns.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that is useful?\" asked the engineer.\\n\\n \"It is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided?\"\\n\\n \"Try them, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer. \"However, I think that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which will never fail us.\"\\n\\n \"Can the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?\" asked the reporter, who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite House.\\n\\n \"I believe so. However,\" added the engineer, \"we will be prudent.\" The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make. Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be able to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range. In fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity.\\n\\n \"Now,\" said Harding to his companions, \"the initial velocity is in proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent results.\"\\n\\n \"We shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!\" answered Pencroft.\\n\\n It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order. Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States Navy.\\n\\n On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony, including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried. They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.\\n\\n Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.\\n\\n At Harding\u0027s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet, fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude.\\n\\n The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear boy.\\n\\n The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.\\n\\n For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so as to try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its bursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord.\\n\\n A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the colonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf.\\n\\n \"Well, captain,\" exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the reports themselves, \"what do you say of our battery? All the pirates in the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not one can land there now without our permission!\"\\n\\n \"Believe me, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer, \"it would be better not to have to make the experiment.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said the sailor, \"what ought to be done with regard to those six villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them to overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are regular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such! What do you think, Ayrton?\" added Pencroft, turning to his companion.\\n\\n Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that Pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved when Ayrton replied in a humble tone,--\\n\\n \"I have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to speak.\"\\n\\n And with a slow step he walked away.\\n\\n Pencroft understood.\\n\\n \"What a brute I am!\" he exclaimed. \"Poor Ayrton! He has as much right to speak here as any one!\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Gideon Spilett, \"but his reserve does him honor, and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.\"\\n\\n \"Certainly, Mr. Spilett,\" answered the sailor, \"and there is no fear of my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island of them as soon as possible.\"\\n\\n \"Is that your opinion, Pencroft?\" asked the engineer.\\n\\n \"Quite my opinion.\"\\n\\n \"And before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had committed some fresh act of hostility against us?\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t what they have done already enough?\" asked Pencroft, who did not understand these scruples.\\n\\n \"They may adopt other sentiments!\" said Harding, \"and perhaps repent.\"\\n\\n \"They repent!\" exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.\\n\\n \"Pencroft, think of Ayrton!\" said Herbert, taking the sailor\u0027s hand. \"He became an honest man again!\"\\n\\n Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had landed on the island with Bob Harvey\u0027s accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the \"Speedy,\" and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.\\n\\n \"Come!\" said be. \"Everybody is against me! You wish to be generous to those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn\u0027t repent it!\"\\n\\n \"What danger shall we run,\" said Herbert, \"if we take care to be always on our guard?\"\\n\\n \"Hum!\" observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion. \"They are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!\"\\n\\n \"Why have they not done so?\" said Herbert. \"No doubt because it was not their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.\"\\n\\n \"Well, well!\" replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced. \"Let us leave these good people to do what they like, and don\u0027t think anything more about them!\"\\n\\n \"Come, Pencroft,\" said Neb, \"don\u0027t make yourself out so bad as all that! Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good range of your guns, you would not fire.\"\\n\\n \"I would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,\" replied Pencroft coldly.\\n\\n \"Pencroft,\" said the engineer, \"you have always shown much deference to my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?\"\\n\\n \"I will do as you please, Captain Harding,\" answered the sailor, who was not at all convinced.\\n\\n \"Very well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked first.\"\\n\\n Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although Pencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but were to be on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile. If any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts, these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At any rate, for humanity\u0027s sake alone, it would be right to wait. The colonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without fear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their island. It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on their side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That remained to be seen.\\n\\n 于是，水雷在海底爆炸把一切疑问都解释清楚了。赛勒斯·史密斯是决不会错的，因为在南北战争中，他曾经试制过这种可怕的爆炸武器。这个铁筒里装着炸药——硝化甘油、苦味酸或其他类似的药品，就是在它的作用下，海峡里的潮水才掀成一个圆顶，船底才炸裂，以致立刻下沉，由于船身被破坏得非常严重，因此一沉下去就没法再浮起来了。装甲舰碰到这种水雷，也会象渔船似的毫不困难地被炸毁，飞快号碰上以后，当然更经受不起了！\\n\\n 是的！一切都真相大白了，现在只剩下一个问题——海峡里的水雷是怎么来的？\\n\\n “因此，朋友们，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我们现在不用再怀疑了，这里一定有一个神秘的人，也许和我们一样，他也是遇难以后，被遗弃在荒岛上的；我所以要这么说，是要让艾尔通也知道知道两年来我们所遇到的种种怪事。虽然我们有好几次得到他的帮助，我还是没法想象，这个陌生的恩人是谁。他屡次暗中帮助我们，究竟有什么目的，我也不知道。可是他确确实实是在帮助我们；并且根据性质来看，只有具备惊人才干的人，才能这样做。艾尔通和我们同样受到他的恩惠，因为当我从气球上掉下的时候，如果是他把我从海里救起来的；那么写那张纸条，把瓶子放在海峡里，让我们知道我们的伙伴所在的地方的，也一定就是这个陌生人。我还要补充一些事实：引着那只箱子，把它放在遗物角，使我们得到一切必需品的是他；在荒岛的高地上燃起篝火，使你们能够找到陆地的也是他，在西瑞身上打了一枪的是他；在海峡里布置水雷，炸毁双桅船的，也是他；一句话，所有那些我们不能解释的怪事，都是这个神秘的人做的。因此，不管他是谁，是遇难的人也好，是流放在我们岛上的人也好，我们都应该感激他；要不然，我们就成了忘恩负义的人了。我们欠下了这笔人情债，希望有一天我们能够还清它。”\\n\\n “你说得对，亲爱的赛勒斯，”吉丁·史佩莱说。“不错，岛上藏着一个可以说是万能的人。他的力量对我们有莫大的好处。我还要补充一点，就是如果我们承认在实际生活中有超凡的事情，那么，这个陌生人的本领简直就近乎超凡入圣了。是不是他暗中从‘花岗石宫’的井里探听我们的消息，因此掌握了我们的全盘计划呢？是不是他在我们第一次试航的时候，把瓶子扔给我们的呢？是不是他把托普从湖里扔出来，刺死儒艮的呢？是不是他把你从海里救起来的呢？以当时发生这些事的情况来说，是谁也干不了的，这种种事实，使我们不由得要这样想：如果这些事情都是一个人干的。那么他简直有呼风唤雨的能力了。”\\n\\n 通讯记者的论点很正确，人人都有同感。\\n\\n “是的，”赛勒斯·史密斯接着说，“如果可以肯定给我们解围的是一个人，我同意他具有一般人所没有的本领。现在这还是一个谜，可是如果能找到这个人，这个谜就可以解决了。因此，现在的问题是，我们究竟应该尊重这个仁慈的人，随他隐藏着不去惊动他，还是尽量把他找出来呢？你们对这个问题有什么意见？”\\n\\n “我的意见是，”潘克洛夫说，“不管他是谁，他都是一个勇敢的人，我很佩服他！”\\n\\n “话虽不错，”史密斯说，“可是我问的不是这个，潘克洛夫。”\\n\\n “主人，”纳布说，“我的意见是，我们可以尽量找你说的那个人；可是我想，他如果不愿意露面，那我们是找不到他的。”\\n\\n “你说得不错，纳布。”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n “我也同意纳布的意见，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可是我们却不能因此就不探险了。不管我们能不能找到这个神秘的人。我们至少应该尽到找他的心意。”\\n\\n “你呢，孩子，谈谈你的意见吧。”工程师对赫伯特说。\\n\\n “呵，”赫伯特兴奋地说，“他先救了你，现在又救了我们大家，我真想谢谢他！”\\n\\n “当然，孩子，”潘克洛夫说，“我们每一个人都想谢他。我向来是不爱追根问底的，可是要能够面对面看他一眼，挖我一只眼睛我也甘心情愿！我想这个人一定长得很英俊，高高的个子，身体魁梧，留着漂亮的胡子，亮光光的头发；还有，他一定是坐在云彩上，手里托着一个大地球！”\\n\\n “潘克洛夫，”史佩莱说，“你说的是全能的造物主的形象呀。”\\n\\n “也许是的，史佩莱先生，”水手答道，“不过，我想象中他就是那样的！”\\n\\n “你呢，艾尔通？”工程师问道。\\n\\n “史密斯先生，”艾尔通回答说，“在这个问题上我想不出更好的意见了。你所采取的办法就是最好的办法。如果你要我和你们一起去搜查的话，我随时都准备跟你们去。”\\n\\n “谢谢你，艾尔通，”赛勒斯·史密斯答道，“可是我希望你能回答我的问题，怎么想的就怎么说。你是我们的伙伴，你已经为我们冒过好几次生命危险了。我们在作出任何一项重要决定的时候，都应该和其他人一样，也和你商量。所以，你还是说说你的意见吧。”\\n\\n “史密斯先生，”艾尔通说，“我认为我们应该尽一切力量把这个陌生的恩人找出来。也许他是孤单单的一个人。也许他在受着苦难。也许他需要换一种新的生活。你们说得对，我也应该还他的人情。一定是他，而且只能是他曾经到达抱岛去过，他在那里发现了你们知道的那个可怜人，并且让你们知道，有一个不幸的人在那里等待着你们去援救！因此，多亏了他，我才重新变成人。不能，我永远也不能忘记他！”\\n\\n “那么，就这样决定了，”赛勒斯·史密斯说。“我们要尽早开始搜查。这一次对于荒岛的任何一个角落都不能放过。我们连最隐蔽的地方也要搜索，希望这位陌生的朋友能考虑到我们的用意，原谅我们！”\\n\\n 几天以来，移民们积极地整理干草，进行田间收割。他们打算先把一切能做完的工作尽量做好，然后再去实现他们的计划——探索荒岛上还没有到过的地方。从达抱岛移植过来的各种蔬菜，现在也到了该收获的时候。一切都收拾好了，好在“花岗石宫”里有的是地方，把岛上的全部物资运来都装得下。小队收获下来的东西井井有条地藏在那里。可以想象，存放的地方非常安全，既不怕动物糟蹋，又不怕歹人劫掠。\\n\\n 隔着厚实的花岗石壁，完全不必担心受潮。居民们利用鹤嘴锄和火药，把上甬道的许多天然石洞都扩大了，因此，“花岗石宫”成了一个综合仓库，里面放着全部的粮食、武器、工具和不用的器皿——一句话，整个小队的物资全放在里面了。\\n\\n 从双桅船上得来的炮是优良的武器，在潘克洛夫的要求下，终于用绳索和辘轳把它们吊到“花岗石宫”里来。他们在窗洞之间凿了几个炮眼，不久以后，就可以在花岗石壁上看见光亮的炮口了。他们在这么高的地方，可以俯瞰整个的联合湾。这里好比是一个小小的直布罗陀，任何船舶，只要在小岛附近抛锚，就一定要暴露在这座高空炮台的射程之内。\\n\\n “史密斯先生，”11月8日那天，潘克洛夫说，“现在我们的炮台已经筑好了，不妨试试大炮的射程。”\\n\\n “你认为这样做有用吗？”工程师问道。\\n\\n “不但有用，而且有必要！要不然，怎么知道我们那些刮刮叫的炮弹能射多远呢？”\\n\\n “试吧，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道。“可是，我想还是把普通火药原封不动地留着不要用，在试验的时候用棉花火药，因为棉花火药是用不完的。”\\n\\n “大炮经得住棉花火药的爆炸吗？”通讯记者问道，他也和潘克洛夫一样，急于试一试“花岗石宫”里的大炮。\\n\\n “我想是经得住的。”工程师说，“但我们应该谨慎一些。”\\n\\n 工程师想得不错，大炮钢质十分优良。这是用锻钢铸造的一种后膛炮，按理可以装填大量的火药，射得很远。事实上，要想取得实际效果，弹道就必须尽量低伸，而要想得到这种力量，就必须有极大的初速，推动炮弹前进。\\n\\n “初速跟火药的多少是成正比的。”史密斯对伙伴们说，“在制造这种大炮的时候，一切都要由所用的金属是不是具有最高度的抵抗力来决定，钢，无疑的是抵抗力最大的金属。因此，我完全有理由相信，我们的炮可以安全地经受爆炸气体的膨胀，试射效果肯定是良好的。”\\n\\n “等我们试过以后，就更可以肯定了！”潘克洛夫说。\\n\\n 不用说，四门大炮收拾得就跟新的一样。自从打水里捞起来以后，水手在它们身上花了不少气力。他用了许多时间去磨光、上油、擦亮和拆洗零件！现在它们亮得和美国海军巡洋舰上的大炮一样。\\n\\n 于是，这一天，四门大炮就在全体居民——包括杰普和托普——面前按次序试放了。前面已经说过，棉花火药的爆炸威力相当于普通火药的四倍，他们考虑到这一点，然后给大炮装上适当量的棉花火药。炮弹是圆锥筒形的。\\n\\n 潘克洛夫站在那里，抓住拉火绳的末端，随时准备发射。\\n\\n 史密斯把手一挥，他就开炮了。炮弹飞过小岛，一直掉在海里，距离没法精确估计。\\n\\n 第二炮瞄准遗物角尽头的岩石，炮弹打在一块离“花岗石宫”几乎有三英里的尖石头上，炸得碎石乱飞。这一炮是赫伯特瞄准了发射的，他对自己的第一炮感到非常骄傲。可是潘克洛夫却比他还要骄傲得多！因为这一炮打得这么漂亮，而荣誉又属于他亲爱的孩子。\\n\\n 第三炮对着联合湾南边的沙丘，一炮射去，打在四英里以外的沙地上，然后炮弹又蹦起来落在海里，溅起一片水花。\\n\\n 在放第四炮的时候，赛勒斯·史密斯稍微多加了一些火药，打算看看最多能射多远。由于怕发生爆炸，大家都站得很远，然后用一根长绳子拉火。\\n\\n 一声惊人的巨响过后，移民们立刻跑到窗口去，大炮的效果很好，只见炮弹在离“花岗石宫”将近五英里的颚骨角擦过岩石．掉在鲨鱼湾里了。\\n\\n “好哇，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫叫道，他的欢呼声简直和炮声不相上下，“你看我们的炮台怎么样？太平洋上的海盗全到‘花岗石宫’前面来都不要紧！如果没有得到我们许可，谁也不要想登陆！”\\n\\n “信不信由你，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“这样的试验还是不做的好。”\\n\\n “嗯？”水手说，“那么应该怎样对付还在岛上游荡的那六个坏蛋呢？难道让他们糟蹋我们的森林、田地和农场吗？这些强盗是不折不扣的美洲豹，我认为我们必须毫不犹豫地用炮火对付他们！你说呢，艾尔通？”潘克洛夫对他的伙伴说。\\n\\n 艾尔通犹豫了一下，没有立刻回答，赛勒斯·史密斯对潘克洛夫冒冒失失地提出这个问题感到非常遗憾。尤其使他感动的是，艾尔通竟这样自卑地说：\\n\\n “我也曾经是一只美洲豹，潘克洛夫先生。我没有权利发言。”\\n\\n 于是他慢慢地走开了。\\n\\n 潘克洛夫这才明白过来。\\n\\n “我真不是个人！”他大声说。“可怜的艾尔通！在这里，他和大家一样，有他的发言权！”\\n\\n “是的，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“可是他愈沉默，我们愈应该看重他，我们应该尊重他追悔往事的心情。”\\n\\n “当然，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“你不必操心，我再也不会这样做了。我宁可咬掉自己的舌头，也不愿意使艾尔通伤心！现在把话说回来。我觉得对待那些强盗就应该老实不客气，我们必须赶快把他们从岛上消灭掉。”\\n\\n “这是你的意见吗，潘克洛夫？”工程师问道。\\n\\n “一点儿也不错。”\\n\\n “在他们对我们还没有什么新的敌对行动以前，你就打算毫不留清地去追捕他们吗？”\\n\\n “他们已经做的难道还不够吗？”潘克洛夫问道，他不懂得仔细考虑。\\n\\n “也许他们会改变心情的！”史密斯说，“也许他们会悔过。”\\n\\n “他们会海过！”水手耸耸肩叫道。\\n\\n “潘克洛夫，你想想艾尔通吧！”赫伯特拉着水手的手说。“他已经改邪归正了！”\\n\\n 潘克洛夫挨着个地看着他的伙伴。他万万没有想到他的意见会遭到反对。这些流氓是跟鲍勃·哈维的狐群狗党一起到岛上来的。他们是屠杀飞快号全体船员的凶手；潘克洛夫把他们看作是一群野兽，必须毫不迟疑毫不留情地把他们消灭掉；他秉性直率，因此认为不能和这帮人打交道。\\n\\n “好吧！”他说。“人人都反对我！你们打算饶了这帮匪徒！很好，但愿我们没有后悔的时候！”\\n\\n “只要我们随时警惕，”赫伯特说，“有什么危险呢？”\\n\\n “哼！”通讯记者说，他还没有表明过自己的主张。“他们是六个全副武装的人。要是各自躲在一个角落里，向我们每人放一枪，他们马上就可以成为岛上的主人了！”\\n\\n “他们为什么没有这样做呢？”赫伯特说。“因为他们不打算这样做，这是很明显的。再说，我们也是六个人。”\\n\\n “好吧，好吧！”潘克洛夫说，他是没有法子说服的。“让这些好人爱干什么就干什么去吧，也不必去为他们操心了！”\\n\\n “潘克洛夫，”纳布说，“不要让你自己当恶人！要是有一个不幸的人站在你的面前，在你的射程之内，你也不会开枪的。”\\n\\n “我会象打疯狗似的一枪把他打死，纳布。”潘克洛夫冷冷地说。\\n\\n “潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“你一向是听我话的；在这个问题上，你能听我的话吗？”\\n\\n “我可以按照你的意思去做，史密斯先生。”水手说，可是他丝毫也没有改变他的看法。\\n\\n “很好，那么，除非他们先向我们进攻，要不然我们决不攻击他们。”\\n\\n 虽然潘克洛夫算计着这样做完全没有好处、可是大家就这样通过对海盗采取的行动了。他们不打算进攻，只准备防守。荒岛地面很大，而且土地肥沃。如果这些坏人还有一些良心，他们就可能改邪归正。他们不想在这种环境里开始新生吗？不管怎么样，根据人道主义的要求，这样等待他们还是必要的。移民们不能象以前那样毫无顾虑地走来走去了。以前只要提防野兽就行了，现在却有六个罪犯出没在荒岛上，也许他们还是一些极坏的人。情况的确是严重的。而且对胆子小一些的人来说，等于失去了安全的保障！当然，目前移民们有理由反对潘克洛夫的看法，可以认为不要紧。将来这种看法是不是对呢？只好等以后再证实了。\\n\\n
