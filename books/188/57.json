{"id":5867,"no":57,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 15","content":"The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.\\n\\n The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer heaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be foreseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption, it was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from it. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island had already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava hardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape of the crater--the opening broken in the upper edge--the matter would be thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.\\n\\n However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at the summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open. This had occurred in the two hemispheres--at Etna, Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared. In fact, an earthquake--a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic eruption--is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain, and to open new outlets for the burning lava.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons. After all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater open in the southern side of Mount Franklin.\\n\\n From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain, and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central crater.\\n\\n However, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall on the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill, which rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The mechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of wood, a second vertical movement to move the saw--this was all that was wanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders, and pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September the skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay in the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the timbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the vessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very slender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a considerable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig had been saved after the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity of copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the carpenters had much to do.\\n\\n Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking, and the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night came the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any time they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve o\u0027clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then ascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.\\n\\n Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting subject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then spoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage in the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation. But always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this colony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which a communication with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to end their days there.\\n\\n \"Herbert,\" said the sailor, \"you will never abandon Lincoln Island?\"\\n\\n \"Never, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay there.\"\\n\\n \"That was made up long ago, my boy,\" answered Pencroft. \"I shall expect you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly chaps of your youngsters!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s agreed,\" replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time.\\n\\n \"And you, Captain Harding,\" resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, \"you will be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it support? Ten thousand at least!\"\\n\\n They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the reporter actually started a newspaper--the New Lincoln Herald!\\n\\n So is man\u0027s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and this it is which justifies it, over all the world.\\n\\n After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little dream of the future.\\n\\n Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan again and show himself to all restored.\\n\\n One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged later than usual. It was nine o\u0027clock. Already, long badly concealed yawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding towards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room, suddenly rang.\\n\\n All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton, Pencroft, Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely believing their ears.\\n\\n \"What does that mean?\" cried Neb. \"Was it the devil who rang it?\"\\n\\n No one answered.\\n\\n \"The weather is stormy,\" observed Herbert. \"Might not its influence of electricity--\"\\n\\n Herbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes were turned, shook his head negatively.\\n\\n \"We must wait,\" said Gideon Spilett. \"If it is a signal, whoever it may be who has made it, he will renew it.\"\\n\\n \"But who do you think it is?\" cried Neb.\\n\\n \"Who?\" answered Pencroft, \"but he--\"\\n\\n The sailor\u0027s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.\\n\\n Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:--\\n\\n \"What do you want?\"\\n\\n A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this reply to the tenants of Granite House:--\\n\\n \"Come to the corral immediately.\"\\n\\n \"At last!\" exclaimed Harding.\\n\\n Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists\u0027 fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without having uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They could do without them.\\n\\n The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as the sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.\\n\\n It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the island itself. The night was very threatening.\\n\\n But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from finding the familiar road to the corral.\\n\\n They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.\\n\\n They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was no doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply concerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful in his action! Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said in Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of time?\\n\\n Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds, influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.\\n\\n During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by this remark from Pencroft:--\\n\\n \"We ought to have brought a torch.\"\\n\\n And by this reply from the engineer:--\\n\\n \"We shall find one at the corral.\"\\n\\n Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.\\n\\n At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently the storm would not be long in bursting forth.\\n\\n The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.\\n\\n The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible force.\\n\\n At ten o\u0027clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.\\n\\n In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.\\n\\n Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from thence that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through the window.\\n\\n The engineer knocked at the door.\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which was perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.\\n\\n There was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been left.\\n\\n \"Have we been deceived by an illusion?\" murmured Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n No! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,--\\n\\n \"Come to the corral immediately.\"\\n\\n They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire. Everything was in order--the pile on the box containing it, as well as all the apparatus.\\n\\n \"Who came here the last time?\" asked the engineer.\\n\\n \"I did, captain,\" answered Ayrton.\\n\\n \"And that was--\"\\n\\n \"Four days ago.\"\\n\\n \"Ah! a note!\" cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.\\n\\n On this paper were written these words in English:--\\n\\n \"Follow the new wire.\"\\n\\n \"Forward!\" cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating directly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to the old one.\\n\\n Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm then burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each lightning- flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit of the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional flashes.\\n\\n There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the isolator to the ground.\\n\\n \"There it is!\" said he.\\n\\n This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission of the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern spurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.\\n\\n \"Follow it!\" said Cyrus Harding.\\n\\n And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.\\n\\n The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get forward as fast as possible.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its narrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The engineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and that the stranger\u0027s retreat would be there.\\n\\n Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur, and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild basalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and felt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the wire was running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.\\n\\n The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there as if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the colonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west. The wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.\\n\\n Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.\\n\\n At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side of a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning a fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea. The descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the danger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws iron.\\n\\n Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in broad daylight would have been considered impracticable.\\n\\n The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the gleams of light. Harding was first--Ayrton last. On they went, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled on.\\n\\n At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had reached the bottom of the basalt cliff.\\n\\n There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the sea.\\n\\n The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves.\\n\\n His companions were stupefied.\\n\\n A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must they then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine cavern? In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.\\n\\n The engineer stopped them.\\n\\n He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there--\\n\\n \"We must wait,\" said he. \"The tide is high. At low water the way will be open.\"\\n\\n \"But what can make you think-\" asked Pencroft.\\n\\n \"He would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us to reach him!\"\\n\\n Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.\\n\\n There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching in a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was re- echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.\\n\\n The colonists\u0027 emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman apparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of the mysterious genius of the island.\\n\\n At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to reconnoiter.\\n\\n The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle, entered the yawning gulf.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,--\\n\\n \"In an hour the opening will be practicable.\"\\n\\n \"It is there, then?\" said Pencroft.\\n\\n \"Did you doubt it?\" returned Harding.\\n\\n \"But this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,\" observed Herbert.\\n\\n \"Either the cavern will be completely dry,\" replied Harding, \"and in that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some means of transport will be put at our disposal.\"\\n\\n An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was like the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.\\n\\n Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the water. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior projection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the bottom.\\n\\n \"Jump in!\" said Harding.\\n\\n In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern, lighted the way.\\n\\n The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly rose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too slight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to be ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a sound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce its thick sides.\\n\\n Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts dating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the sea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal\u0027s Cave, in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth caverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in length! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns, and preserved them for the admiration of man.\\n\\n Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in short sentences, when all at once,--\\n\\n \"More to the right!\" he commanded.\\n\\n The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.\\n\\n The wire was there fastened to the rock.\\n\\n \"Forward!\" said Harding.\\n\\n And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.\\n\\n On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half-a- mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding\u0027s voice was again heard.\\n\\n \"Stop!\" said he.\\n\\n The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.\\n\\n At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls with light.\\n\\n By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the projections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave, and it filled it entirely.\\n\\n At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water, causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards the light, which was now not more than half a cable\u0027s length distant.\\n\\n At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350 feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic wall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here considerably, the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if the light issued from them.\\n\\n In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat. This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water.\\n\\n The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He gazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the reporter\u0027s arm,--\\n\\n \"It is he! It can only be he!\" he cried, \"he!--\"\\n\\n Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett alone could hear.\\n\\n The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,--\\n\\n \"He! an outlawed man!\"\\n\\n \"He!\" said Harding.\\n\\n At the engineer\u0027s command the boat approached this singular floating apparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of light through a thick glass.\\n\\n Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was there. All darted down the opening.\\n\\n At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the end of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.\\n\\n A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.\\n\\n At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the engineer.\\n\\n An immense saloon--a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry-- appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment.\\n\\n Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice their presence.\\n\\n Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his companions, he uttered these words,--\\n\\n \"Captain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.--\"\\n\\n 居民们听了工程师的紧急通知，放下工作，默默地注视着富兰克林山的顶峰。\\n\\n 火山复活了。蒸汽透过火山口底下积累的矿石岩层升了起来。但是，地下火会不会引起猛烈的爆炸呢？这是很难预料的。不过，就算火山可能爆发，也不见得整个的林肯岛都会遭殃。火山里流出来的岩浆并不一定会造成灾祸，朝北的山坡上有一条条凝结的熔岩，从这里可以看出，荒岛已经遭受过这种考验了。并且，根据火山口的形状——它的缺口是开在上面的边缘部分的——还可以断定，岩浆多半要喷在富饶地区对面的那部分荒岛上。\\n\\n 但是，过去的情况却不一定能够回答将来的问题。在火山的顶峰，往往是把原有的火山口堵塞了，又钻出一个新的火山口来。这种情形在南半球和北半球都曾经有过，例如埃得纳火山、波波卡提佩特峰和奥里萨巴火山就是这样的。在爆炸的前夕，任何情形都可能发生。事实上，常常随着火山爆发而发生地震，这就能够改变火山的内部结构，给岩浆打开一条新的出路。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯向伙伴们解释了这些事情。他毫不夸大地向大家说明了正反两种可能性。总之，他们是没法阻止的。同时也应该说明，除非发生地震，动摇了地面，要不然“花岗石宫”大概是不会遭到危险的。但是，如果从富兰克林山的南边开出一个新的火山口来，畜栏就要遭到严重的威胁了。\\n\\n 从这一天起，山顶的烟就一直没有消失；而且可以看出，虽然其中没有夹带火焰，喷出来的烟却愈来愈高、愈来愈浓了。尤其是中央火山口较低的地方，喷出来的烟更浓。\\n\\n 不管怎么样，随着季节的转暖，工作又继续干起来了。造船的工作在尽快地进行。赛勒斯·史密斯利用岸上的瀑布，建立了一个水力锯木场；这么一来，树干很快就锯成铺板和托架了。这套机械装置和挪威乡村锯木场里所用的同样简单。先用一个水平的机械装置转动木块，再用另一个垂直机械装置转动钢锯，这就是全部的必要器材了。工程师用一个车轮，两个滚筒，和几个滑车，把它顺利地装配起来。九月底，在造船所里未来的纵帆船的骨架已经形成了。肋材也已经差不多完工，全部船骨暂时由箍条缚着，船的轮廓大致可以看得出来了。这只纵帆船船头很尖，后半部又细又长，一定是非常适合远航的。但是铺板工程还需要一段相当长的时间才能完成。幸而在海盗的双桅船爆炸以后，他们把船上的铁制品都保留下来了。潘克洛夫和艾尔通从铺板和损坏了的肋材上拔下一些螺丝钉和许多铜钉来，这就可以少做多少铁活；但是木工活却做也做不完。\\n\\n 为了在高地上进行收割、堆积干草和收获各种农作物，造船的工程停止了一个星期。农忙完毕，全部时间又都投入了安装纵帆船的工作。一到晚上，工人们真是筋疲力尽。为了不浪费一分一秒的时间，他们改变了吃饭的钟点；十二点钟吃午饭，直到天黑以后才吃晚饭。吃完以后就上“花岗石宫”去，立刻睡觉。\\n\\n 有时候他们谈起一些有趣的问题，也会延迟睡觉的时间。在这种情况下居民们谈到将来。要是乘纵帆船到有人居住的陆地去，是可能改变他们的环境的；于是他们愉快地谈起那时候将有哪些变化。但是，在谈论这些计划的时候，总有一种思想占着上风，那就是：以后他们还要回到林肯岛来。这块领地是他们用无数的劳力胜利地开拓出来的，一旦和美国取得联系，就可以得到新的动力，因此，他们决不放弃它。尤其是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们希望在林肯岛上过一辈子。\\n\\n “赫伯特，”水手说，“你永远也不会离开林肯岛的，是不是？”\\n\\n “是的，潘克洛夫，特别是假如你打定主意要留在这里，我更不会离开它了。”\\n\\n “我早就打定主意了，孩子，”潘克洛夫说。“我在这里等你。你把你的妻子和小孩带到这儿来，我要把你的孩子教育成活泼天真的小家伙！”\\n\\n “就这样吧。”赫伯特红着脸笑道。\\n\\n “还有你，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫满腔热诚地接着说，“你永远是岛上的领袖！啊！岛上能够养活多少人呢？至少一万人！”\\n\\n 他们就这样谈笑，让潘克洛夫滔滔不绝地往下说。最后，根据他们的理想，通讯记者真的办了一种报纸——《林肯岛先驱新报》！\\n\\n 人的心情就是这样的。人类所以能成为万物之灵，就是因为有一种愿望：从事一种永垂不朽的事业，这种事业在他本人死了以后，还能够万古长存。正是由于这种信念，人类才树立了自己的权威，才毫无愧色地成为世界的主人！\\n\\n 除了这些以外，谁知道杰普和托普对它们的未来是不是怀着理想呢？\\n\\n 艾尔通暗暗地对自己说，希望能够重新看见格里那凡爵士，让他知道，自己已经改过自新了。\\n\\n 10月15日晚上，谈话时间拖得比平时要长一些。已经九点钟了。尽管大家都不想去睡觉，但还是忍不住打出长长的呵欠来，说明现在是休息的时候了。潘克洛夫正向床边走去，餐厅里的电报铃突然响了起来。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特、艾尔通、潘克洛夫、纳布，人人都在场。居民们谁也没有到畜栏去。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯站起来了。伙伴们你看着我，我看着你，几乎不相信自己的耳朵。\\n\\n “这是怎么回事？”纳布叫道。“是魔鬼在打铃吗？”\\n\\n 没有人回答。\\n\\n “在这暴风雨的天气，”赫伯特说。“会不会是电流的感应……”\\n\\n 赫伯特的话没有说完。大家都注视着工程师，只见他否定地摇摇头。\\n\\n “等一会儿，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“如果是信号，不管是谁，他一定会接着再发的。”\\n\\n “可是你认为那是谁呢？”纳布大声问道。\\n\\n “谁？”潘克洛夫回答说，“除了他……”\\n\\n 又是一声铃响，把水手的话打断了。\\n\\n 史密斯走到电报机旁边，向畜栏发出一个问题：\\n\\n “你要什么？”\\n\\n 不一会儿，指针在字码表上给“花岗石宫”的居民们作了一个回答：\\n\\n “立刻到畜栏来。”\\n\\n “总算有答案了！”史密斯大声说。\\n\\n 是的！总算有答案了！现在秘密快要揭穿了。在一种强烈的兴趣鼓舞下，居民们的疲劳已经忘得干干净净。这种兴趣催促着他们到畜栏去，把他们休息的念头完全打消了。他们一句话也没有说，很快就离开了“花岗石宫”，来到海滩上。只有杰普和托普留在家里，他们这次不需要它们陪着去了。\\n\\n 夜色非常昏暗。新月已经和太阳一起西沉。正如赫伯特刚才所说的，黑压压的阴云象穹窿似的低罩在头上，遮盖得不透一点星光。远处暴风雨中划着几道闪电，照亮了水平线。\\n\\n 也许在几个钟头以后，岛上就要到处都是一片雷声了。这一晚天气非常险恶。\\n\\n 但是，不管天色多么昏暗，他们还是能找到熟悉的畜栏路的。\\n\\n 他们爬上慈悲河的左岸，来到高地，过了甘油河上的吊桥，走上穿过森林的大道。\\n\\n 他们的步伐很快，人人都不能抑制自己的兴奋心情。毫无疑问，现在他们很快就要知道这个猜了很久的哑谜的答案了！这个答案也就是那个神秘的人的名字；他和居民们的生活有着多么大的关系，为他们效劳的时候是多么慷慨，他是多么神通广大啊！要是这个陌生人没有和他们共处在一起，不知道他们的日常琐事，没有听到过“花岗石宫”里的每一句谈话，他怎么能总是在紧要关头来帮助他们呢？\\n\\n 人人都怀着心事，快步往前走去，在树枝搭成的拱门底下，一片漆黑，看不见哪里是路边。森林里鸦雀无声。在这种气压较低的情况下，飞禽走兽都静悄悄的，一动也不动。连一丝吹动树叶的微风也没有。只听见居民们的脚步在封冻的地面上发出回响。\\n\\n 走了一刻钟，潘克洛夫打破了周围的寂静：\\n\\n “我们应该带一个火把。”\\n\\n 工程师回答他说：\\n\\n “我们可以在畜栏里找到火把的。”\\n\\n 史密斯和他的伙伴们离开“花岗石宫”的时候是九点十二分。慈悲河距畜栏五英里，九点四十七分的时候，他们走了三英里。\\n\\n 这时候，闪电照亮了黑暗的森林，也照亮了整个的海岛。电光闪烁，使得他们几乎睁不开眼睛。显然，暴风雨就要来临。\\n\\n 闪电愈来愈亮，而且愈来愈频繁。远处的雷声在空中隆隆地响着。空气非常沉闷。\\n\\n 居民们好象有一种不可抗拒的力量推动着，急忙忙地赶路。\\n\\n 十点钟的时候，一道耀眼的闪电照亮了畜栏的栅栏。当他们走到门口的时候，霹雳般的雷声就响起来了。\\n\\n 不一会儿，史密斯就带领着大家，穿过畜栏，来到房屋的门前。\\n\\n 电报是从畜栏里发出的，因此陌生人大概就在屋子里。但是，窗户上却没有透出灯光来。\\n\\n 工程师敲了一下门。\\n\\n 没有回答。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯把门打开，居民们走进了屋子。屋里一片漆黑。纳布划了一根火柴，不一会就点着了灯，灯光照亮了房里的每个角落。\\n\\n 屋子里一个人也没有。一切都和他们上次离开这里的时候一样。\\n\\n “我们是被错觉迷惑了吗？”赛勒斯·史密斯喃喃地说。\\n\\n 不！这是不可能的！电报清清楚楚地指出：\\n\\n “立刻到畜栏来。”\\n\\n 他们走到专放电报机的桌子旁边。一切都照常，电池还是好好的装在匣子里，电报机也保持着原来的样子。\\n\\n “谁最后到这儿来的？”工程师问道。\\n\\n “是我，史密斯先生。”艾尔通回答说。\\n\\n “那是在……”\\n\\n “四天以前。”\\n\\n “啊！一张通知！”赫伯特指着桌上的一张纸条，大声叫道。\\n\\n 纸上用英文写着：\\n\\n 沿着新电线一直走。\\n\\n “走吧！”史密斯大声说。他已经明白了，电报不是从畜栏里发出，而是通过一根附加在旧线上的电线，从神秘的住处直接打给“花岗石宫”的。\\n\\n 纳布拿起点着的灯，大家离开了畜栏。这时候暴风雨的来势凶猛。闪电过后，紧接着就是雷声。在闪光中，不时可以看见烟雾缭绕的火山顶。\\n\\n 在畜栏的房屋和栅栏之间到处都找不到电报线。工程师跑到第一根电线杆旁边，在电光的照耀下，只见绝缘物上有一根新线一直拖到地面上。\\n\\n “有了！”他说。\\n\\n 这根电线拖在地上，象海底电缆似的，外面包着一层绝缘物体，保护电流在里面自由通过。它好象穿过森林和富兰克林山的南部支脉，一直往西拉去。\\n\\n “跟着它走！”赛勒斯·史密斯说。\\n\\n 居民们立刻沿着电线，急急忙忙地向前走去。\\n\\n 雷声不断地轰鸣，连说话也听不见。不过，现在大家都在尽快地赶路，也顾不得说话了。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们爬上畜栏的山谷和瀑布河谷之间隆起的支脉，从最狭的地方跨过瀑布河。电线有时架在较低的树枝上，有时就在地面上拖着，引导着他们。工程师认为陌生人的住处可能就在山谷的尽头，大概电线到那里就到头了。\\n\\n 然而事实完全不是那样。他们不得不爬上西南的支脉，再下降到贫瘠的高地上来；高地的尽头就是奇形怪状的、荒凉的玄武岩峭壁了。居民们不时弯下腰来摸索电线；事实上现在已经可以肯定，电线是一直通到大海去的。他们长久以来一直没有找到的住所，一定就在沿海一带的岩石深处。\\n\\n 天空简直象着了火似的。电光不断地闪耀着。有几道闪电就打在浓烟环抱的火山顶上。火山好象喷起火来。快到十一点钟的时候，居民们来到了俯临西边大洋的峭壁上。起风了。在五百英尺以下的地方，浪涛翻腾着。\\n\\n 根据史密斯的估计，他们离开畜栏已经有一英里半了。\\n\\n 电线沿着峡谷的一面悬崖，从一大堆岩石里拉了进去。岩石勉强保持住平衡，居民们顺着电线，冒险从上面走过去。这里随时都有掉在海里的危险，特别是下坡非常困难，但是他们没有考虑危险；他们已经没法控制自己了。一种不可抗拒的力量，象吸铁石似的，吸引着他们向那个神秘的地方走去。\\n\\n 这个峡谷，即使在白天也是很难通行的，但是他们却几乎自己也不知道怎么走的，居然从峡谷里走了下去。\\n\\n 他们在亮光中穿行着，岩石纷纷地滚在地上，迸发出火星来，象一个个的大火球。史密斯在前面领路，艾尔通跟在后头。他们一步一步地往前走。他们一会儿在又湿又滑的石头上摔倒下去，一会儿又挣扎起来，继续往前爬行。\\n\\n 电线突然拐到海滩上的岩石那儿去了。海滩上布满了暗礁，波涛不时冲刷着岩石。居民们已经到了玄武岩峭壁的尽头。\\n\\n 这里有一道狭窄的分水岭，它和海面保持着平行的水平方向。居民们沿着电线，在分水岭上往前走。不到一百步，分水岭平缓地降落到海面来了。\\n\\n 工程师在暗中摸索，发现电线钻入了海底。\\n\\n 他的伙伴们都楞住了。\\n\\n 他们大叫起来，感到十分灰心，几乎是绝望了！难道他们必须钻到水里去找海底的洞穴吗？按当时感情冲动的情况看来，他们毫不犹豫是会这样去做的。\\n\\n 工程师拦住了大家。\\n\\n 他把伙伴们领到一个石洞里。\\n\\n “等一会儿，”他说。“现在潮水正高。落潮的时候，路就会现出来的。”\\n\\n “你怎么知道的……”潘克洛夫问道。\\n\\n “要是我们没法到他那儿去，他就不会要我们来了！”\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯的口气充满了信心，谁也没有反对。况且，他的看法也是合乎逻辑的。峭壁底下很可能有一个洞穴，虽然在目前涨潮的时候被海水淹没了，但是只要潮水落下去，就可以通行的。\\n\\n 他们还要等很久。居民们默默地蜷缩在一个深洞里。这时候，倾盆大雨开始直泻下来，雷声从山石间发出轰隆隆的回响。\\n\\n 居民们的情绪非常高涨。他们的脑海里产生了无数稀奇古怪的念头。他们估计会看见一个相貌堂堂、和凡人不一样的神灵，因为只有这样的人才符合他们想象中岛上的神秘圣人。\\n\\n 到午夜的时候，史密斯拿着灯到海滩下面去探测。\\n\\n 果然不出工程师所料。水落下去以后，露出一个庞大的洞口。电线折过一个直角，从洞口进入了开阔的港湾。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯回到伙伴们身边来，简单地说：\\n\\n “再过一个钟头，洞里就可以通行了。”\\n\\n “那么，真的有洞吗？”潘克洛夫问道。\\n\\n “你还不相信吗？”史密斯回问了一句。\\n\\n “可是洞里的水位一定会相当高的。”赫伯特说。\\n\\n “我认为有两种可能性，一种是洞里一点水也没有，可以让我们徒步走进去，一种是虽然有水，但是有交通工具供给我们使用。”史密斯说。\\n\\n 一个钟头过去了。大家冒雨爬到海面上。这时候水面上露出的洞口已经有八英尺了，象一个桥孔似的，奔腾澎湃的波涛在下面汹涌着。\\n\\n 工程师弯下身去，只见有一个黑色的东西在水面漂浮。他把它拉过来。原来是一只系在洞内尖石上的小船。船身包着铁皮，里面放着两把桨。\\n\\n “上船！”史密斯说。\\n\\n 居民们立刻都上了船。纳布和艾尔通把着桨，潘克洛夫掌着舵。赛勒斯·史密斯在船头拿着灯照路。\\n\\n 小船最初经过一个椭圆形的檐顶，然后顶部突然升高了。但是周围一片漆黑，灯光又暗，既看不出洞的宽度、长度和高度，又没法知道它有多深。这个玄武岩的洞窟里一点声音也没有。外面的声音——甚至连隆隆的雷声——也没法透过它的厚壁，传到里面来。\\n\\n 世界上很多地方都有这种庞大的洞窟。它们是在地球的地质时代形成的天然地窖。有的里面灌满了海水。有的里西藏着整个的湖泊。这样的洞窟很多，例如赫布里底群岛中史泰法岛上的芬加尔山洞；布列塔尼半岛上道亚尼尼士港马甲特的洞窟；科西嘉岛波尼法西俄港的洞窟；挪威来福德的洞窟；以及肯特基州的五百英尺高、二十多英里长的庞大的曼摩斯山洞！自然界在世界各地开凿了这些山洞，供人们欣赏。\\n\\n 居民们现在探测的洞窟是不是一直通到荒岛的中心呢？工程师不时发出简短的指示，潘克洛夫按指示驾船，弯弯曲曲地走了一刻钟。突然，工程师命令道：\\n\\n “再偏右一些！”\\n\\n 小船改变了方向，贴近右壁前进。工程师想知道电线是不是还沿着这一边向洞里通过去。\\n\\n 电线还钉在这里的岩石上。\\n\\n “往前走！”史密斯说。\\n\\n 小船由两桨推动着，在黑黝黝的水里前进。\\n\\n 他们又往前划了一刻钟，这时候离洞口大约有半英里了，只听见史密斯又喊道：\\n\\n “打住！”\\n\\n 小船停下来了。只见一道夺目的光芒照亮了庞大的洞窟，这个洞窟深深地开凿在荒岛的地心。居民们从来也没有想到竟有这样一个地方。\\n\\n 在一百英尺的头顶上，高悬着圆形的拱顶，许多玄武岩的石柱支撑着。这些数不清的石柱从地球形成的最初年代就竖立起来了，柱子上有许多参差不齐的穹窿和奇形怪状的花边。玄武岩的栋梁一个套着一个，高度从四十英尺到五十英尺不等。尽管洞外的怒潮正在奔腾，这里面的海水却总是平静地冲刷着栋梁的底部。工程师指出明亮光源，它照遍了整个洞窟，所有石壁都被照得一片光亮。\\n\\n 在亮光的照耀下，水波也反映出片片银光，小船好象在上下两片光亮夺目的地带之间漂浮着。\\n\\n 中心光源向四面八方发射出光芒，它清清楚楚地照亮了洞里的每一个角落，每一块凸出的岩石。这种光的性质是瞒不过居民们的。这是一种电力的光源，从它那银白的颜色上就足以说明这一点。它是洞里的太阳，它照亮了整个的洞窟。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯做了一个手势，双桨又划起来了。溅起的水花，恰象一阵阵珠光宝气的细雨。小船朝着光源驶去，现在离那里已经不到半锚链了。\\n\\n 这里的水面宽度将近三百五十英尺。在耀眼的光源后面，有一大片玄武岩的石壁，完全堵住了那边的出路。洞窟的这部分相当宽大，海水形成一个小湖。穹顶、四壁、尽头的悬崖、全部的棱柱和尖顶都浸浴在电光里，它们被照耀得灿烂夺目，好象光就是从它们本身发出来似的。\\n\\n 湖中心浮着一个长长的、象雪茄烟似的东西。它一动也不动，静静地躺在水面上。亮光从它的两边发出来，就好象是从两个白热的炉灶里放射出来的一样。它的外形象一只庞大的鲸鱼，长约二百五十英尺，高出水面十到十二英尺。\\n\\n 小船慢慢地向它驶近了。赛勒斯·史密斯站在船头望着，兴奋得几乎不能自制。然后，他突然抓住通讯记者的胳膊，叫道：\\n\\n “是他！一定是他！他……”\\n\\n 然后，他往下一坐，喃喃地说出一个名字。只有吉丁·史佩莱听见他说的是什么。\\n\\n 通讯记者显然是知道这个名字的，因为他听了以后，马上起了一种奇怪的反应，接着，他沙哑地说：\\n\\n “他！那个逍遥自在的人！”\\n\\n “是他！”史密斯说。\\n\\n 在工程师的指挥下，小船到这个奇怪的漂浮物旁边来了。他们停靠在它的左边，这里有一道光芒透过厚厚的玻璃射出来。\\n\\n 史密斯和他的伙伴们登上平台。这里有一个敞开的仓口。大家一齐从仓口冲下去。\\n\\n 扶梯的尽头是一片甲板，上面有电灯照耀着。甲板的尽头有一扇门，史密斯上去把门打开。\\n\\n 这是一间装饰得富丽堂皇的屋子。居民们迅速穿过这间屋子，走进隔壁的书房，在书房里，从明亮的天花板上投下一片光辉。\\n\\n 书房的尽头是一扇大门，也是关着的，工程师打开了门。\\n\\n 这是一间非常宽敞的大厅。它象博物馆似的，陈列着各种珍贵的矿物制成品、艺术品和神奇的工业品。居民们看见这许多东西，几乎以为自己忽然到了“太虚幻境”了。\\n\\n 他们看见在一张高贵的沙发上有一个人躺着，那个人似乎根本没有注意他们进来。\\n\\n 这时候史密斯开口了。他的伙伴们感到十分惊讶，只听见他说：\\n\\n “尼摩船长，是您要我们来的吗？我们来了。”\\n\\n \\n\\n
