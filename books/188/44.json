{"id":5854,"no":44,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 2","content":"There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates\u0027 intentions. They had dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the beach!\n Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined though they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their presence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting themselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of the island. It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at the Chimneys might escape their notice.\n But why was that flag hoisted at the brig\u0027s peak? What was that shot fired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates\u0027 guns? A few muskets only.\n \"However,\" observed Cyrus Harding, \"here we are in an impregnable position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate into Granite House.\"\n \"But our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!\" exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. \"They may spoil everything, destroy everything in a few hours!\"\n \"Everything, Pencroft,\" answered Harding, \"and we have no means of preventing them.\"\n \"Are they numerous? that is the question,\" said the reporter. \"If they are not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty, fifty, more perhaps!\"\n \"Captain Harding,\" then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer, \"will you give me leave?\"\n \"For what, my friend?\"\n \"To go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.\"\n \"But Ayrton--\" answered the engineer, hesitating, \"you will risk your life--\"\n \"Why not, sir?\"\n \"That is more than your duty.\"\n \"I have more than my duty to do,\" replied Ayrton.\n \"Will you go to the ship in the boat?\" asked Gideon Spilett.\n \"No, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide between wind and water.\"\n \"Do you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?\" said Herbert.\n \"I am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.\"\n \"I tell you it is risking your life,\" said the engineer.\n \"That is no matter,\" answered Ayrton. \"Captain Harding, I ask this as a favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!\"\n \"Go, Ayrton,\" replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.\n \"I will accompany you,\" said Pencroft.\n \"You mistrust me!\" said Ayrton quickly.\n Then more humbly,--\n \"Alas!\"\n \"No! no!\" exclaimed Harding with animation, \"no, Ayrton, Pencroft does not mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.\"\n \"Indeed,\" returned the sailor, \"I only propose to accompany Ayrton as far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one of these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too many to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do so.\" These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night. Once arrived at the vessel\u0027s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions of the pirates.\n Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer less from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.\n Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.\n Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.\n It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.\n The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey, it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights had recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion.\n In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided through the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often frequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from the shore.\n Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors\u0027 trousers. He put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not sleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing, laughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which principally struck Ayrton:--\n \"Our brig is a famous acquisition.\"\n \"She sails well, and merits her name of the \u0027Speedy.\u0027\"\n \"She would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.\"\n \"Hurrah for her captain!\"\n \"Hurrah for Bob Harvey!\"\n What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one of his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his criminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had gone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches, more ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels, and massacring their crews.\n The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew of the \"Speedy\" was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from Norfolk Island.\n Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2\u0027 south latitude, and 165deg 42\u0027 east longitude, to the east of Australia, is found a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea. This is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were lodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries. They numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed under the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine a collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,--although very rarely,--notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.\n Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly wished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig \"Speedy,\" anchored in sight of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship had scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and well known to Ayrton!\n The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a few, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.\n The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton learned that chance alone had brought the \"Speedy\" in sight of Lincoln Island; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding had conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position being marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and, if he found it suitable, of making it the brig\u0027s headquarters.\n As to the black flag hoisted at the \"Speedy\u0027s\" peak, and the gun which had been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their colors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.\n The settlers\u0027 domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security. Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and Bob Harvey and his accomplices\u0027 first care would be to massacre them without mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts intended to reside there, and since, in the event of the \"Speedy\" departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it would be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of thinking.\n But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she carried.\n This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto the \"Speedy\u0027s\" deck, which the extinguished lanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding among the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the ship, and found that the \"Speedy\" carried four guns, which would throw shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching them that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern make, easily used, and of terrible effect.\n As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on board. That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to contend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton\u0027s devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and would make his arrangements accordingly.\n There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his companions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself, and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let himself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was to sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who, either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he thought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an honest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works destroyed, their island turned into a pirates\u0027 den! He said to himself that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a feeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had on board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his duty.\n Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be enough to destroy it in an instant.\n Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished with weapons of all sorts.\n Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was loaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the brig\u0027s poop at the powder-magazine.\n It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without stumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and kicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the magazine itself.\n Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.\n At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton\u0027s shoulder.\n \"What are you doing here?\" asked a tail man, in a harsh voice, who, standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton\u0027s face.\n Ayrton drew beck. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized his former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he must have thought Ayrton long since dead.\n \"What are you doing here?\" again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the waistband.\n But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and attempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the powder-casks, and all would be over!\n \"Help, lads!\" shouted Bob Harvey.\n At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from their grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his shoulder.\n Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project. Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement on the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must reserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing for him but flight!\n But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to dare everything in order to rejoin his companions.\n Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were fired-- one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his adversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck. Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of his revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at the same moment.\n A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not understanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea.\n Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him like hail.\n What were Pencroft\u0027s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel any attack.\n They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates, had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night to make a descent on the island!\n Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded? Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The tide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat was not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession of Harding and his companions!\n At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft, safe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.\n All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had attempted to put into execution.\n All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that their situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers and well armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall into their hands, they must expect no mercy!\n \"Well, we shall know how to die!\" said the reporter.\n \"Let us go in and watch,\" answered the engineer.\n \"Have we any chance of escape, captain?\" asked the sailor.\n \"Yes, Pencroft.\"\n \"Hum! six against fifty!\"\n \"Yes! six! without counting--\"\n \"Who?\" asked Pencroft.\n Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.\n 海盗们的企图已经很明显了。他们在离岛不远的地方抛了锚，显然准备第二天利用小艇在海滩上登陆！\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们随时准备采取行动。虽然他们下定了决心，但还是不能麻痹大意。假如海盗们登陆以后，不到岛内来视察的话，他们还可以隐藏起来。海盗们也许只想从慈悲河里取一些淡水。如果真是这样的话，他们也可能不会发现离河口一英里半的那座桥和“石窟”的工场。\n 但是船顶上为什么要挂起那面旗呢？为什么要开那一炮呢？毫无疑问，这纯粹是示威性质，要不然就是表示他们占领荒岛了。史密斯现在知道，船上的武器装备得十分完备，林肯岛上的移民应该用什么来对付海盗们的炮火呢？只不过有几支滑膛枪罢了。\n “不管怎么样，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我们的阵地是攻不破的。现在‘花岗石宫’的出口有芦苇和乱草掩蔽着，敌人是不会发现它的，因此他们就不可能攻进来。”\n “但是我们的农场，家禽场，畜栏，我们的一切！”潘克洛夫一面跺脚一面嚷道。“要不了几个钟头，他们就会把这一切都给毁了的！”\n “是的，一切都会被毁灭的，潘克洛夫。”史密斯答道，“可是我们没法阻止他们。”\n “他们人多吗，这是一个问题，”通讯记者说。“要是他们只有十来个人，我们是能够阻止他们的，但是也许有四十、五十，或者更多呢！”\n “史密斯先生，”艾尔通一面向工程师走过来，一面说，“你能让我去一趟吗？”\n “去干什么，朋友？”\n “到船上去探听一下敌人的实力。”\n “但是，艾尔通……”工程师犹豫不决地答道，“你这样做是有生命危险的……”\n “为什么不可以呢，先生？”\n “这不是你份内的事。”\n “份外的事我也应该做。”艾尔通答道。\n “你打算坐小船去吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。\n “不，先生，我泅水去。坐船会被他们发现的，光一个人却可以从风浪之间游过去。”\n “那只船离岸有一又四分之一英里，你知道吗？”赫伯特说。\n “我是一个熟谙水性的人，赫伯特先生。”\n “我告诉你，这样做是有生命危险的。”工程师说。\n “不要紧，”艾尔通答道。“史密斯先生，我请求你答应我的要求，我认为这也许是我重新做人的一个机会。”\n “去吧，艾尔通。”工程师答道，他深信如果拒绝他的请求，这个改邪归正的罪犯一定会深深地感到伤心的。\n “我跟你一起去。”潘克洛夫说。\n “那你就是不信任我！”艾尔通立刻说。\n 然后他又腼腆地叹息了一声：“唉！”\n “不要这样！不要这样！”史密斯带着鼓舞的口气大声说，“别误会，艾尔通，潘克洛夫并不是不信任你。你误解他的意思了。”\n “的确是这样，”水手说，“我只是提议把艾尔通送到小岛上。虽然可能性很小，但也许有匪徒已经上岸了。在这种情况下，要阻止他发出警报，两个人不算多吧。既然他提议要单独去，我就在小岛上等他，让他一个人上船。”\n 事情商量妥当以后，艾尔通就准备出发了。他的计划很冒险，但是夜色非常昏暗，或者有成功的可能。只要能到达船边，抓住主要的链条，艾尔通就可以侦查出船上的人数，甚至也许还能偷听到海盗们的意图。\n 艾尔通和潘克洛夫在伙伴们的陪伴之下，来到下面的海滩上。艾尔通脱掉衣服，在身上抹上一层油，以免受冻，因为海水还很凉。事实上他也许不得不在水里呆几个钟头。\n 这时候，潘克洛夫和纳布去搬停在慈悲河上几百英尺的那只小船了。他们回来的时候，艾尔通把衣服搭在肩膀上，只等动身了。居民们都跑过来和他握手。\n 于是艾尔通和潘克洛夫把船撑开了。\n 十点半的时候，这两个冒险家消失在黑暗中了。他们的伙伴们到“石窟”那里去等待着他们。\n 小船顺利地渡过海峡，在对面的小岛上靠了岸。他们一举一动非常小心，深怕有海盗在那里溜达。经过仔细侦察以后，肯定小岛上并没有人。于是潘克洛夫跟在艾尔通后面，急急忙忙穿过小岛，石洞里的飞鸟也被他们惊动起来了。然后，艾尔通毫不迟疑地往海里一跳，无声无息地朝着双桅船游过去。船上刚刚亮起灯光，正好标示出它的正确位置。潘克洛夫蹲在乱石堆里面，等他的伙伴回来。\n 这时候，艾尔通在水面上用力向前游去，丝毫也没有发出水声。他仅仅把头露出水面，两眼注视着暗黑的船身。船上的灯光倒映在水里。他所考虑的只有自己保证完成任务，至于船上的和这一带常有鲨鱼出没的海里的危险，却一点也没有想到。水流带着他前进，很快就离开了海岸。\n 半个钟头以后，艾尔通神不知鬼不觉地到了船边，抓住船上的主链。他喘了一口气，然后攀着主链，一直爬到船的最前端。有几条水手裤晾在那里，他穿上一条，然后稳稳地站住了脚，静静地倾听着。船上的人都没有睡，相反地，有的在谈笑，有的在唱歌。他们一面高谈阔论，一面谩骂，最使艾尔通触到隐痛的是这几句话：\n “我们得来的这只船真是刮刮叫。”\n “在海里航行起来真不错，不愧称为‘飞快’号。”\n “诺福克的船队没有一只能追得上它。”\n “船长万岁！”\n “鲍勃·哈维万岁！”\n 艾尔通无意听到了鲍勃·哈维的名字，这个人是一个胆大包天的水手，同时也是艾尔通过去的澳洲伙伴，他现在还在继续干犯罪的勾当。当艾尔通听到这段谈话的时候，他的心情是可以想象的。鲍勃·哈维在诺福克岛的海岸掠夺了这只双桅船，船上装载着武器、弹药、器皿和各种工具。这只船原来是打算开往三明治群岛的一个岛屿去的，自从被他抢到手以后，那一帮罪犯就成了海盗。这些匪徒出没在太平洋上，抢劫过往的船只，屠杀船上的人，比马来海盗还要惨无人道。\n 罪犯们一面开怀畅饮，一面高声谈笑，追述着过去所做的那些可耻的勾当。艾尔还从他们的谈话里知道：飞快号上的船员都是从诺福克岛上逃出来的英国罪犯。\n 现在不妨谈一谈诺福克岛的情况。在澳大利亚以东，南纬29度2分，东经165度42分的地方，有一个小岛，周围六法里，岛上有一座华特山，拔海一千一百英尺。这个诺福克岛上曾经监禁过英国感化院里最顽固的罪犯。当时岛上的罪犯有五百名，岛上不但纪律森严，而且有苦刑威胁着他们。此外还有一百五十名士兵监管，这一百五十名士兵都是听总督指挥的。很难想象有比他们更坏的暴徒聚在一起了。虽然对他们的监管非常严厉，有时候还是有些人逃跑，不过这种事是很少的。他们突袭船只，把船抢过来，在玻里尼西亚群岛一带到处骚扰。\n 鲍勃·哈维和他的伙伴过去就是这样做的。这也就是艾尔通从前的愿望。鲍勃·哈维掠夺了停在诺福克岛附近的飞快号，把船上的人都杀死了；一年来，他指挥着这只船在太平洋上到处骚扰，现在他是一个海盗了，而且他是艾尔通的旧相识！\n 这些罪犯大部分都在船尾仓内，但是也有几个躺在甲板上高谈阔论。\n 他们一面饮酒喊叫，一面继续谈话。艾尔通知道飞快号是偶然来到林肯岛附近的。鲍勃·哈维从来也没有到林肯岛上来过。正和赛勒斯·史密斯所想的一样，他在航行中发现了这块地图上所没有的陌生陆地，就打定主意要到岛上来视察一番，要是中意的话，就把它当作双桅船的大本营。\n 至于飞快号上所挂的黑旗，和模仿军舰在降旗时鸣放的礼炮，那纯粹是海盗的示威行为，决不是什么信号，因为当时他们和林肯岛上并没有什么联系。\n 居民们的领地现在面临着严重的危险了。荒岛上有贮水场和港口，还有可以藏身的“花岗石宫”；此外，经过居民们的努力开发，岛上的各种资源变得更有价值了。这一切对罪犯们说来，显然是非常便利的。它一旦落在海盗们的手里，就将要成为优越的藏身之地；而且既然没有人知道这个地方，可能在很长的一段时间内，都能保证他们安全无事。显然，他们是不会重视居民们的生命的。鲍勃·哈维和他的部下所考虑的头一桩事，就是要惨无人道地杀死他们。由于这些罪犯打算在岛上住下来，并且当飞快号出去打劫的时候，还可能要留下几个人来看守，史密斯和他的伙伴们就要束手无策了。因此，只好进行斗争，只好不惜采用任何手段把这些不值得同情的恶棍全部歼灭。艾尔通这样想着，他知道赛勒斯·史密斯一定也会这样想的。\n 但是抵抗和取得最后胜利是不是可能呢？这就要看船上的装备和人数了。\n 艾尔通决定不惜任何代价查清楚这一点。他上船一个钟头以后，船上的喧哗声逐渐静下来了。不少的罪犯已经烂醉如泥，于是艾尔通就毫不犹豫地冒险爬上飞快号的甲板。那时灯光已经灭了，仓面上一片漆黑。他抓住船头，攀住牙樯，爬到前甲板上，从东倒西歪的罪犯们中间穿过去，在船上绕了一周，发现飞快号装备着四门大炮，这些炮可以发射八磅至十磅重的炮弹。他用手一摸，知道都是后膛炮，这种炮非常新颖，操纵灵便，威力极大。\n 甲板上大约躺着十个人，但是一定还有很多人睡在下面。从他们的谈话里，艾尔通知道船上一共有五十个人。对林肯岛上的六个居民来说，要和这么多的人战斗，实在不是一件容易的事！多亏艾尔通一片热心，现在赛勒斯·史密斯可以知道敌人的实力，并且可以适当地进行安排，不致惊慌失措了。\n 艾尔通已经完成任务，只等回去把任务的完成情况告诉伙伴们了，他准备摸索到船头，然后下水。\n 但是，正象他自己所说的，份外的工作他也要做，因此他产生了一个英勇的念头：牺牲自己的性命，来挽救林肯岛和岛上的移民。赛勒斯·史密斯肯定是打不过这五十名匪徒的。海盗们的武器精良，不论是集中主力直捣“花岗石宫”，还是用围困的方法使他们饿死，都能够达到他们的目的。这时候艾尔通又想起了他的保护人，他们使他脱胎换骨，成了一个好人，对他来说，真是恩重如山。但是，他们将要无情地遭到屠杀了，他们的劳动成果将要遭到毁坏，他们的岛屿将要沦为海盗的巢穴！他对自己说：他就是造成这许多不幸后果的主要原因，因为他的老伙伴鲍勃·哈维只不过是实现了他过去的计划。想到这里，他不由得毛发悚然。于是，他产生了一个一不做二不休的意图，诀定炸毁这只船和全船的人。即使他自己也要在爆炸的时候牺牲，但是他总算尽到自己的责任了。\n 艾尔通丝毫也没有迟疑。要找火药库并不困难，因为它通常总是在船的后半部。做这种勾当的船是不会缺少火药的，只要一粒火星，就可以顿时把它炸毁了。\n 艾尔通悄悄地沿着中仓甲板走去，甲板上到处都躺着熟睡的人，他们大多是喝醉的而不是睡着的。主桅的底部点着一盏灯，周围支着一个枪架，上面各种武器都有。\n 艾尔通从枪架上拿了一支左轮枪。他看了一下，知道里面装满了弹药。这就足够用来完成这件破坏工作了。于是他直奔船尾，到后仓下的火药库去。\n 甲板上光线很暗，要想走过去，而不被那些半睡半醒的罪犯绊倒却不是一件容易的事。每当他绊在他们身上，他们就开口谩骂，或是一脚踢过来。因此艾尔通不得不一再停下脚步来。终于来到后仓的隔板旁边，并且找到了通往火药库的那扇门。\n 艾尔通没有别的办法开门，只有用力把它打开，于是他就动手打门了。要想进行这项工作，必须砸坏门上的挂锁，这样做是难免要发出一些响声的。但是他的腕力很大，一下子拧坏了挂锁，库门开了。\n 这时候，忽然有一只手搭在艾尔通的肩膀上。\n “你在这里做什么？”一个高个子的人站在幻影里，粗鲁地问道，他很快地把灯光照在艾尔通的脸上。\n 艾尔通倒退几步。灯光一闪，他认出了这正是他当年的伙伴鲍勃·哈维，但是对方一定已经不认识他，因为他以为艾尔通早就死了。\n “你在这里做什么？”鲍勃·哈维抓住艾尔通的腰带，又问了一句。\n 可是艾尔通没有回答，他挣脱了他的手，打算冲到火药库里去。只要对着火药箱放一枪，就大功告成了！\n “帮忙呀，伙计们！”鲍勃·哈维大叫起来。\n 两三个强盗被他喊醒了。他们跳起身来，向艾尔通扑过去，想把他扳倒在地上。他立刻闪开身子，开了两枪，两个罪犯倒下去了。但是他自己也因为来不及躲避，肩膀上被砍了一刀。\n 艾尔通眼看自己的计划不可能实现了。鲍勃·哈维已经把火药库门关好，并且甲板上稍一响动，海盗们全都惊醒了过来。艾尔通必须保全自己来帮助赛勒斯·史密斯战斗。因此他只好逃走！\n 但是，还逃得了吗？这是一个问题。不过，艾尔通决定要尽一切努力回到伙伴们那里去。\n 他的枪里还剩下四颗子弹。刚才打的两颗，有一颗打的是鲍勃·哈维，但没有把他打伤，至多也不过是微伤。艾尔通乘着敌人暂时后退的工夫，冲上扶梯往甲板跑去。经过灯下面的时候，他用枪托一下子把灯打灭了。于是周围一片漆黑，他就便于逃跑了。这时候，有两三个海盗惊醒了，他们从扶梯上跑下来。艾尔通的第五枪打倒了其中的一个，其余的还不知道发生了什么事情，就往后退去。艾尔通两步跳上了甲板，三秒钟以后，一个海盗几乎掐住他的咽喉，他的最后一颗子弹打中了这个海盗的脸，然后他就越过舷栏往海里跳去。\n 艾尔通划了不到六下，枪弹就象冰雹似的向他周围打过来了。\n 船上的枪声响了，躲在小岛岩石下的潘克洛夫会怎样想呢？蹲在“石窟”里的史密斯、通讯记者、赫伯特和纳布又会怎样想呢？他们四个人扛着枪冲到海滩上，随时准备抵抗敌人的攻击。\n 他们以为艾尔通一定是遭到了海盗的突击，已经被打死了。也许匪徒们还要乘黑夜到岛上来呢！\n 他们焦急不安地等了半个钟头。枪声已经停止了，但是艾尔通和潘克洛夫都没有回来。小岛已经被敌人侵占了吗？他们应该赶快去援救艾尔通和潘克洛夫吗？怎么去呢？这时候正在涨潮，海峡是渡不过去的。船又不在这里！史密斯和他的伙伴的焦急是不难想象的！\n 将近十二点半的时候，他们两个人所乘的小船终于靠岸了。艾尔通肩膀上受了轻伤，潘克洛夫还是安然无恙，大家都用热烈的拥抱来欢迎他们。\n 他们立刻躲到“石窟”里去。在那里，艾尔通把全部经过都说了一遍，还说到他打算毁灭这只船的计划。\n 人人都向艾尔通伸出手来。艾尔通也坦白地表示他们的处境是非常危险的。海盗惊动了。他们已经知道林肯岛上有人。他们会全副武装，强行登陆的。他们是什么也不会顾忌的。居民们一旦落在他们的手里，就不要想活命。\n “好吧，我们不会白白牺牲的！”通讯记者说。\n “我们进去守望吧。”工程师答道。\n “我们还有逃脱的机会吗，史密斯先生？”水手问道。\n “有的，潘克洛夫。”\n “嘿！六对五十！”\n “是的！六个！不包括……”\n “谁？”潘克洛夫问道。\n 赛勒斯指着上面，没有回答。\n \n
