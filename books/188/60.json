{"id":5870,"no":60,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 18","content":"At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern, to which they gave the name of \"Dakkar Grotto,\" in memory of Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty under the arcade, washed on the right by the sea. The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it could run no risk of harm. The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather. Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken the road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service. The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the night of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The unknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more. His \"Nautilus\" and he were buried in the depths of the abyss. To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated than before. They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of that power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a profound silence during their journey to the corral. Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House. It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be actively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his time and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future lay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great of having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the sea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of need, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be completed, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to Ayrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility of the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest importance that nothing should be neglected on this point. The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton, assisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably called off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It was important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that is to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable. Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary to manufacture rigging, that of the \"Speedy\" having been saved entire, so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed. The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors, to the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at sea. Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble when one or the other abandoned the carpenter\u0027s axe for the gun of the hunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite House, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy Pencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard. when this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by way of venting his feelings, did the work of six men. The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season. For some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated with electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that the distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but incessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the globe. The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence, and the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of those gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the southern extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the earth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms. It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak to the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers, perceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano. Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in watching the summit of Mount Franklin. \"Ah!\" exclaimed Pencroft, \"those are not vapors this time! It seems to me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!\" This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the changes going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months had the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet produced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a grayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred feet above the summit of the mountain. \"The fire is in the chimney,\" observed Gideon Spilett. \"And we can\u0027t put it out!\" replied Herbert. \"The volcano ought to be swept,\" observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly serious. \"Well said, Neb!\" cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; \"and you\u0027ll undertake the job, no doubt?\" Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant muttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone somewhat apart, he said,-- \"The truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an important change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption.\" \"Well, captain,\" said Pencroft, \"we shall witness the eruption; and if it is a good one, we\u0027ll applaud it. I don\u0027t see that we need concern ourselves further about the matter.\" \"It may be so,\" replied Cyrus Harding, \"for the ancient track of the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto overflowed towards the north. And yet--\" \"And yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be better it should not take place,\" said the reporter. \"Who knows?\" answered the sailor. \"Perhaps there may be some valuable substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may turn to good account!\" Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava, in consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace the wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might present themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk of disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the gravest consequences. \"It seems to me,\" said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear to the ground, \"it seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound, like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.\" The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced that Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a subterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly away, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of the globe. But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might therefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage through the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently large, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be apprehended. \"Well, then!\" said Pencroft, \"are we not going back to work? Let Mount Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb, Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at our work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair of hands would not be too many. Before two months I want our new \u0027Bonadventure\u0027-- for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?--to float on the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!\" All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft, descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all took part. They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of January, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not, besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice, large shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried all these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett remarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed the evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption. It was, besides, of the first importance from every point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least possible delay. In presence of the eventualities which might arise, the safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their ship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge? In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke accumulated at the mouth of the crater. \"The crater is on fire!\" said Herbert, who, more active than his companion, first reached the plateau. Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much smoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that their light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor obscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars. \"The change is rapid!\" said the engineer. \"That is not surprising,\" answered the reporter. \"The reawakening of the volcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the mountain to discover Captain Nemo\u0027s retreat. It was, if I mistake not, about the 15th of October.\" \"Yes,\" replied Herbert, \"two months and a half ago!\" \"The subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,\" resumed Gideon Spilett, \"and it is not to be wondered at that they now break out with such violence!\" \"Do not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?\" asked Cyrus Harding. \"Yes,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"but there is a great difference between that and an earthquake.\" \"I do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,\" answered Cyrus Harding, \"may God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to the effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is simply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the pressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. it is this effect which is being produced at this moment.\" \"What magnificent flames!\" exclaimed Herbert. At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater, the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of machine-guns. Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned to Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause. \"Yes, and no,\" answered Cyrus Harding. \"Nevertheless,\" continued the reporter, \"would not the greatest misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would overturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared, since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet.\" \"True,\" replied Cyrus Harding, \"and I do not fear an earthquake in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may produce great disasters.\" \"How so, my dear Cyrus?\u0027 \"I am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few days I shall learn more on this point.\" Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of the volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the echoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping soundly. Three days passed by--the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction of the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy. Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would only look at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,-- \"Ah! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.\" In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and it did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure, had yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on the northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain. Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other duties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the island. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where the flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the provision of forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as he was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton-- \"As you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.\" \"But, Captain Harding,\" exclaimed the sailor, \"our working days will not be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!\" \"We shall return to-morrow,\" replied Cyrus Harding, \"but it is necessary that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is progressing.\" \"The eruption! always the eruption!\" answered Pencroft, with an air of discontent. \"An important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself very little about it.\" Whatever might be the sailor\u0027s opinion, the expedition projected by the engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence. The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot. Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled heavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances. It was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange opacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered pumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were held in suspension in the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so fine that they have been observed in the air for whole months. After the eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was thus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were only with difficulty discernible. But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the present occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the corral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly changed the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately, the wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud dissolved itself over the sea. \"This is very singular, Captain Harding,\" said Ayrton. \"It is very serious,\" replied the engineer. \"This powdered pumice-stone, all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward in the lower depths of the volcano.\" \"But can nothing be done?\" \"Nothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you, therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red Creek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern aspect. Then--\" \"Well, Captain Harding?\" \"Then we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any rate I will come back for you in two hours.\" Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the engineer\u0027s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which seemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of an eruption. Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed Red Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had discovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration. How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he counted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by some piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected in this part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors. Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn, and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava. The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the northern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the central shaft. \"But I would prefer that it were so,\" said Cyrus Harding to himself. \"At any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed track. who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger does not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the danger does not lie there!\" Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on this side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his mind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch. He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder, interrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached the corral. Ayrton awaited him. \"The animals are cared for, Captain Harding,\" said Ayrton. \"Good, Ayrton.\" \"They seem uneasy, Captain Harding.\" \"Yes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.\" \"Are you ready?\" \"Take a lamp, Ayrton,\" answered the engineer; \"we will start at once.\" Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral. The gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding Ayrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore. The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen from the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had fled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the two colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each other. They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated. It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments, to make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the oxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration. At every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was therefore past ten o\u0027clock when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island. Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity, following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure. The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon reached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped towards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no beach could he seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat upon the basaltic rocks. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it. \"The iron boat should be there,\" said the engineer. \"It is here, Captain Harding,\" replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault. \"On board, Ayrton!\" The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there Ayrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took the oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered through the shades of the grotto. The \"Nautilus\" was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of Captain Nemo. The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled the engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain. \"That comes from the volcano,\" he said. Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors. \"This is what Captain Nemo feared,\" murmured Cyrus Harding, changing countenance. \"We must go to the end, notwithstanding.\" \"Forward!\" replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat towards the head of the cavern. Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat reached the extreme end. Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a hundred feet--it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great thickness. The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed the basaltic wall at a greater elevation. There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken by large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of the water\u0027s edge. Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,-- \"Yes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible danger!\" Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of Dakkar Grotto. 天亮的时候，居民们默默地回到洞窟的出口，为了纪念尼摩船长，他们把这里叫做达卡洞。现在正是落潮的时候，他们毫不困难地从拱形洞口下边穿过去，海水从右边冲刷着船身。 他们把小船小心地保存在这里，使它不受海水的冲击。为了防备万一起见，潘克洛夫、纳布和艾尔通又把船拉回洞内，放在洞壁一边的沙滩上，在这里是不会受到任何损伤的。 暴风雨在夜里就已经停息了。最后几声低沉的雷响在西方渐渐地平静下来。虽然雨已经不下了，天空却还满布着阴云。十月份是南半球春天的第一个月，总的来说，这个月的天气看不出有好转的朕兆。风向正在从一个罗盘方位转向另一个方位，这就不用指望有明朗的天气了。 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们离开了达卡洞，径直前往畜栏。纳布和赫伯特一路小心地把船长从畜栏拉到洞窟的电线收起来，以后也许会有用的。 居民们一路上很少说话。10月15日夜里发生的种种事情给他们留下了深刻的印象。尼摩船长——那个及时帮助他们的陌生人，那个他们想象中具有超凡力量的人，已经离开人间一去不复返了。他和他的诺第留斯号已经埋葬在深渊里。居民们人人都觉得比以前更加孤单了。他们过去常常期待的那种救助的力量巳经不存在了；连吉丁·史佩莱，甚至是赛勒斯·史密斯也免不了产生这种感觉。因此他们往畜栏走的时候一句话也没有说。 早上将近九点钟的时候，居民们回到了“花岗石宫”。 大家原来就有过决定，要积极加快进行造船工作。这回赛勒斯·史密斯更是投入了全部时间和力量，以求达到这个目的。未来的一切是没法预料的。如果有一只坚固的船，如果这只船在坏天气航海也不怕，在需要作相当长时期的航行的时候也不嫌小的话，肯定地说，对于移民们是有很大好处的。船造好以后，居民们即使不打算马上离开林肯岛，到太平洋玻里尼西亚群岛的任何一个小岛或新西兰的海岸，至少也要尽快地到达抱岛去，把关于艾尔通的通知留在那里。这项准备工作是必要的，因为苏格兰游船可能要重新到这一带海洋上来。在这一点上丝毫不能马虎，这是十分重要的。 于是工作重新开始了。赛勒斯·史密斯、潘克洛夫和艾尔通在纳布、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特的帮助下，不停地进行着工作，除非有其他的必要事情，才不得已暂时停止。值得注意的是，一旦刮起秋分的暴风，就没法航海了。他们要想在刮风以前到达抱岛去，就必须在三月初把船造好，也就是说，五个月内新船就得完工。于是木匠们一刻空余时间也不放过。飞快号上的索具全部都保留了下来，他们不需要制造索具，只要制造船身就行了。 1868年年底的时候，他们进行着这项重要工作，其他几乎什么都不干。两个半月以后，肋材摆正了，第一批铺板也放妥了。这时候已经看得出赛勒斯·史密斯的设计巧妙，船在海里一定可以航行得很好。 潘克洛夫工作得非常积极，甚至伙伴们放下斧头，拿起枪去打猎，他也要发牢骚。但是为了迎接冬天，“花岗石宫”里是必须保持相当数量的储备物资的。这么一来却引起了潘克洛夫的不高兴。工人们一离开造船所，勇敢而忠实的水手就会感到不满意。每当发生这种情况的时候，他就非常不满，他赌起气来，一个人干六个人的活。 整个的夏天，天气都不能令人满意。有几天热得吃不消，大气里充满了雷电，经过一阵狂风暴雨，才爽朗一些。难得有几天听不见远处的雷鸣，隆隆的雷声不断地响着，这正是地球上赤道地区的特色。 1869年1月1日发生了空前未有的暴风雨。荒岛上几次响起了霹雳声。闪电击倒了许多大树。湖的南岸有许多高大的榆树覆盖着家禽场，其中有一棵也被劈倒了。这种大气现象和地心的变化有没有关系呢？大气的振荡和地底的变动有没有牵连呢？赛勒斯·史密斯认为是有关系的，因为随着暴风雨的发作，火山复活的朕兆也显露出来了。 1月3日天刚亮的时候，赫伯特拿着缰绳打算给一头野驴套上，他爬上眺望岗的高地以后，发现火山顶上冒起了一大股象帽子似的烟雾。 赫伯特立刻告诉居民们，大家听了以后，马上和他一起出来观察富兰克林山的山顶。 “啊！”潘克洛夫大声说，“这一次不是水汽了！看样子这个大家伙不只是要喘气，它还要冒烟！” 水手的这个比喻恰好表达了火山口发生的变化。三个月来，火山口一直喷着水汽，虽然水汽有时候浓，有时候淡，但始终只是由于内部矿物质沸腾而引起的。然而现在却不是水汽了，代替水汽的是一股浓烟，它象一根灰色的柱子，底部宽达三百多英尺，上升到离山顶七八百英尺的高空，然后四面散开，象一个极大的蘑菇。 “喷烟口里有火了。”吉丁·史佩莱说。 “这火我们没法扑灭！”赫伯特说。 “应该把火山去掉。”纳布一本正经地说。 “说得好，纳布！”潘克洛夫大声笑道，“那么，这项工作一定由你来负责了？” 赛勒斯·史密斯离开伙伴，向前走了几步，注视着富兰克林山里冒出来的浓烟。他还倾听了一会儿，似乎认为远处应该有隆隆的响声。然后，他又回到伙伴们跟前来，说： “不错，朋友们，我们不能欺骗自己，现在要发生重大的变故了。火山内部现在不只是在沸腾，而是已经着了火，毫无疑问，我们将要受到火山爆发的威胁了。” “那么，史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫说，“我们就等着看它爆发吧。要是爆发得好，我们就鼓掌。我认为我们根本不必为这件事情进一步操心。” “也可能象你说的那样，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“因为古代的岩浆出口现在还开着。正因为这样，所以过去岩浆喷发出来，一直向北边流。可是……” “可是既然火山爆发对我们没有什么好处，最好还是不要爆发。”通讯记者说。 “那谁知道？”水手说。“也许这个火山里有什么宝贵的东西，要是把它喷出来，我们还可以利用呢！” 赛勒斯·史密斯摇摇头，好象预料这个突如其来的现象不会有好结果似的。他没有象潘克洛夫那样，把爆发的后果看得那么轻松。就算由于火山口的位置的缘故，岩浆不直接威胁岛上的森林和已经开拓的地带，但是爆发以后还是会引起其他“并发症”的。事实上，火山爆发往往会附带发生地震。林肯岛又是一个由不同地质形成的岛屿，有的地方是玄武岩，有的地方是花岗岩，北边是凝结的熔岩，南边是肥沃的土壤；这些物质不可能结合得很紧密，因此很有崩裂的危险。因为这个缘故，虽然熔浆四溢不一定会造成严重的灾祸，但是如果由于大地结构的动摇而使整个的荒岛解体，却会造成不堪设想的后果。 艾尔通趴在地上，把耳朵贴在地面听了一会儿，然后说，“我好象听见一种低沉的隆隆声，就象一辆拉着铁条的马车发出的声音。” 居民们聚精会神地听了一会儿，证明艾尔通并没有听错。在隆隆的响声里，还夹杂着一种地下的轰鸣，形成一种“渐强”的节奏；然后又慢慢地消失下去，好象地底下来了一阵狂风暴雨，逐渐又过去了似的。但是他们却听不到一般所说的爆炸声。由此，可以下这样的结论：水汽和浓烟可以从中央管道里自由地放出去，安全活门相当宽大，不致产生激变，因此也不必担心爆炸。 “好了！”潘克洛夫说，“我们还不回去工作吗？让富兰克林山去尽情地冒烟、轰鸣、吼叫和喷火吧，我们没有理由停工站在这里！来吧，艾尔通、纳布、赫伯特、史密斯先生、史佩莱先生，今天大家都得参加工作！我们现在要去装内龙骨了，十二条胳膊也不嫌多。新船造好以后，我们还用老名字乘风破浪号叫它，好不好？我计划在两个月以内，让我们的新乘风破浪号在气球港上漂浮！所以，一个钟头也不能浪费！” 在潘克洛夫的号召下，居民们全都走向造船所去安装内龙骨了。内龙骨是很厚的木料，它构成船的下部，把船身的肋材牢牢地结合在一起。人人都参加了这项艰巨的工作。 这一天是1月3日，他们整天在工作，没有进一步考虑火山的问题；再说，从“花岗石宫”下面的海滩上也看不见富兰克林山。但是，虽然这一天天气十分晴朗，太阳在运转的过程中，却有一两次被巨大的阴影遮住了，这说明有一股浓烟从太阳和林肯岛之间经过。岸上的风把这些水汽都刮到西边去了。赛勒斯·史密斯和吉丁·史佩莱注意到这几次天空阴暗的情况。火山复活的现象肯定在进一步发展着；他们时时讨论这个问题，但是工作并没有停顿。不论从哪方面来看，都应该尽快把船造好，这是最重要的前提。万一发生了变故，居民们只要有船，就有了非常可靠的保障。也许这只船将来会成为他们唯一的避难所，这又有谁知道呢？ 晚饭以后，赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特又爬上了眺望岗的高地。这时候天已经黑了。由于周围是昏暗的，他们可以看得出来，火山口上升的水汽和烟雾里是不是夹带着火焰或火山里喷出来的白热物体。 “山口着火了！”赫伯特比他的伙伴敏捷一些，他首先跑到高地上。 富兰克林山离他们大约有六英里。这时候，它象一个巨大的火把，顶端缭绕着一团烟火。山顶上浓烟密布，里面夹杂的大概是岩烬和熔渣，因此在苍茫的暮色中，火光显得很微弱。但是整个的荒岛上却笼罩着一片黯淡的红光，在红光映照中屹立着高岗上朦胧的树影。水汽象旋风似的升上去散成一大片，把天空遮满了，只能隐隐约约地看见几颗星星在闪烁。 “变得太快了！”工程师说。 “这并不稀奇，”通讯记者说。“火山已经复活很久了。你大概还记得，赛勒斯，我们第一次冒见水汽是在满山寻找尼摩船长的住处的时候。假如我没有记错的话，那是在10月15日前后。” “是的，”赫伯特说，“那是在两个半月以前！” “因此，地下火已经燃烧了十个星期了，”吉丁·史佩莱接着说，“现在它们发展到这个程度那是没有什么值得大惊小怪的！” “你觉得地面有些运动吗？”赛勒斯·史密斯问道。 “我感觉到一些了，”吉丁·史佩莱回答说，“可是这离地震还差得很远呢。” “我并没有说我们已经遭到地震的威胁了，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“但愿上帝保佑我们不要遭到地震！现在不是地震，这个震动是因为地心的火焰达到高热的缘故。地壳其实就好比锅炉的锅身，要知道，在蒸汽的压力下，锅身就会和响亮的金属片似的颤动起来。现在出现的就是这种现象。” “多么美丽的火焰啊！”赫伯特叫道。 这时候一串火花从火山口里直喷出来，虽然蒙着一层水汽，还是可以看得出火花的亮光。弯弯曲曲的火舌头和上万的火星向四面八方飞开。有的驱散了浓烟，留下一道白热的粉末，一直飞出烟雾的范围以外，同时还发出一连串的爆炸，象一排机关枪在发射似的。 赛勒斯·史密斯、通讯记者和赫伯特在眺望岗的高地上逗留了一个钟头，然后走下海滩，又回“花岗石宫”去了。工程师全神贯注地想着心事。他想得出神，吉丁·史佩莱止不住问他是不是担心火山爆发目前就会直接或间接地发生危险。 “也可以说是的，也可以说不是的。”赛勒斯·史密斯答道。 “不过，”通讯记者说，“我们所能遇到的最大的不幸，不就是能使荒岛崩毁的地震吗？我认为这倒不必害怕，因为出口畅通，水汽和岩浆能够喷得出去。” “不错，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我倒并不害怕一般由于地下气体膨胀而引起地面震撼的地震。怕的是还有别的原因会引起严重的后果。” “什么原因呢，亲爱的赛勒斯？” “我也不能肯定，需要考虑考虑。过几天我到山里去看一看，就可以知道得更多一些了。” 吉丁·史佩莱不开口了。虽然火山在爆炸，而且爆炸得愈来愈猛烈，虽然爆炸的回声传遍荒岛，但是不大的工夫，“花岗石宫”的居民们就进入梦乡了。 1月4日、5日、6日，三天过去了。造船的工作辛勤地继续着。工程师没有进一步说明什么，只是投入全副精力来加紧工作。这时候富兰克林山上覆盖着一片阴暗而险恶的烟雾，烈焰里喷出一些白热的岩石，有的喷出来以后，又掉到火山口里去了。老拿这件事开玩笑的潘克洛夫瞧见以后，不禁喊道： “啊，这个大家伙在耍剑球啦！它是一个魔术家。” 喷出来的物质又掉进深渊去了。从这一点来看，虽然内部的压力已经使岩浆上涨起来，似乎还没有升到齐火山口那么高。面向东北的缺口有一部分是可以望得见的，至少它还没有向北部山坡流岩浆。 造船的任务十分紧急，但是荒岛各处其他的工作移民们也不能不做。首先他们必须到畜栏去，因为摩弗仑羊和山羊都圈养在那里，必须给它们补充饲料。大家决定让艾尔通第二天——1月7日——到那里去。畜栏里的工作他是熟悉的，并且他一个人也忙得过来，可是这时候潘克洛夫和其他的人却意外地听见工程师对艾尔通说： “既然你要到畜栏去，我陪你一起去吧。” “可是，史密斯先生，”水手叫道，“我们的工作期限很近了，你再一走，我们就少两个人了！” “我们明天就回来，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我是非到畜栏去不可的。我要了解一下火山爆发得怎么样了。” “火山爆发！老是火山爆发！”潘克洛夫带着不满意的表情说。“不错，火山爆发是一件大事！可是我就不在乎。” 不管水手有什么意见，工程师预定第二天到畜栏去的事情还是决定了。赫伯特要跟赛勒斯·史密斯一起去，但是工程师不愿意引起潘克洛夫更大的不高兴，就作罢了。 第二天天一亮，赛勒斯·史密斯和艾尔通就跳上了两匹野驴拉的大车，飞快地奔向畜栏去了。 大片的烟雾从森林上飘过，富兰克林山的火山口不断往烟里添加烟垢。这些弥漫在空中的浓烟显然包含着各种杂质。它们那种奇怪的不透明的颜色和重量，并不是单纯从火山里得来的。在这些浓烟里，还悬浮着浮石粉似的尘状岩烬以及和最细微的淀粉粒一样的灰色尘埃。这些尘埃非常轻微，往往能在空中飘荡好几个月。1783年冰岛的火山爆发以后，一年多之内大气里还弥漫着火山的灰烬，连太阳光都不容易透过来。 但是，这种粉状的物质还是下降的时候多。现在就是这种情形。赛勒斯·史密斯和艾尔通快到畜栏的时候，天空忽然下了一阵象细火药面似的“黑雪”，地面上立刻变了样。树木、草场都不见了，上面盖着一层几寸厚的烟灰。幸亏这时候刮着东北风，浓烟大部分都被驱到海上去了。 “真奇怪，史密斯先生。”艾尔通说。 “情况很严重，”工程师说。“这种浮石粉和所有这些矿物质的灰尘说明火山底层正在发生着重大的激变。” “没有办法可想吗？” “除了观察情况发展以外，没有其他的办法。因此，艾尔通，你在畜栏里照常做你的工作，我要上红河发源地那边去一趟，观察一下北山坡的情况。然后……” “然后怎么样，史密斯先生？” “然后我们就去探索达卡洞。我要去看看那里的情况。总之，两个钟头之内我一定回来。” 于是艾尔通就到畜栏里去了。他一面等工程师，一面忙着照料摩弗仑羊和山羊。羊群在火山爆发最初的朕兆之下，都感到有些不安。 这时候赛勒斯·史密斯爬上东部支脉的顶峰，经过红河，来到他们第一次旅行时发现硫磺泉的地点。 事情变得多厉害啊！现在他看见的烟不是一股，而是十三股。这些烟往外播送，好象地底下有活塞在猛烈推动似的。地球的这部分地壳显然遭到了惊人的压力。大气里充满了各种气体，还有和水蒸气混合在一起的碳酸气。这一带平地上所铺的火山凝灰岩，是长期以来由岩烬的粉末凝结而成的硬石块。赛勒斯·史密斯觉得脚下的凝灰岩在颤动，但是他并没有发现新的岩浆。 工程师把富兰克林山的整个北山坡全看过以后，没有岩浆这一点是更加肯定了。火山口里冲出许多火柱和烟柱。一阵岩烬象雹子似的降落在地上。但是岩浆并没有涌出火山口，这说明火山物质还没有上涨到中央管口的最上方。 “可是我宁可让岩浆漫出来，”赛勒斯·史密斯自言自语地说。“那样至少就可以知道岩浆是在从老路往外流了。要不然谁敢说它们不会另开一条新路呢？但是危险并不在那儿！尼摩船长事先已经看清这一点了！不，危险不在那儿！” 赛勒斯·史密斯向广阔的堤道走去，堤道延长下去的地方是鲨鱼湾的外围。现在他可以在这边仔细观察古代岩浆流经的路径。他完全可以肯定，最近一次火山爆发已喷是很久以前的事了。 然后，他又从原路回去。一路上他仔细倾听地下的隆隆声，偶尔有几下震耳的爆炸打断这种经久不停的沉雷声。早上九点钟，他回到了畜栏。 艾尔通正在等他。 “牲口已经照料妥了，史密斯先生。”艾尔通说。 “好，艾尔通。” “它们好象很不安稳，史密斯先生。” “是的，这是直觉向它们报警，直觉是决不会欺骗它们的。” “你准备好了吗？” “带一盏灯，艾尔通，”工程师说，“我们马上就走。” 艾尔通照他的话做了。他们卸下野驴的缰绳，让它们在畜栏里游荡。赛勒斯·史密斯带领着艾尔通，从外面关了门，然后走上通往西岸的羊肠小道。 他们走过的土地布满了浓烟里掉下来的尘埃。森林里没有野兽，甚至连鸟类也飞走了。有时候微风扬起铺在地上的烟灰，把他们包围在尘土的漩涡里，彼此互相都看不见。为了免得被烟灰迷了眼睛和呛住嗓子，他们小心地用手帕捂住两眼和口腔。 有了这种障碍，赛勒斯·史密斯和艾尔通是不可能走得很快的。再加上空气闷塞，似乎已经燃烧去一部分氧气，不适合呼吸了。每走一百步，他们就不得不停下来喘息一会儿。因此，等工程师和他的伙伴来到由庞大的玄武岩和斑岩形成的荒岛西北岸山石顶峰的时候，已经是十点多钟了。 艾尔通和赛勒斯·史密斯开始往陡坡下面走去。他们几乎每一步都按照那个狂风暴雨的夜晚所走的通向达卡洞的险路。这次是大白天，下坡不象上次那么危险；并且冲刷过的岩石上还铺了一层烟尘，因此脚步要稳得多。 他们很快就来到了海岸尽头高约四十英尺的分水线。赛勒斯·史密斯记得这道高耸的分水线是逐渐倾斜到海面去的。虽然这时候潮水很低，但是还看不见海滩。冲击着玄武岩石块的波涛非常混浊，那是由于掺杂了火山烟垢的缘故。 赛勒斯·史密斯和艾尔通顺利地找到了达卡洞的入口。他们在洞口前的最后一块岩石旁边停留了一会。 “铁皮小船应该是在那一面。”工程师说。 “在这儿呢，史密斯先生。”艾尔通一面说，一面把保存在拱门底下的轻便小船拉过来。 “上船，艾尔通！” 他们跨上小船。微微起伏的波浪把它送到洞窟的很低的拱门底下。艾尔通在这里用火刀火石点着了灯，他把灯放在船头，使灯光往前照，然后拿起桨来。赛勒斯·史密斯掌着舵，向阴暗的洞窟里驶去。 诺第留斯号不再用它的电光照耀洞窟了。船上的电灯光也许还没有灭，但是却没有一线光亮从尼摩船长长眠的深渊里透到上面来。 灯光虽然微弱，但是还能照引着工程师沿洞窟的石壁慢慢前进。在穹窿底下——至少是在靠外面的这一部分——是死一般的寂静。可是再往里走一会儿，赛勒斯·史密斯就清晰地听到火山内部传来的隆隆声了。 “那是从火山里传来的。”工程师说。 除了这种声音之外，他们很快又闻到一种强烈的气味，一闻到这种味道就知道这里在起着化学变化。这种带有硫磺味的水蒸气几乎使工程师和他的伙伴透不过气来。 “尼摩船长顾虑的就是这个，”赛勒斯·史密斯喃喃地说，他的脸色变了。“不过，我们还是要到洞底去。” “往前走！”艾尔通一面说，一面弯腰拾起双桨，把小船划向洞窟的尽头。 进洞二十五分钟以后，小船来到了洞窟深处。 这时候赛勒斯·史密斯站起来，把灯光投在石壁上。这一堵石壁隔开了洞窟和火山的中央管道。石壁有多厚呢？也许有十英尺，也许有一百英尺——那没法估计。但是地底下火山的响声太清楚了，估计石壁是不会有多厚的。 工程师察看了石壁的下部以后，又把灯绑在桨上，察看高处的玄武岩石壁。 就在这里，石壁上有许多不容易看清的缝隙，一种刺鼻的水蒸气从缝隙里钻出来，散布在洞窟的空气里。石壁上还有几处很大的裂缝，有的一直往下裂到离水面只有二三英尺的地方。 赛勒斯·史密斯沉吟了一会儿，然后低声说： “是的！船长说得对！危险就在这里，这个危险太可怕了！” 艾尔通一句话也没有说。赛勒斯·史密斯做了一个手势，他又划起桨来。半个钟头以后，他和工程师又回到达卡洞口来了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2927.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious
