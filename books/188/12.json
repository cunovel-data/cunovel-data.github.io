{"id":5822,"no":12,"title":"Book 1 Chapter 12","content":"They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater, they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.\\n\\n That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.\\n\\n As to the engineer\u0027s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time which he had passed on the downs.\\n\\n The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun that it must be about nine o\u0027clock in the morning, he put his watch at that hour.\\n\\n \"No, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you not?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Cyrus.\"\\n\\n \"Consequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is almost that of Washington?\"\\n\\n \"Undoubtedly.\"\\n\\n \"Very well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very, exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.\\n\\n \"What will be the good of that?\" thought the sailor.\\n\\n They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no difficulty in that.\\n\\n On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so magnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably had its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange of their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very boyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,\\n\\n \"Hey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!\"\\n\\n It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers should not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he put into his pocket, without making any remark.\\n\\n \"What can he be picking up?\" muttered Pencroft. \"I have looked in vain for anything that\u0027s worth the trouble of stooping for.\"\\n\\n Towards ten o\u0027clock the little band descended the last declivities of Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and trees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood. Great blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very confused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava, which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter, my boy?\" asked Spilett.\\n\\n \"Smoke,\" replied Herbert. \"We have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred paces from us.\"\\n\\n \"Men in this place?\" cried the reporter.\\n\\n \"We must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to deal,\" replied Cyrus Harding. \"I trust that there are no natives on this island; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?\"\\n\\n \"Top is on before.\"\\n\\n \"And he doesn\u0027t bark?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"That is strange. However, we must try to call him back.\"\\n\\n In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the heaps of basalt.\\n\\n From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the air.\\n\\n Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter, signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward. They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor which impregnated the atmosphere.\\n\\n The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.\\n\\n \"This fue,\" said he, \"or rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone. There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.\"\\n\\n \"Captain!\" cried Pencroft. \"What a pity that I haven\u0027t got a cold!\"\\n\\n The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.\\n\\n Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch. He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,--\\n\\n \"Its quite simple, my boy,\" said he, \"for, in plunging my hand into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.\"\\n\\n The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some hundred paces off.\\n\\n There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse.\\n\\n It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over the sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance, in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling than the Chimneys.\\n\\n As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April, which represents the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they were still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which were also covered with the high grass called \"tussac\" in New Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless, being too low.\\n\\n \"What a pity!\" said Herbert, \"such a useful tree, and which has such beautiful nuts!\"\\n\\n As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings. Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors, kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories, and various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism, fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped from the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily, they found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as mountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening\u0027s dinner.\\n\\n Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings, some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at Port- Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and magpies which flew away in flocks.\\n\\n A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and these primitive weapons proved very insufficient.\\n\\n Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to another like squirrels.\\n\\n \"Kangaroos!\" cried Herbert.\\n\\n \"Are they good to eat?\" asked Pencroft.\\n\\n \"Stewed,\" replied the reporter, \"their flesh is equal to the best venison!--\"\\n\\n Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor, followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus Harding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters to pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a chase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more successful than his masters.\\n\\n \"Captain,\" said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had rejoined them, \"Captain, you see quite well we can\u0027t get on unless we make a few guns. Will that be possible?\"\\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" replied the engineer, \"but we will begin by first manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don\u0027t doubt that you will become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.\"\\n\\n \"Bows and arrows!\" said Pencroft scornfully. \"That\u0027s all very well for children!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be proud, friend Pencroft,\" replied the reporter. \"Bows and arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood. Powder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human race--unhappily.\"\\n\\n \"Faith, that\u0027s true, Mr. Spilett,\" replied the sailor, \"and I always speak too quickly. You must excuse me!\"\\n\\n Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History, reverted to the kangaroos, saying,--\\n\\n \"Besides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most difficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not mistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat kangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there are about a dozen species.\"\\n\\n \"Herbert,\" replied the sailor sententiously, \"there is only one species of kangaroos to me, that is \u0027kangaroo on the spit,\u0027 and it\u0027s just the one we haven\u0027t got this evening!\"\\n\\n They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft\u0027s new classification. The honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him.\\n\\n In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even probable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none would be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account; but Neb watched him and he did well.\\n\\n Towards three o\u0027clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten seconds later would have been past recognizing in Top\u0027s stomach. But fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he was devouring, two other rodents--the animals in question belonged to that order--lay strangled on the turf.\\n\\n Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand. Their size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled with green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.\\n\\n The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these rodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their congeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long ears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the agouti.\\n\\n \"Hurrah!\" cried Pencroft, \"the roast has arrived! and now we can go home.\"\\n\\n The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuannas, banksias, and gigantic gum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other arborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the stream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.\\n\\n Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that they would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a thick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.\\n\\n The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place was well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed in a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain of verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of sea. The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp outline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores of this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several couples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching for fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and reappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre.\\n\\n As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other on the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.\\n\\n \"This lake is really beautiful!\" said Gideon Spilett. \"We could live on its borders!\"\\n\\n \"We will live there!\" replied Harding.\\n\\n The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way, descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the lake\u0027s bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path through the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the hand of mm, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at the north of Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction, and then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the plateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.\\n\\n To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by the first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how and where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards the north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and doubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short, an immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so, the engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one. They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding had not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist somewhere.\\n\\n It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.\\n\\n The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which they did great justice.\\n\\n The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,--\\n\\n \"My friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations.\"\\n\\n 林肯岛的居民向周围看了最后一眼，就爬下火山口，绕过火山锥，大约半小时之后，他们就到了昨晚过夜的高地，潘克洛夫觉得已经是吃早饭的时候了，于是他们就想到应当把通讯记者的表和工程师的表对一下。\\n\\n 吉丁·史佩莱的表没有被海水侵入，因为他是降落在海水冲不到的沙滩上。这是一件精良的用品，一只非常完好的怀表，通讯记者每天都忘不了小心地给它上发条。工程师的表是在他到沙丘上的那一段时间内停的。\\n\\n 现在工程师给他的表上足了发条，根据太阳的高度确定大概是早上九点钟，于是就把表对在这个时间上。\\n\\n 吉丁·史佩莱也打算按当地时间对表，可是工程师拦住他的手说：\\n\\n “不，亲爱的史佩莱，等一会儿。你的表是里士满的时间，是不是？”\\n\\n “是的，赛勒斯。”\\n\\n “那么说，你表上的时间是根据里士满的子午线确定的。而里士满和华盛顿的子午线又几乎是一样的，对不对？”\\n\\n “当然。”\\n\\n “很好，就保持这样吧。每天记住给它上发条，可是不要拨表上的针。这对我们也许有用的。”\\n\\n “这有什么用处？”水手暗自想道。\\n\\n 他们痛痛快快地吃了一顿，余下的野味和松子全都吃光了。可是潘克洛夫一点也不愁，他们可以一路补充的。给托普吃的一份非常合乎它的胃口，它会在灌木丛中找到新鲜的野味。水手还想要工程师制造一两支猎枪和一些火药，他认为这对工程师讲来一点儿也不困难。\\n\\n 下了高地以后，工程师向伙伴们提议不从原路回“石窟”，而另选一条新路。他想视察一下在树木环抱中的美丽的格兰特湖。于是他们沿着一个支脉的山脊走去，聚成格兰特湖的细流，大概就是从这些支脉之间发源的。居民们在谈话当中已经用新地名了，这些地名大大便利了他们互相表达意思。年轻的赫伯特和天真的潘克洛夫都入了迷，水手一面走一面说：\\n\\n “嘿，赫伯特！听起来真顺耳！我们不会再走失了，孩子，不管是朝着格兰特湖方向走，还是沿着慈悲河穿过远西森林，我们都一定能走到眺望岗，然后可以到达联合湾！”\\n\\n 大家一致同意，一定等聚齐了再走，决不单独走开。海岛的密林里一定有凶猛可怕的野兽，为了谨慎起见，应该严加提防。在一般的情况下，总是潘克洛夫、赫伯特和纳布开路，托普在前面带领着大家，每一簇树木之间它都要去钻一钻，通讯记者和工程师并肩走着，吉丁·史佩莱随时准备记录发生的事情，工程师经常很少说话，有时候独自走开去捡些东西，也许是矿物，也许是植物，他总是不言不语地把捡来的东西放在口袋里。\\n\\n “他在捡些什么呢？”潘克洛夫喃喃地说。“我找来找去也没发现有值得弯腰去捡的东西。”\\n\\n 将近十点钟的时候，小队跨下了富兰克林山的最后一级山坡。这里的树木还很稀疏。他们走过一片黄色的石灰质地面，这种土壤形成一块几乎长达一英里的平原，一直伸展到森林的边缘。大块的玄武岩——根据毕斯可夫的学说，需要经过三亿五千万年，这种岩石才能冷却——散布在平原各处，分布得非常不规则。可是北部山坡上特有的熔岩，这里却一点也没有。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯打算一路上平安无事地到达小河的源头，他以为小河发源于平原边缘的森林脚下；这时候他忽然看见赫伯特急忙忙地往回跑，纳布和水手躲在岩石后面。\\n\\n “怎么了，孩子？”史佩莱问道。\\n\\n “烟，”赫伯特回答说。“我们看见离我们一百步远的地方石头丛里往上冒烟。”\\n\\n “这儿有人？”通讯记者喊道。\\n\\n “在不知道对方的来历以前，我们决不能暴露自己，”赛勒斯·史密斯答道。“我认为这个岛上是没有土人的，我最怕遇见他们。托普上哪儿去了？”\\n\\n “托普在前面呢。”\\n\\n “它没有叫吗？”\\n\\n “没有。”\\n\\n “奇怪。可是我们应该想法子把它叫回来。”\\n\\n 工夫不大，工程师、吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特就和他们的另外两个伙伴聚在一起了，他们也照样藏在玄武岩的石堆后面。\\n\\n 从那里他们清清楚楚地看见一缕黄烟升向天空。\\n\\n 托普的主人轻轻地吹了一声口哨，把托普喊了回来，他向伙伴们做了一个手势，叫他们等着他，然后就从岩石中悄悄地溜出去了。移民们一动也不动地等待着探听的结果，等得很不耐烦，这时候忽然听见工程师喊了一声，于是他们都急忙向前冲去。他们很快就来到他的跟前，只觉得空气中弥漫着一股触鼻的臭气。\\n\\n 工程师乍看见烟的时候吃了一惊，这并不是毫无理由的，可是这股烟味很容易辨别，他一闻就猜到它的来源了。\\n\\n “这个火，”他说，“或者说这股烟，完全是自然界产生出来的。那儿有一个硫磺泉，如果我们喉咙痛，一治就好了。”\\n\\n “史密斯先生！”潘克洛夫喊道。“可惜我没有伤风！”\\n\\n 于是居民们就向着浓烟上升的地方走去。他们看见那里有一个硫磺泉从岩石之间涌出来，泉水吸收了空气中的氧气以后，散发出一股强烈的硫酸味。\\n\\n 赛勒斯·史密斯把手伸到泉水里去，觉得泉水滑腻腻的。他尝了一下，味道相当甜。水的温度他估计有华氏九十五度。赫伯特问他根据什么计算出水的温度来的。\\n\\n “很简单，孩子，”他说，“因为当我把手伸到水里去的时候，我既不觉得烫，又不觉得凉。所以它的温度和人的体温差不多，而人的体温就在九十五度左右。”\\n\\n 硫磺泉对居民们并没有什么实际用途，于是他们就向着几百步以外的密林边缘走去了。\\n\\n 果然不出他们所料，清澈的河水就是从这里流出来的。小河的两岸很高，都是红土，这种颜色说明土壤里含有氧化铁。根据这个土色，他们马上把小河命名为红河。\\n\\n 这其实是一条大河，河水又深又清，是由山涧水汇合而成的，它半象河水，半象奔流，有时候安静地流过砂石，潺潺作响，有时候冲击在岩石上，或者是从高处直泻下来，形成一个瀑布，从这里流向格兰特湖，长达一英里半以上，宽三十到四十英尺。这条河是淡水，湖里的水想来也是这样的。如果能在湖边找到一个比“石窟”更合适的住所就好了。\\n\\n 水河流出几百英尺以外，两岸有许多树木遮盖着，这些树木多半是美国和塔斯马尼亚温带地区常见的品种，而不是他们在离眺望岗几英里一带探索时所见的松柏科。这时候正是四月初，相当于北半球的十月，也就是初秋，树木的枝叶还很茂盛。林中主要是柽柳和有加利树，其中有的到明年就会产生一种香甜的甘露蜜，和东方的甘露蜜差不多。倾斜的河岸上丛生着澳洲杉，地面还覆盖着一种很高的草，新荷兰把它叫做“袜草”；然而太平洋各群岛盛产的椰子这里却没有，毫无疑问，这是由于纬度太低了。\\n\\n “真可惜！”赫伯特说，“那么有用的树，果实又那么好！”\\n\\n 飞鸟群集在有加利树和柽柳的疏疏落落的枝杈之间，树枝完全没有遮住它们的翅膀。黑的、白的和灰色的美冠鹦鹉、五颜六色的长尾鹦鹉、浑身闪耀着绿色光泽的红头鱼狗、蓝鹦鹉，以及周围其他各种花花绿绿的飞禽，就好象万花筒似的。它们一面拍着翅膀，一面叽叽喳喳的乱叫，几乎把耳朵都吵聋了。突然，丛林中仿佛举行了一个奇怪的合奏，许多不和谐的声音一齐响了起来。居民们先后听到鸟叫声、野兽吼声，还有一种好象是土人嘴里发出来的声音。纳布和赫伯特向灌木丛冲去，连“必须小心戒备”的最基本原则都忘记了。好在他们在那里既没有发现凶猛的野兽，也没有发现可怕的土人，只看见六只善于模仿各种叫声的鸣禽，也就是所谓山雉。一根棍子准确地打了几下，它们的合奏马上中断了，居民们可以用它们做一顿上好的晚餐。\\n\\n 赫伯特还发现一些美丽的鸽子，它们有的长着青铜色的翅膀，有的长着华丽的冠毛，有的浑身碧绿，很象麦加利港的鸽子，可是要想捉住它们是不可能的，还有那些成群飞翔的乌鸦和喜鹊也同样没法捕捉。\\n\\n 只要有支猎枪，一枪就可以打死它们一大群，可是猎人们手头的投掷武器只有石头，当作枪的只是棍子，这些原始武器实在不能满足打猎的需要。\\n\\n 一会儿又有一群动物在丛林里跑了过去，它们连跑带跳，一跃就是三十英尺，是一种真正的“飞兽”，跳得既快又高，看起来简直和松鼠一样，从一棵树上跳到另外一棵树上；这时候居民们更觉得武器不中用了。\\n\\n “袋鼠！”赫伯特喊道。\\n\\n “好吃吗？”潘克洛夫问道。\\n\\n “袋鼠肉啊，”通讯记者说，“炖好了就能抵得过最好的腊味！……”\\n\\n 吉丁·史佩莱这句诱惑人心的话还没有说完，水手就带领着纳布和赫伯特向袋鼠赶去了。赛勒斯·史密斯想把他们喊回来，可是白费力气。这种灵敏的动物看见人来，就象皮球似的跳走了，猎人要想追赶它们，同样也是白费力气。他们赶了五分钟，连气也喘不过来，袋鼠却全部钻入了森林，一只也看不见了。托普比起它的主人们来，也不见得更有办法些。\\n\\n “史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫等工程师和通讯记者走来以后说，“你看！非造几支枪不可了，你说造得了造不了？”\\n\\n “也许可能，”工程师答道，“可是我们第一步先要制造一些弓箭，我相信你一定能使用得和澳洲的猎人一样娴熟的。”\\n\\n “弓箭！”潘克洛夫不屑地说。“那是孩子们的玩意儿！”\\n\\n “不要骄傲，我的潘克洛夫先生，”通讯记者说。“多少世纪以来，就是弓箭使大地染上了鲜血。火药只不过是不久以前才有的，可是战争呢——不幸得很，可以说有人类以来就有了！”\\n\\n “不错，说得对，史佩莱先生，”水手说，“我说话老是不加考虑。请你原谅。”\\n\\n 赫伯特一向对他所喜欢的博物学有兴趣，这时候他又回到袋鼠的话题上去了：\\n\\n “并且，我们现在要对付的又是最难捉的一种，这是一种大袋鼠，长着灰色的长毛；假如我没有记错的话，那么还有黑的和红的袋鼠，岩石袋鼠和鼷，那些袋鼠捉起来比较容易。据统计大概有十二种……”\\n\\n “赫伯特，”水手直截了当地说，“据我看来，袋鼠只有一种，那就是‘肉叉上的袋鼠’，我们今天晚上偏偏没有捉住！”\\n\\n 他们听了潘克洛夫的新分类法以后，止不住大笑起来。晚上只好吃山雉了，忠实的水手毫不掩饰他心中的遗憾，可是他居然又遇到了一次幸事。\\n\\n 托普为了它本身的利益，到处去搜索，它肚子愈饿，直觉就加倍地灵敏。如果托普私自去打猎的话，恐怕不论是什么野味，只要落在它的爪牙之下，丝毫也不会剩给猎人们；可是现在纳布监视着它，它只好老老实实。\\n\\n 将近三点钟的时候，它钻到灌木丛里不见了，一阵低低的咆哮声说明它在和什么动物揪打。纳布跟着它冲进去，马上就看见托普在拼命地吞食一只小动物，再晚去十秒钟，这只小动物就要整个被它咽下肚去了。幸而托普攻击的是一窝，除了它吃掉了的以外，还有两只啮齿动物（这些动物都属于这一类）软瘫在草地上。\\n\\n 纳布一手提着一只胜利地回来了。它们比兔子稍微大一些，浑身长着黄毛，上面夹杂着绿色的斑点，尾巴退化得剩下短短的一点。\\n\\n 这种啮齿动物的正确名称并没有把这些美国公民难住。它们是刺鼠的一种，叫做“马拉”，比热带地区的同种和美国常见的兔子稍大一些，长着一对长耳朵，和刺鼠不同的是：嘴里一边长着五个臼齿。\\n\\n “哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道，“烤肉来了！我们可以回家了。”\\n\\n 他们停了一会儿又继续往前走。柽柳、山茂和高大的橡胶树形成一个拱门，清澈的红河从下面流过。美丽的丁香树高达二十英尺，还有许多是年轻的自然学家不知道的树木。它们低垂在小河上，河水在夹岸的绿荫下潺潺作响。\\n\\n 这里的河面宽得多了，赛勒斯·史密斯估计他们不久就要到达河口。果然，当他们从一丛美丽的密林下钻出来的时候，就发现已经到了尽头。\\n\\n 探险家们来到格兰特湖的西岸。这里的景色很值得观赏。湖的周围约有七英里，面积在二百五十英亩左右，湖边生长着各种树木。东边几处较高的湖岸有一道美丽如画的苍翠屏障，透过屏障可以看见一线海洋闪闪发光。湖岸的北边显得曲折有致，和南部峻峭的轮廓形成鲜明的对比。这个小小的安大略湖湖畔经常栖息着许多水禽，离南岸几百英尺的湖面有许多岩石露出水来，它们相当于安大略湖里的“千岛”。几对鱼狗和睦地群居在那里，一动也不动地停在一块石头上，静静地期待着游鱼，只要一有发现，就尖叫一声，钻入水底，紧跟着就衔着猎获物出来。岸上和小岛上有许多水禽在大摇大摆地走着，其中有野鸭、塘鹅、水鸡、红嘴鸟、舌头象刷子的水鸟和一两只美丽的琴鸟——它们鲜艳的尾巴张开来，就象“里拉”一样。\\n\\n 这是一个淡水湖，湖水颜色很深，但也很清澈，水面上常常有几处泛起水泡，无数的涟漪一圈圈地荡漾开来，然后又彼此碰在一起，可见水底下游鱼是不会少的。\\n\\n “这个湖真美！”吉丁·史佩莱说。“我们最好就住在湖滨一带！”\\n\\n “我们会住在这儿的！”史密斯说。\\n\\n 居民们打算选一条最近的路回“石窟”去，就朝着湖岸南边的拐角处往下走。这里的灌木和丛林从来也不曾有人走过，要想从里面开出一条路来可不简单。他们就这样向海岸走去，打算直到眺望岗的北边。他们披荆斩棘，朝着这个方向前进了两英里，穿过最后一带树木，高地就呈现在他们的眼前了。高地上铺着一层厚厚的绿茵，再向前就是一望无际的海洋。\\n\\n 要想回“石窟”，只要斜穿高地走一英里，然后往下走到慈悲河的第一个拐角处就到了。然而工程师想了解一下湖水涨满了以后是从哪里泄出和怎样泄出去的，于是他们就穿过树木，继续在北探索了一英里半。附近一带大概有瀑布，而且无疑是从花岗石缝中倾泻下去的。简单地说，这个湖是一个极大的中心盆地，小河的流水逐渐把它灌满，湖水必然会形成瀑布流向大海。如果真是这样，工程师认为也许可以利用瀑布的力量，要不然这股水力也是白白地浪费掉。他们于是爬上高地，继续沿着格兰特湖前进，可是循着这个方向走了一英里，赛勒斯·史密斯还是没有发现这个必然存在的瀑布。\\n\\n 这时候已经四点半了。为了准备晚餐，居民们必须回到家里去。于是小队折回原路，沿着慈悲河的左岸回到了“石窟”。\\n\\n 篝火生起来了。纳布和潘克洛夫一向是负责烹调的——一个是黑人，一个是水手，都有这种本领——很快就烤好了一些刺鼠肉，大家都尽情地饱餐了一顿。\\n\\n 晚饭终于吃完了。大家正打算睡觉，赛勒斯·史密斯突然从口袋里拿出几小块不同样的矿石来，他简单地说：\\n\\n “朋友们，这是铁矿石，这是黄铁矿石，这是陶土，这是石灰石，这是煤。自然界把这些东西供给了我们。能不能好好地利用它们就在我们自己了。明天我们就开始工作。”\\n\\n \\n\\n
