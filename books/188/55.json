{"id":5865,"no":55,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 13","content":"How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for a moment before he was dreading their return. But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed. The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton\u0027s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken place before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separation. Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as much as he knew. The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November, at nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the palisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern, at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge. His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were about to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by the name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to murdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce! But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his former accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the island, after murdering the colonists! Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned, would rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton--bound, gagged, and closely watched--lived in this cave for four months. Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after their arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on Ayrton\u0027s stores, but did not live at the corral. On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the colonists\u0027 arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned alone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding\u0027s dagger. Ayrton\u0027s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of Herbert\u0027s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert\u0027s illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent to abandon it. The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and night. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear possible that he could escape. Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts, still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their retreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior of the island, or the south coast. Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope of ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened by ill- treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and hearing failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two days, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred. \"But, Captain Harding,\" he added, \"since I was imprisoned in that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?\" \"How is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the enclosure?\" answered the engineer. \"Dead!\" cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his weakness. His companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their assistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little stream. It was now broad daylight. There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken by death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five convicts! Ayrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without uttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined the bodies, already stiffened by the cold. They bore no apparent trace of any wound. Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of one, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder of that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause of which it was impossible to conjecture. \"It is there that they have been struck!\" said Cyrus Harding. \"But with what weapon?\" cried the reporter. \"A weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the secret!\" \"And who has struck the blow?\" asked Pencroft. \"The avenging power of the island,\" replied Harding, \"he who brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will accomplished, conceals himself from us.\" \"Let us make search for him, then!\" exclaimed Pencroft. \"Yes, we will search for him,\" answered Harding, \"but we shall not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases to call us to him!\" This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing, both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity evinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding\u0027s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit. \"Let us search,\" he resumed, \"and God grant that we may some day be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal with ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some signal service!\" From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree superhuman power. In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground. Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during his seclusion. He learned Herbert\u0027s adventures, and through what various trials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered him. \"And now,\" said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, \"a duty remains for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that we are once more masters of the island.\" \"Well!\" answered Gideon Spilett, \"let us search all this labyrinth of the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!\" \"And we will not return to Granite House until we have found our benefactor,\" said Herbert. \"Yes,\" said the engineer, \"we will do all that it is humanly possible to do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.\" \"Shall we stay at the corral?\" asked Pencroft. \"We shall stay here,\" answered Harding. \"Provisions are abundant, and we are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides, if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.\" \"Good!\" answered the sailor. \"Only I have a remark to make.\" \"What is it?\" \"Here is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have a voyage to make.\" \"A voyage?\" said Gideon Spilett. \"Yes, to Tabor Island,\" answered Pencroft. \"It is necessary to carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows if it is not already too late?\" \"But, Pencroft,\" asked Ayrton, \"how do you intend to make this voyage?\" \"In the \u0027Bonadventure.\u0027\" \"The \u0027Bonadventure!\u0027\" exclaimed Ayrton. \"She no longer exists.\" \"My \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 exists no longer!\" shouted Pencroft, bounding from his seat. \"No,\" answered Ayrton. \"The convicts discovered her in her little harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her--\" \"And?\" said Pencroft, his heart beating. \"And not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the vessel went to pieces.\" \"Oh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!\" exclaimed Pencroft. \"Pencroft,\" said Herbert, taking the sailor\u0027s hand, \"we will build another \u0027Bonadventure\u0027--a larger one. We have all the ironwork--all the rigging of the brig at our disposal.\" \"But do you know,\" returned Pencroft, \"that it will take at least five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?\" \"We can take our time,\" said the reporter, \"and we must give up the voyage to Tabor Island for this year.\" \"Oh, my \u0027Bonadventure!\u0027 my poor \u0027Bonadventure!\u0027\" cried Pencroft, almost broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so proud. The loss of the \"Bonadventure\" was certainly a thing to be lamented by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired as soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with bringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the island. The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and lasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and their numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the proper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown. But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner. The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and in which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This cavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts in order to form a reserve. The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and other trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the picturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer. Stones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the rocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be seen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount Franklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became rivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern part. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the Serpentine Peninsula was watered. Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary for life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had they discovered the presence of man. Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of lava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found? The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of two valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation, strewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great blocks of mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration. It contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly concealed and difficult of access. The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic period, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into the depths of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries, waving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they sounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did not appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient passages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of the island. However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that absolute silence did not reign there. On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear a deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the rocks. Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant mutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires. Several times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process was taking place in the bowels of the earth. \"Then the volcano is not totally extinct?\" said the reporter. \"It is possible that since our exploration of the crater,\" replied Cyrus Harding, \"some change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered extinct, may evidently again burst forth.\" \"But if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,\" asked Spilett, \"would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?\" \"I do not think so,\" answered the reporter. \"The crater, that is to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.\" \"Unless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts of the island!\" \"And why, my dear Spilett,\" answered Cyrus Harding, \"should it not follow the road naturally traced out for it?\" \"Well, volcanoes are capricious,\" returned the reporter. \"Notice,\" answered the engineer, \"that the inclination of Mount Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain\u0027s center of gravity.\" \"But an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,\" observed Gideon Spilett. \"Always,\" replied the engineer, \"especially when the subterranean forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At any rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would he seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground is considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring parts of Shark Gulf.\" \"We have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate an approaching eruption,\" said Gideon Spilett. \"No,\" answered Harding, \"not a vapor escapes from the crater, for it was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it is probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have accumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which I spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the first serious effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas. Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an eruption.\" \"And yet we are not mistaken,\" remarked the reporter. \"Mutterings can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!\" \"You are right,\" said the engineer, again listening attentively. \"There can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.\" Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to whom they made known the state of affairs. \"Very well!\" cried Pencroft, \"The volcano wants to play his pranks! Let him try, if he likes! He will find his master!\" \"Who?\" asked Neb. \"Our good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him, if he so much as pretends to open it!\" As may be seen, the sailor\u0027s confidence in the tutelary deity of his island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it knew how to escape the colonists\u0027 most minute researches, for, in spite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,--the obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered. From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret nooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every rock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at the bottom of which opened the crater. They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths the rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or vapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption. But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search. Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest, although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf. No one!--nothing! Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly expended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions. It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be prolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural. On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the door, they re-established communication between their habitation and the ground. A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island. 事情是怎么发生的？是谁杀死罪犯的呢？是艾尔通吗？不，刚才他还担心罪犯们会回来呢！ 艾尔通从说完刚才那几句话以后，就失去了知觉。现在他已经完全陷入昏迷状态，一动也不动地躺在床上。 居民们胡思乱想，感到非常纳闷。由于过度的激动，他们在艾尔通的房间里整整等了一夜，再也没有到躺着罪犯们尸体的地方去。大概艾尔通也不能说明这些尸体怎样来的，因为他连自己在畜栏里都不知道。可是，他至少能够叙述一下这个恐怖场面发生以前的情况。第二天，艾尔通从昏迷状态中清醒过来了。分别了一百零四天，他几乎还是安然无恙，伙伴们和他重新见面的时候表现了亲切的喜悦。 艾尔通简短地叙述了事情发生的经过——至少是尽他所知道的一切。 去年11月10日，他来到畜栏的第二天晚上，罪犯们翻过栅栏，向他袭击。他们把他绑起来，堵住他的嘴，然后把他带到富兰克林山麓的一个幽暗的山洞里去，那就是罪犯们的巢穴。 他们已经决定要在第二天把他处死了，恰好这时候有一个罪犯认出了他，并且喊出过去他在澳洲所用的名字。假若是艾尔通，这些匪徒就毫不犹豫地把他杀害了！然而这是彭·觉斯，所以他们把他留下来！ 于是，从那时候起，艾尔通就一再受到老部下的胁迫。他们打算要他重新入伙，依靠他的帮助，打进他们一直没能上去的“花岗石宫”，占据这所住宅，杀死全体移民，做岛上的主人！ 艾尔通的意志是坚定不移的，这个昔日的罪犯，现在已经悔过自新，得到了宽恕；他宁肯牺牲自己，也不愿出卖他的伙伴。艾尔通被绑着身子，堵住嘴，在山洞里监禁了将近四个月。 虽然罪犯们在岛上登陆以后不久就发现了畜栏，并且从那时起，一直依靠艾尔通的物资维持生活，但是他们并没有住在里面。 11月11日，两个匪徒在畜栏里突然发现居民们来了，就向赫伯特开了一枪。其中的一个逃回去了。他向其他的罪犯夸耀，说打死了一个岛上的居民；但他却是一个人回来的。前面已经说过，他的伙伴被赛勒斯·史密斯刺死了。 当艾尔通听到赫伯特牺牲了的消息，他的不安和绝望是可以想象的。现在只剩下四个居民了，而他们似乎还受着罪犯的威胁。这件事情以后，在居民们因赫伯特养伤而耽搁在畜栏里的整个期间，海盗们一直没有离开山洞；甚至在他们劫掠过眺望岗的高地以后，他们为了谨慎起见，还是隐匿在山洞里。 这时候，他们对待艾尔通更加残酷了。由于成天被绑，他的手上和脚上到现在还留着血痕。他要想逃走似乎是不可能的，只有等待着死。 这种情况一直继续到二月份的第三个星期。罪犯们很少离开他们的老窝，仅仅有时到荒岛的内陆或南岸一带去打过几次猎，但是他们心里却无时不在等待机会。 艾尔通以后一直没有听到关于伙伴们的消息，他觉到已经没有任何希望再和他们见面了。最后，经不起种种的虐待，这个不幸的人陷入了虚脱状态，视觉和听觉都严重地减退了。从那时起，也就是说，两天以来，什么情况他都不知道。 “可是，史密斯先生，”他接着说，“既然我被监禁在那个山洞里，我怎么会到畜栏来的呢？” “是啊，罪犯们又怎么会死在栅栏里边的呢？”工程师反问道。 “死了！”艾尔通不顾身体的虚弱，从床上半撑起身来叫道。 伙伴们扶着他。他想要爬起来，在伙伴们的扶持下，艾尔通下了床。于是他们一同向小溪边走去。 这时候天已经大亮了。 就在这里的河岸上，躺着五个罪犯的尸体，他们的样子看来象是被打死不久！ 艾尔通楞住了。史密斯和他的伙伴们默默地望着他。纳布和潘克洛夫根据工程师的手势，去检验尸体。这时候，尸体已经冰冷僵硬了。 尸体上并没有显著的伤痕。 经过仔细的检验，潘克洛夫才发现第一具尸体的额头上，第二具的胸膛上，第三具的脊背上，第四具的肩膀上，各有一个小红点。这是一种很难辨认出来的创伤，究竟怎么来的，却还是猜不透。 “他们就是在这里被打中的！”赛勒斯·史密斯说。 “可是用的是什么武器呢？”通讯记者大声问道。 “一种有着闪电效果的武器，不过我们不知道它的秘密！”史密斯回答说。 “是谁打的呢？”潘克洛夫问道。 “岛上的正义复仇者，”史密斯答道。“艾尔通，你就是被他带到畜栏里来的。他又一次发挥了他的威力。我们自己做不到的，他都替我们做了。他总是在达到目的以后，避开我们。” “那么，我们去找他吧！”潘克洛夫叫道。 “是的，我们要找他，”史密斯说，“可是，在他愿意召见我们以前，我们是没有办法找到这个创造奇迹的伟大人物的！” 居民们在这种肉眼看不见的保佑下面，自己的行动显得一点用处也没有，赛勒斯·史密斯不禁感到又烦恼又着急。这种相形见绌的情况往往会伤害一个人的自尊心的。同时用拒绝别人感恩的方法来表示自己慷慨，这也包含着瞧不起受惠人的成分。因此，在赛勒斯·史密斯看来，反而在某种程度上降低了这一切义举的价值。 “我们去找吧！”他接着说，“但愿有一天我们能够向这位高傲的保卫者证明，我们不是忘恩负义的人！要是我们能够报答他，能够轮到我们为他尽一点点义务，表示表示我们的心意，即使要付出生命的代价，我又有什么理由不答应呢？” 从这天起，林肯岛上的居民就一心一意打算进行这次搜索了。每一件事都激励他们要去寻找这个谜的答案，这个答案只可能是一个确实赋有不可思议的能力——在某种程度上接近超凡——的人的名字。 几分钟以后，居民们回到屋子里来。在大家照料下，艾尔通的精神和体力很快就复原了。 纳布和潘克洛夫把罪犯的尸体运到离畜栏不远的森林里去，把他们埋葬起来。 然后，他们向艾尔通讲述了在他被监禁期间所发生的事情。他这才知道赫伯特遭到的危险和居民们经历的种种灾难。原来居民们已经认为没有希望再和艾尔通重新见面，以为罪犯们残酷地把他杀害了。 “现在，”赛勒斯·史密斯叙述完了以后，接着说，“我们还要办一件事。我们的任务才完成一半。虽然以后可以不再担心罪犯们的骚扰，但是我们这次重新成为岛上的主人却不是依靠自己的力量达到的。” “好吧！”吉丁·史佩莱说，“我们就去搜索富兰克林山支脉一带整个错综复杂的山区吧。我们决不放过一个山沟和洞穴！啊！假如能够发现秘密，朋友们，我就是第一个迎接秘密的通讯记者了！” “如果找不到恩人，我们决不回‘花岗石宫’。”赫伯特说。 “是的，”工程师说，“凡是人力能够达到的，我们都要去做。可是我还要重复一遍，恐怕只有他愿意见我们的时候，我们才能找到他。” “我们就暂时住在畜栏里吗？”潘克洛夫问道。 “是的，”史密斯回答说。“这里粮食很多，又正好是搜查范围的中心。再说，如果有必要回‘花岗石宫’，坐上大车很快就可以到了。” “好！”水手说。“不过我有一个意见。” “什么意见？” “现在好天气一天天过去了，我们不要忘记，还要航海。” “航海？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。 “是啊，到达抱岛去，”潘克洛夫回答说。“也许苏格兰游船就要来接艾尔通回去了。必须送一封信到达抱岛去，说明林肯岛的位置，还要说明艾尔通在这儿。也许现在已经太迟了，那有谁知道呢？” “可是，潘克洛夫，”艾尔通问道，“你打算怎么航海呢？” “用乘风破浪号。” “乘风破浪号！”艾尔通大声说。“早已没有了。” “我的乘风破浪号没有了？”潘克洛夫从坐位上跳起来叫道。 “不错，”艾尔通说。“八天以前，罪犯们才在小港湾里发现它的，他们乘着它航海，后来……” “后来怎么样？”潘克洛夫紧接着追问一句，他的心直跳。 “因为没有鲍勃·哈维掌舵，他们一下子撞在石头上。把船撞碎了。” “啊呀！这些强盗、土匪、不要脸的家伙！”潘克洛夫大骂起来。 “潘克洛夫，”赫伯特拉着他的手说，“我们可以再造一只乘风破浪号，造一只更大的。我们全部铁器都有，双桅船上的整套索具都可以拿来随便使用。” “可是你知道吗，”潘克洛夫说，“一只三四十吨的船，至少要五六个月才能造成呢！” “我们可以想法子利用时间，”通讯记者说，“今年只好不到达抱岛去了。” “有什么办法呢，潘克洛夫！”工程师说。“只好克制自己，冷静一些。但愿晚一点到达抱岛去，对我们不会有什么害处。” “唉，我的乘风破浪号！可怜的乘风破浪号！”潘克洛夫听说一向引以自豪的船遭到毁坏，他的心几乎碎了。 失去了乘风破浪号，对居民们说来，的确是一件值得惋惜的事情。他们一致同意尽速弥补这个损失。这个问题决定以后，他们就要开始在荒岛上最隐蔽的地方进行搜索了。 从2月19日破晓开始，他们出发探险，前后一共经历了一个星期。山麓的支脉和无数的分支形成了错综复杂的谷地和丘陵。这些峡谷的深处——甚至也许连富兰克林山的内部都要包括在内——显然正是他们应该搜索的地方。如果有人打算在岛上找一个别人发现不了的住处，那么到这里来是再适合也没有了。由于这些山谷的地形非常复杂，因此赛勒斯·史密斯只好严格地挨次进行搜查。 居民们首先察看了通向火山南部的山谷，瀑布河一开头就是从这个山谷里流过的。在这里，艾尔通把大家引导到罪犯们藏身的山洞里去。在没有被送回畜栏以前，他就是在这里监禁着的。山洞还是和艾尔通离开的时候一样。他们在里面找到不少火药和粮食，都是罪犯们从别处搬来贮藏在这里的。 山洞附近的山谷有枞树和其他树木覆盖着，他们全部都搜遍了。绕过西南支脉的拐角以后，移民们进入了一条峡谷，这里的景致很象那一带分布着奇形怪状的玄武石柱的海滨。峡谷里的树木比较稀疏，乱石代替了青草。野山羊和摩弗仑羊在岩石间纵跳着。从这一带开始，就是岛上荒芜的地区了。虽然富兰克林山麓向各处分散出的山谷很多，但是已经可以看出，峡谷和畜栏的山谷一样，遍布着树林和大量牧草的只有三条。畜栏的山谷西面靠近瀑布河河谷，东面靠红河河谷。这两股小溪由附近各个山涧会合而成。由于它们的滋润，使得山南一带的土地非常肥沃，溪水流到下游以后，和许多支流会合在一起，才成了河流。慈悲河则是由啄木鸟林中较大的泉水直接会合而成的，这种泉水伸展成无数溪流，使盘蛇半岛的土壤得到了水源。 这三条水量充沛的河谷，哪一条都可以被隐士选为藏身的地方，因为这里有一切的生活必需品。然而居民们搜查遍了，各处都没有发现人的踪影。 那么，这位隐士和他的住所，是不是在那些荒芜的峡谷深处、乱石丛中、崎岖的北部山峡或是熔岩流过的地方呢？ 富兰克林山的北麓只有两条山谷，这两条山谷相当宽阔，却不太深，里面任何草木也看不见，只有铺在谷底的熔岩，零乱地散布着的许多岩石，包括各种火山岩石和大块的矿石。这一带需要较长的时间仔细搜查。这里有成千的洞窟，虽然不适宜居住，但是却非常隐蔽，很难过去。 居民们甚至连阴暗的地道也钻进去看看，一直进入深山。这些地道是从火山爆发时期就存在的。由于在这里喷射过火焰，洞里还保持着被熏黑的一片。他们摇曳着火把，穿过这些黑暗的走廊，连最小的洞隙都一一仔细察看了。他们也探测了那些很浅的地道，然而一切都是阴森森的，这些古老的地道看来一向没有人走过，也没有人移动过一块岩石——岩石都保持着荒岛在海底时火山把它们喷射出水面的样子。 虽然这些地道看起来十分荒凉，非常阴暗，赛勒斯·史密斯却应该承认这里并不是一点声音也没有。 他们走到一个深达几百英尺直通深山内部的阴暗洞底时，工程师忽然听见一种低沉的隆隆声，并且由于有岩石的回响，声音变得更大，这使他感到非常惊讶。 同他在一起的吉丁·史佩莱也听到了这种远处传来的隆隆声，这说明地下的火焰复燃了。他们倾听了很久，都认为地底下正在进行着化学变化。 “那么，火山还没有完全熄灭吗？”通讯记者问道。 “在我们上次探索火山口以后，”赛勒斯·史密斯回答说，“也许又发生了什么变化。任何一座被认为已经熄灭的火山，肯定都会重新爆发的。” “可是，如果富兰克林山爆发起来，”史佩莱问道，“会不会给林肯岛带来危险呢？” “我想是不会的，”赛勒斯·史密斯回答说，“因为火山口就好比安全活门。有了它，烟和岩浆就可以从这里喷出来。过去它们一向就是从这条出口出去的。” “要是岩浆朝着岛上的富饶地区冲出一个新的出口来，情况就不同了！” “亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“为什么你要认为它不走原来的道路呢？” “嗯，火山是捉摸不定的。”通讯记者回答说。 “注意，”工程师说，“富兰克林山的斜度使山涧水往我们现在所探索的山谷这边流，要改变流水的方向，除非发生一次地震，改变山的重心才行。” “可是目前恐怕随时都可能发生地震。”吉丁·史佩莱说。 “随时，”工程师说，“不错，特别是在地下的力量停歇了很久时期，现在刚开始复活，是可能遇到一些障碍的。在这种情况下，亲爱的史佩莱，要是火山爆发起来，就会给我们带来严重的后果了。最好火山根本就没有复活的意思。不过我们是没法阻止它的，是不是？但是，即使真的爆发了，我想眺望岗也不会遭到多大威胁。因为眺望岗和富兰克林山之间的地面相当低，要是岩浆向格兰特湖流过来，它一定会落在中途的沙丘上和鲨鱼湾附近的。” “我们还没有看见山顶上有表明火山快要爆发的烟呢。”吉丁·史佩莱说。 “不错，”史密斯说，“我昨天刚仔细看过山顶，火山口连一丝烟雾也没有。可是经过的时间很长了，喷火口的下部也许会堆积一些石块、岩烬和凝结了的熔岩，这些东西随时都可能因为积累得过多，把我刚才所说的活门堵住。可是，经过第一次猛烈的爆炸以后，一切的障碍就都排除了。我们的荒岛好比锅炉，火山好比烟囱；我敢向你保证，亲爱的史佩莱，到时候它们都不会由于受到气体的压力而爆炸的。不过，我还是这样说，最好火山不要爆发。” “但是我们并没有听错，”通讯记者说。“火山的内部明明在响呢！” “你说得对，”工程师一面说，一面又仔细听了一会。“里面发生了骚动。这是没有疑问的。我们既不能估计它的力量，又没法推测它会造成什么后果。” 赛勒斯·史密斯和史佩莱从地道里出来以后，把这些情况告诉了伙伴们。 “好哇！”潘克洛夫叫道，“火山想作怪了！要是它高兴的话，让它来吧！会有人来制服它的！” “谁！”纳布问道。 “我们那位好心肠的圣人，纳布，就是我们那位好心的圣人，要是火山胆敢开口，他会把它的嘴堵起来的！” 从这件事上可以看出，水手对于这位守护荒岛的神灵的信仰是十分虔诚的。这种神秘的力量，到现在为止，已经发挥过许多次了，而且每一次都有一种莫名其妙的表现方式。的确，他的力量好象是无边无际的。此外，他还懂得怎样逃避移民们最仔细的搜查；尽管他们费尽了心机，尽管他们远征的热情甚至已达到顽强的程度，这个神秘人物的住处还是没法找到。 从2月19日到2月25日，他们搜索了林肯岛的整个北部地区，连最隐蔽的角落也查遍了。居民们甚至一块挨一块地敲打岩石，一直搜查到山的边缘。他们就这样一直来到削平了的火山锥顶，也就是第一行岩石的终点；然后又来到上面“大帽子”的山脊上。“大帽子”的底下就是火山口。 他们所做的还不仅仅是这些。他们察看了深渊。这时候深渊已经没有火，在它的深处却清晰地传来了隆隆的响声。但是，并没有任何迹象可以说明火山将要爆发——既没有烟雾，石头也不烫。至于移民们所找的那个人，不管在这里，还是在富兰克林山的其余部分，都没有发现他的踪迹。 接着，他们就去搜索沙丘。尽管要想到鲨鱼湾的平地都十分困难，他们还是从上到下，仔细地察看了高耸在海湾里的熔岩峭壁。但是，没有人！什么也没有！ 总之，这两句结论说明他们白费气力，徒劳无功，说明赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们失望得甚至有点恼怒了。 现在是应该考虑回家的时候了，因为这种搜索是不能无限期拖下去的。居民们认为这个神秘的人决不住在荒岛的表面上，这一点是肯定的；于是他们不禁想入非非。特别是潘克洛夫和纳布，他们认为这事情不只是神秘，因此他们往超脱凡人以外的境界去想。 2月25日，居民们回到“花岗石宫”里来了。他们利用弓箭，把双股的绳索射到门槛口，恢复了地面和住宅之间的交通。 又过了一个月，在3月25日那天，他们纪念了到林肯岛来的三周年。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2922.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The
