{"id":5845,"no":35,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 13","content":"\"A castaway!\" exclaimed Pencroft; \"left on this Tabor Island not two hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won\u0027t now oppose my going.\" \"No, Pencroft,\" replied Cyrus Harding; \"and you shall set out as soon as possible.\" \"To-morrow?\" \"To-morrow!\" The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed, \"From this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded, we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the latitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or American, as the document is written in the English language.\" \"That is perfectly logical,\" answered Spilett; \"and the presence of this castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island. There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the latter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of building this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and this bottle might have been broken on the rocks.\" \"Indeed,\" said Herbert, \"it is a fortunate chance that the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!\" \"Does not this appear strange to you?\" asked Harding of Pencroft. \"It appears fortunate, that\u0027s all,\" answered the sailor. \"Do you see anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?\" \"Perhaps you are right, Pencroft,\" replied the engineer; \"and yet--\" \"But,\" observed Herbert, \"there\u0027s nothing to prove that this bottle has been floating long in the sea.\" \"Nothing,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"and the document appears even to have been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?\" During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put the vessel about, and the \"Bonadventure,\" all sails set, was running rapidly towards Claw Cape. Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they be in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the colonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared that another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go to his succor. Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o\u0027clock the \"Bonadventure\" dropped her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy. That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made. It appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the vessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day, the 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present wind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage of a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to return, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again reach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising, the wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island. Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett should remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage. The evening was occupied in transporting on board the \"Bonadventure,\" articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions for a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite House. The next day, at five o\u0027clock in the morning, the farewells were said, not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the southwest. The \"Bonadventure\" was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb. \"Our friends,\" exclaimed Spilett, \"this is our first separation in fifteen months.\" Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape. During the first part of the day the \"Bonadventure\" was still in sight of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights, diminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten miles. At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin, and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon. The \"Bonadventure\" behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad\u0027s hand was so firm that the sailor had not a point to find fault with. Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with his crew. In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first quarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The night was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine. Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent sailor and cannot be blamed for it. The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns for a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as he would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman, and Herbert never allowed the \"Bonadventure\" to swerve even a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of October. A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the \"Bonadventure\" fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly within sight of Tabor Island. As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely deserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he had confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the ocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands. \"And yet,\" observed Herbert, \"this is the time that whalers usually proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think there could be a more deserted sea than this.\" \"It is not quite so deserted as all that,\" replied Pencroft. \"What do you mean?\" asked the reporter. \"We are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?\" And Pencroft laughed at his joke. By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the \"Bonadventure\" had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six hours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots an hour. The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether. However, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the calculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor Island. Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion. There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor Island? Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor they had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the little colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to exchange his prison for another? All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon. \"Land!\" shouted Pencroft at about six o\u0027clock in the morning. And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was evident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of the \"Bonadventure.\" In a few hours they would land on the beach of the island! The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not more than fifteen miles distant. The head of the \"Bonadventure,\" which was a little to the south of the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east, its rays fell upon one or two headlands. \"This is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,\" observed Herbert, \"and is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.\" At eleven o\u0027clock the \"Bonadventure\" was not more than two miles off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land, proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum and other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln Island. But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore! And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this castaway should have been on the watch. In the meanwhile the \"Bonadventure\" entered the winding channels among the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail at a moment\u0027s notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving anything. However, at about twelve o\u0027clock the keel of the \"Bonadventure\" grated on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of the little vessel landed. And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since according to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of the Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast. The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of her being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his companions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile. \"From the summit of that hill,\" said Spilett, \"we can no doubt obtain a complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.\" \"So as to do here,\" replied Herbert, \"that which Captain Harding did the very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.\" \"Exactly so,\" answered the reporter, \"and it is the best plan.\" While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing which terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and sea- swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them. Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was inhabited. Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon. They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories, bays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in sight. This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a narrow mouth. \"The domain is limited,\" said Herbert. \"Yes,\" rejoined Pencroft: \"It would have been too small for us.\" \"And moreover,\" said the reporter, \"it appears to be uninhabited.\" \"Indeed,\" answered Herbert, \"nothing here betrays the presence of man.\" \"Let us go down,\" said Pencroft, \"and search.\" The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place where they had left the \"Bonadventure.\" They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their investigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed round. The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance. \"Those beasts yonder,\" observed the reporter, \"do not see men for the first time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.\" An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background bordered with thick woods. There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours\u0027 walking had been gone completely round. It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps, after all the document was already several months or several years old, and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery. Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable conjectures, dined rapidly on board the \"Bonadventure\" so as to be able to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five o\u0027clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood. Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species. Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had rapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take them back to Lincoln Island. It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the hand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find them. \"But,\" observed Gideon Spilett, \"this not only proves that men have landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now, who were these men? How many of them remain?\" \"The document,\" said Herbert, \"only spoke of one castaway.\" \"Well, if he is still on the island,\" replied Pencroft, \"it is impossible but that we shall find him.\" The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally followed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea. If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed incontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the midst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with culinary plants, at probably the same distant period. What, then, was Herbert\u0027s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory, sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island. \"Capital, jolly!\" exclaimed Pencroft. \"That will suit Neb as well as us. Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have been useless, and God will have rewarded us.\" \"Doubtless,\" replied Gideon Spilett, \"but to see the state in which we find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been inhabited for some time.\" \"Indeed,\" answered Herbert, \"an inhabitant, whoever he was, could not have neglected such an important culture!\" \"Yes,\" said Pencroft, \"the castaway has gone.\" \"We must suppose so.\" \"It must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?\" \"Evidently.\" \"And that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated in the sea a long time.\" \"Why not?\" returned Pencroft. \"But night is coming on,\" added he, \"and I think that it will be best to give up the search for the present.\" \"Let us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,\" said the reporter. This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when Herbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,-- \"A hut!\" All three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick tarpaulin. The half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a rapid step. The hut was empty! “一个遇难的人流落在达抱岛上了！”潘克洛夫大声说，“离我们几百英里！啊，史密斯先生，现在你不再反对我去了吧。” “不错，潘克洛夫，”赛勒斯·史密斯说；“你尽快地动身吧。” “明天怎么样？” “就明天吧！” 工程师手里还拿着瓶子里的那张纸。他仔细地察看了一会，然后接着说： “朋友们，从这张纸上，从它的措辞上了我们可以得出这样的结论：首先，达抱岛上的遇难人具有相当丰富的航海知识，因为他所写的达抱岛的经纬度和我们测量出来的完全相同，而且他连分度也大致求出来了；其次，他不是英国人就是美国人，因为他写的是英文。” “完全合乎道理，”史佩莱说，“有了这个遇难人，就可以说明我们在岛上找到的那只箱子是从哪里来的了。既然有遇难的人，就一定有过遇难的船，潘克洛夫想起来要造船，而且偏在今天试航，对于这个遇难的人来说，不管他是谁，总算是他的运气。再晚一天，瓶子也许就会撞在石头上碰得粉碎。” “的确，”赫伯特说，“乘风破浪号正好从它漂着的地方经过，真是太巧了！” “你觉得这件事奇怪吗？”史密斯向潘克洛夫问道。 “我只觉得凑巧，”水手回答说：“你觉得有什么奇怪吗，史密斯先生？瓶子总要漂到一个地方去的，既然能漂到别处去，为什么就不能漂到这儿来呢？” “也许你说得对，潘克洛夫，”工程师答道，“不过……” “可是，”赫伯特说，“还是没法证明瓶子在海里已经漂浮多久了。” “不错，”吉丁·史佩菜说；“这张纸条好象还是最近才写的。你认为怎么样，赛勒斯？” “很难说，我们以后会知道的。”史密斯答道。 谈话的时候，潘克洛夫并没有闲着。他掉转了船的方向，乘风破浪号扯起满帆，飞快地向爪角驶去。 人人都在想达抱岛上的遇难人。他们去救他还来得及吗？在移民们的生活中，这是一件大事！他们自己也是遇难的人，但是恐怕别人遇难就不会有这样幸运了，他们有责任去帮助他。 他们绕过爪角，大约四点钟的时候，乘风破浪号在慈悲河口抛锚了。 当晚他们就积极准备新的远征。看来由潘克洛夫和赫伯特两人前去探险最合适，因为他俩都懂得怎样行船。如果第二天（10月11日）启程，13日他们就可以到达目的地，因为以目前的风势来说，要不了四十八小时就可以航行一百五十海里。在达抱岛上逗留一天，回来需要三四天。因此，预计在10月17日他们就可以回林肯岛了。近来天气晴朗，温度上升，风势好象也很稳定，一切都有利于这两位勇士远离海岛去完成这桩义举。 大家决定，让赛勒斯·史密斯、纳布和吉丁·史佩莱留在“花岗石宫”里，可是史佩莱提出了不同意见，他毕竟没有忘记自己是《纽约先驱报》的通讯记者，他表示即使游泳过去也愿意，决不错过这样的机会，于是他被批准参加远征了。 傍晚的时候，大家忙着把一切需要的东西搬到船上去，其中有铺盖、器皿、武器、弹药、指南针以及够吃一星期的粮食，这些工作很快地做完以后，移民们就回到“花岗石宫”去了。 第二天清晨五点钟，大家互相告别，这时候，彼此都有些依依不舍。潘克洛夫扬起了帆，向爪角出发了，他们必须绕过爪角，向西南前进。 离岸已经四分之一海里了，乘风破浪号上的旅客们还看见在“花岗石宫”的高岗上有两个人在向他们挥手惜别，那就是赛勒斯·史密斯和纳布。 “朋友们，”史佩莱不禁喊道，“十五个月以来，我们还是第一次分别呢。” 潘克洛夫、通讯记者和赫伯特也向他们招手致意，不久以后，“花岗石宫”就消失在爪角的石壁后面了。 这一天上午，乘风破浪号一直在林肯岛以南一带，过了不久，他们再看看海岛，海岛就好象一个绿色的篮子，高耸在海岛中央的是富兰克林山。从远处看来，山岗显得并不突出，它吸引不住过往船只的注意。走了一个钟头的光景，他们已经入海离爬虫角十海里左右了。 现在已经看不清一直伸展到富兰克林山山脊的西海岸；三个钟头以后，整个的林肯岛都消失在水平线下边了。 乘风破浪号航行的情况很好。它穿过波浪，飞快地向前驶去。潘克洛夫张起前帆，按照指南针，掌握着直线方向前进。赫伯特和他轮流掌舵，少年的双手非常牢稳，水手连一点毛病找不出来。 吉丁·史佩莱有时和这个谈谈，有时和那个谈谈，必要的时候，他也帮助料理一下绳索；潘克洛夫船长对他的俩个水手感到十分满意。 傍晚，一钩新月在苍茫的暮色中出现了片刻，不久就落下去了，要等到16日，才能看到上弦月。夜色非常昏暗，然而满天星斗，可以断定明天还是晴天。 潘克洛夫小心地落下前帆，以防在满帆的时候突然遭到夜风的袭击。夜晚这样平静，这样小心也许是多余的，然而潘克洛夫是一个谨慎的水手，这样做并没有错。 通讯记者夜里睡了半宿。潘克洛夫和赫伯特轮流在舵旁休息，两个钟头一换班。水手相信赫伯特简直和相信自己一样，少年的沉着和果断足以证明他的信任是正确的。潘克洛夫象船长指挥舵手似的指示着他，赫伯特一刻也没有使乘风破浪号的前进方位发生偏差。第一夜平安度过了，10月12日白天的情况也是这样。他们严格地保持着向西南方前进，如果乘风破浪号不遇到别的海流，它一定能直接驶入达抱岛的视线范围。 当时在他们一路经过的海面上四望无人，偶尔有只把巨大的信天翁或是军舰鸟飞到枪弹的射程以内来，吉丁·史佩莱不禁想起这是不是他上次用来带信给《纽约先驱报》的那只呢？达抱岛和林肯岛之间的一带洋面，好象只有这种鸟常常往来。 “可是，”赫伯特说，“现在是捕鲸船常到南太平洋来的季节，真的，我想再也找不到比这儿更寂寞的海面了。” “并不象你所说的那么寂寞。”潘克洛夫说。 “我不明白你的意思。”通讯记者说。 “还有我们在海面上呢，难道你们把这只船当做难船，把自己当做小鲸鱼了吗？” 潘克洛夫一面说，一面笑。 傍晚的时候，他们估计乘风破浪号离开林肯岛以来，也就是说在这三十六小时内，已经航行一百二十海里了；它的每小时速度是三海里到四海里。现在风势很小，而且可能马上就要停下来。尽管这样，如果估计得不错，航线也正确，明天破晓的时候，他们还是能够看见达抱岛的。 在10月12到13日的这一夜，吉丁·史佩菜、赫伯特和潘克洛夫都没有睡觉。由于盼望着天明，他们不免有些激动。这次冒险的前途怎样，很难预料！他们是不是已经要到达抱岛了呢？他们要救的那个遇难人还在岛上吗？这个人究竟是什么人？这几个移民一向团结得很好，他们的团结会不会因为多了这个人而遭到破坏呢？此外，那个遇难人愿不愿换一个困守的地方呢？毫无疑问，所有这些问题，明天都可以得到解决，然而现在却使他们安不下心来。天一亮，他们的眼睛就全都注视着西方的水平线。 “陆地！”潘克洛夫喊道，这时是清晨六点钟。 潘克洛夫是不会看错的，陆地肯定是在那里，我们不难想象乘风破浪号上的水手们这时是多么高兴。再过几个钟头，他们就可以登上达抱岛的海滩了！ 达抱岛的海岸很低，只比水面稍微高出一点点，现在离他们不过十五海里了。 乘风破浪号直对着海岛开会，船头稍稍偏向它的南部，太阳从东方升起，阳光照耀着一两处海峡。 “这个小岛比起林肯岛来还要小，”赫伯特说，“大概和我们那个岛一样，也是由海底地震形成的。” 十一点钟的时候，乘风破浪号离海岛不过二海里了；潘克洛夫一面寻找适合登陆的海岸，一面小心翼翼地在陌生的海面上继续前进。现在可以清楚地看到达抱岛了，可以看见岛上丛生着一些橡皮树和其他的大树，它们的品种都和林肯岛上的一样，令人感到诧异的是，岛上并没有一缕显示人迹的炊烟，整个的海岸上，丝毫也没有有人的迹象： 然而纸条上写得很清楚，这里有一个遇难的人，而且他一定在等待着。 这时候，乘风破浪号穿过礁石，驶进了曲曲折折的海峡，潘克洛夫十分小心地注意着每一个弯曲部分。他让赫伯特掌着舵，自己站在船头，察看海水，手里握着帆索，随时准备下帆。吉丁·史佩莱拿着望远镜，焦急地向海岸了望，然而什么也没有发现。 十二点钟的时候，乘风破浪号的船身终于碰到陆地了。水手们抛下船锚，把帆收起来，然后登岸。 毫无疑问，这就是达抱岛，因为根据最新的航海地图，在新西兰和美洲之间的这一带太平洋上，再也没有其他的岛屿了。 他们把船牢牢地系好，以防退潮的时候海水把它冲走，然后潘克洛夫和他的伙伴们全副武装，踏上了海岸，打算爬到半英里以外一座二百五十至三百英尺高的小山上去。 “站在那座小山的顶上，”史佩莱说，“我们先看清岛的全貌，然后再搜查就方便得多了。” “史密斯先生在林肯岛上的第一件事，就是爬上富兰克林山，”赫伯特说，“我们在这里也这么做。” “一点也不错，”通讯记者说，“这是最好的行动方针。” 探险家们一面说，一面在一块空地上往前走，这块空地一直伸晨到小山脚下。成群的野鸽和海鸥在他们周围振翼飞翔，看来都和林肯岛上的差不多。空地的左边也是一片丛林，他们听见灌木丛里有沙沙的响声，野草也在摆动，说明里面藏着什么胆小的动物；然而还是看不出岛上有人。 到了山脚下以后，潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特只费了几分钟，就爬到山上去了，他们急切地环视着水平线。 他们所在的这个小岛，周围不过六英里，海角、地岬、港湾和河流都很少，样子是个拉长的椭圆形。四面一直到天边都是单调的大海，看不见一片陆地，也看不见一叶孤帆。 这个树木丛生的小岛和林肯岛不同，林肯岛有的地方荒芜贫瘠，有的地方丰饶富庶，变化很多。相反地，这里到处都是绿荫，其中也有两三座小山，然而都不高。一条河流斜躺在椭圆形的海岛上，通过一大片草地，向西流入大海、入海的地方河口很窄。 “这个海岛的面积很小。”赫伯特说。 “是的，”潘克洛夫接着说。“对我们说来，嫌太小了些。” “并且，”通讯记者说，“岛上好象并没有人。” “的确，”赫伯特答道，“丝毫也看不出有人居住的迹象。” “下山去，”潘克洛夫说，“搜查搜查。” 水手和他的两个伙伴下了山，回到停泊乘风破浪号的地方。 在深入内陆以前，他们决定徒步环绕海岛巡视一周，这样在搜查的时候，就不会遗漏任何地方了。沿着海滩走起来并不困难，只有几处有大岩石拦住道路，可是他们毫不费力就绕过去了。探险家们向南进发，他们惊起了大群的海鸟和海豹，海豹一看见远处有人来，立刻就跳下水去。 “这里的海豹，”通讯记者说，“已经不是第一次看见人了，它们怕人，说明它们对人是了解的。” 他们走了一个钟头，到了小岛的南端，这里的尽头是一个突出的海角；然后沿着西岸往北前进，这一带也是沙石海岸，背后衬托着一片茂密的丛林。 步行了四个钟头，把整个的海岛都搜遍了，然而无论哪里都没有住人的迹象，海滩上也找不到一个人的脚印。 他们不得不认为达抱岛上没有人，或是现在已经没有人，这一点是非常奇怪的。也许那张纸条是几个月甚至几年以前写的，因此遇难的人不是已经返回祖国，就是悲惨地死去了。 潘克洛夫、史佩莱和赫伯特一面猜测——这些猜测多少是有些可能的——一面在乘风破浪号上赶快吃饭，以便在天黑以前继续搜索。吃完饭，已经是傍晚五点钟，他们立刻进入了森林。 许多动物一看见他们都四散逃跑，其中主要的是山羊和猪，一看就知道它们是欧洲种。 毫无疑问，曾经有捕鲸船到过这里，这些猪羊就是船上留下，然后在岛上繁殖起来的。赫伯特决定要活捉一两只带回林肯岛去。 现在已经可以肯定这个小岛曾经有人来过。更充分的证据是：森林里的道路好象被践踏过，树木有很多被用斧砍倒，到处都有人类双手劳动的遗迹；然而树木都是多年以前砍倒的，已经腐朽了，木头上被斧头砍过的地方长满了绒状的青苔，而且道路上丛生着很深的荒草，很难找到树桩。 “可是，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“这不但能证明有人到岛上来过，而且还能证明他们在岛上住过一个时期。这些人究竟是谁，他们还有多少人留在这里呢？” “根据纸条上所说的，”赫伯特说，“只有一个遇难的人。” “好吧，如果他还在岛上，”潘克洛夫说，“我们是不会找不到他的。” 她们继续往前搜查。水手和他的伙伴们自然而然地沿着通往大海的河流，斜穿海岛，往前走去。 如果欧洲种的动物和双手劳动的遗迹可以作为有人到岛上来过的铁证，那么这里的某种植物也同样能说明这一点。有些地方，在林间的空地上，显然曾经种过食用的蔬菜，论时间大概也是在很久以前。 特别使赫伯特高兴的是，他发现了许多马铃薯、菊苣、酸模、胡萝卜、白菜和芜菁，只要搜集一些它们的种籽，就可以拿到林肯岛的土地上去播种了。 “好极了，哈哈！”潘克洛夫喊道。“这些东西对纳布合适，对我们也合适。就算我们找不到遇难的人，这次航行也不算白来，真是天保佑我们。” “不错，”吉丁·史佩莱说：“不过根据我们所发现的这片开垦地的情况看来，恐怕岛上已经很久没有人住了。” “的确，”赫伯特说，“不管是什么样的居民，他决不会不照料这么重要的农作物的！” “是的，”潘克洛夫说，“遇难人已经走了……我们只好这样假定……” “只好认为纸条是很久以前写的了，是吗？” “当然。” “照这么说，瓶子是在海里漂了很久，才到林肯岛附近的。” “那有什么不可能呢？”潘克洛夫说，“天晚了，”他接着说，“我认为现在最好停止搜查。” “我们回船去吧，明天再重新开始，”通讯记者说。 这是最好的办法，他们正打算回去，突然赫伯特指着树木间的一团黑影叫道： “一所房子！” 三个人立刻一起向房子跑去。在苍茫的暮色中，勉强能看出这是个用木板钉成的房子，上面盖着一层厚厚的防雨布。潘克洛夫一个箭步冲过去，推开了半掩的门。房子是空的！","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2902.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious
