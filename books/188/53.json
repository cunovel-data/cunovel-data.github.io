{"id":5863,"no":53,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 11","content":"Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to his lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent antifebrile.\n This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came there might be discussed later.\n \"Some coffee!\" said Spilett.\n In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in making Herbert drink the mixture.\n There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had not yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would not return!\n Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment, when they had despaired of it.\n In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than ever. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into Granite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of the genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius himself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours.\n The next day some improvement in Herbert\u0027s condition was apparent. Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were animated by returning hope.\n This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December, Herbert\u0027s convalescence commenced.\n He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no access of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such docility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!\n Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss. Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace. Since then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.\n The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.\n \"We will find him!\" repeated the sailor.\n Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!\n The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which the colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried. They commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and a tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert\u0027s recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of Granite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which could not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!\n \"It is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!\" said Pencroft.\n During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer and Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions did not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered, the expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be undertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all the strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain satisfaction from the convicts.\n However, Herbert\u0027s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely healed.\n During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau of Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The grain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for the approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard, wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his companions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very probably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. when the island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding. The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength visibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen years of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and commanding presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring care,--and Dr. Spilett was very strict,--made rapid progress. Towards the end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect Heights, and the beach.\n He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with Pencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought he might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of February was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would be favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the island.\n The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and were important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite House until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to exterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on the other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the fortunes of the colony.\n Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast from Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.\n They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the left bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which supported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the north, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed. Consequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations.\n It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of the Mercy.\n It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral, where it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge, either to pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the devastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by this time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the convicts\u0027 interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be still time to go and turn them out on their return.\n Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place Granite House in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.\n The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a long journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it was necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about the woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might quickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever.\n It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top and Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible dwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure, was consecrated entirely to repose, and--thanksgiving addressed by the colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert, who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were formerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the colonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and nothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite House in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down, left no communication between the upper landing and the beach.\n The weather was magnificent.\n \"We shall have a warm day of it,\" said the reporter, laughing.\n \"Pooh! Dr. Spilett,\" answered Pencroft, \"we shall walk under the shade of the trees and shan\u0027t even see the sun!\"\n \"Forward!\" said the engineer.\n The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter made Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor\u0027s orders.\n Neb placed himself at the onagers\u0027 heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert offered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony. The moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.\n The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers, leaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods which formed the region of the Far West.\n For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the colonists.\n The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground. Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees, and other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could reach. The feathered tribes of the island were all represented--grouse, jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos, parrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly at their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first excursions they had made on their arrival at the island.\n \"Nevertheless,\" observed Cyrus Harding, \"I notice that these creatures, both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods have, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly find some traces of them.\"\n And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or less recent, of the passage of a band of men--here branches broken off the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a settled encampment.\n The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who were, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would necessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous to leave unguarded.\n In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House, their progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before entering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the evening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it evidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the soil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal, for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that the night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense; but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames, and it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness of night.\n The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were to watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett in one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns over the camp.\n The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun. The silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate Master Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the 15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than difficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than six miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their hatchets.\n Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the small ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a very winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.\n During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out like the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of which the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp of excellent flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of magnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet. These were the tree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.\n As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to the hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong to the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was their speed.\n As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some footprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were attentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the other, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men\u0027s feet were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently camped on this spot; but,--and this was the object of so minute an examination,--a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that case would have been that of Ayrton.\n \"Ayrton was not with them!\" said Herbert.\n \"No,\" answered Pencroft, \"and if he was not with them, it was because the wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a den to which they may be tracked like tigers!\"\n \"No,\" replied the reporter, \"it is more probable that they wander at random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they will be masters of the island!\"\n \"The masters of the island!\" exclaimed the sailor; \"the masters of the island!...\" he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, \"Do you know, Captain Harding,\" said he, \"what the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?\"\n \"No, Pencroft!\"\n \"It is the ball that went through Herbert\u0027s chest, and I promise you it won\u0027t miss its mark!\"\n But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas! conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.\n That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus Harding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from Reptile Point.\n And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor that, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.\n 吉丁·史佩莱拿起匣子，把它打开。匣子里盛着约有二百克莱因的白色粉末。他尝了一点。味道很苦；于是一切怀疑都打消了，毫无疑问，这就是提炼过的宝贵的奎宁，最有效的退热剂。\n 必须毫不耽搁地让赫伯特把这种药粉吃下去。至于它是怎么来的，不妨以后再讨论。\n “准备一些咖啡！”史佩莱说。\n 不一会儿，纳布端来一杯温热的咖啡。吉丁·史佩莱在里面加了大约十八克莱因的奎宁。他们顺利地给赫伯特喂完了这种混合液体。\n 时间还赶得上，恶性疟疾第三次还没有发作。他们多么盼望它从此就不再发作了啊：\n 必须附带说明，现在人人都又充满希望了。在这紧要关头，当大家都已经绝望了的时候，神秘的力量又发挥了它的作用。\n 几个钟头以后，赫伯特平静得多了。现在居民们可以讨论一下这件事情。陌生人的支援变得比以前任何一次都明显。可是，他怎么能在夜里深入“花岗石宫”的呢？这是不可思议的。岛上这位圣人的行动简直和他本人一样神秘。这一天，他们每隔三个钟头就让赫伯特吃一次硫酸奎宁。\n 第二天，赫伯特的病情显著好转了。当然，他还没有脱离危险，疟疾这种病往往会复发，只要复发起来就是危险的，可是大家对他照顾得无微不至。此外，现在手头还有特效药，送药的人无疑又不在远处！于是大家的希望又重新浮现出来了。\n 他们这次并没有失望。十天以后，从12月20日起，赫伯特开始复原了。\n 他的身体还很虚弱，只是不再转入发烧的状况了。大家对他的饮食给予严格的限制。可怜的孩子多么自觉听话，遵守一切的规定！他多么希望早日痊愈啊！\n 潘克洛夫就象一个刚刚被从深渊里挽救出来的人似的，他高兴得简直要发狂了。在预计该有第三次发作的时间过去以后，他紧紧的抱住通讯记者，几乎使他连气也透不过来。从此以后，他就把通讯记者叫做史佩莱医生了。\n 然而，真正的医生还是没有发现。\n “我们一定要找到他！”水手一再地说。\n 不管这个人是谁，肯定地说，一旦被好心的潘克洛夫找到以后，准会得到十二万分热烈的拥抱的！\n 1867年随着十二月份过去了，在这一年的年底，移民们遭到了严重的考验。1868年开始的时候，天气晴朗，气候仿佛是热带那么炎热，幸而有海风吹来，才令人感到凉爽些。赫伯特的健康正在恢复。他的床就在“花岗石宫”的一个窗口，他可以呼吸到含有臭氧的新鲜空气，这对恢复他的健康，是有极大作用的。他的胃口也恢复了，纳布给他准备了多少鲜美可口的菜肴啊！\n “给预备这么多好吃的东西，谁都想得疟疾了！”潘克洛夫说。\n 在这期间，罪犯们始终没有在“花岗石宫”附近出现。艾尔通也没有下落，虽然工程师和赫伯特还希望能够重新找到他，他们的伙伴却都认为这个不幸的人已经死了。无论如何，这个疑问是不会存在太久的，只要少年复原以后，就可以远征了。远征的结果将会有非常重大意义的。为了向罪犯们讨还血债，就必须出动小队的全部力量，因此，他们也许还要等一个月。\n 可是，赫伯特的健康恢复得很快，肝脏已经不再充血，创伤也基本上收口了。\n 在一月份中，眺望岗的高地上进行了重要的工作：工作的内容只有一样，就是把劫后的庄稼，不管是小麦还是菜蔬，尽量贮藏起来。他们捡了许多麦粒和植物，准备在未来的半个季度中重新播种。关于家禽场的外壁和厩房的修复工作，赛勒斯·史密斯打算过一个时期再做。因为当他和他的伙伴们出发追踪的时候，罪犯们很可能再度光临高地；给他们创造一个第二次破坏的机会，那实在太不必要了。他们可以等到把岛上的匪徒肃清以后，再着手修复。在一月份的第二个星期里，少年开始下床了；最初他每天起来一个钟头，然后是两个钟头，三个钟头。由于他的体质健壮，体力恢复起来也很快。他今年十八岁，身材很高，一看就知道将来会长成一个相貌堂堂的男子汉。从这时候起，他的健康——史佩莱严格地指出还需要休养——迅速地恢复起来。月底的时候，赫伯特已经能在眺望岗和海滩上散步了。\n 他和潘克洛夫、纳布一块洗过几次海水浴，结果好处很大。赛勒斯·史密斯觉得现在时机已经成熟，就决定在2月15日动身。在一年的这个季节，夜晚非常清朗，这对搜索整个的海岛是有利的。\n 于是开始进行准备远征的必要工作了。这项工作非常重要，因为移民们已经下定决心，不达到他们的双重目标，决不回“花岗石宫”。他们一方面要歼灭罪犯——如果艾尔通没有死，还要把他救出来；另一方面，还要找出这个真正掌握着小队命运的，究竟是什么人。\n 在林肯岛上，居民们彻底了解的地方有：从爪角到颚骨角之间整个的东海岸，宽阔的潦凫沼地，格兰特湖的周围，畜栏路和慈悲河之间的啄木鸟林，慈悲河流域和红河流域，最后，还有富兰克林山的支脉——建立畜栏的那个地方。\n 还有一些地方，虽然知道得不太彻底，但也探索过了，那就是：从爪角到爬虫角之间华盛顿湾的宽阔海岸，西边的沼泽森林海岸，和一直绵延到鲨鱼湾港口的看不到边的沙丘。除了上面所说的地方以外，覆盖盘蛇半岛的森林，慈悲河右边的整个地区，瀑布河的左岸，以及支撑富兰克林山麓东、西、北三面支脉与山谷的荒野，他们都没有探索过；毫无疑问，这里会有许多隐蔽的地方。照这样估计，岛上还有上千英亩的地方没有考察过。\n 因此，他们决定深入远西地带去探险，并且搜索慈悲河右边的整个地区。\n 也许最好还是直接到畜栏去，因为罪犯们为了抢劫，或是为了安身，可能又躲到那里去了。可是现在有两种情形：一种是罪犯已经把畜栏破坏了，要想去阻止也来不及；另一种就是罪犯们还坚守在里面。如果是第二种情形的话，等到回来的时候再赶他们也不迟。\n 经过讨论以后，他们决定采用第一个计划：穿过森林，到爬虫角去。他们要用斧头开路，草草地开辟出一条十六到十七英里长的道路轮廓，从“花岗石宫”一直通到半岛的末端。\n 大车完好无损。野驴休息了很长时间，可以参加远征。食品、露营用具、轻便火炉和各种器皿都包好装在大车上。“花岗石宫”的兵器库在目前来说相当完善了，他们从里面仔细挑选了一些火药和武器。有一点必须记住，罪犯们也许就在森林里游荡；如果走在密林深处，很可能被冷枪打中。因此，居民们决定要集体行动，不管什么理由，都不准离开。\n 大家还决定，“花岗石宫”里一个人也不留。连托普和杰普都随同参加远征。这所外人上不去的住宅是不需要留守的。2月14日是动身的前夕，这一天是星期日。移民们休息了一整天，并且做了祈祷。他们看到少年虽然已经完全恢复了健康，但身体总还是弱一些，就在大车里安排了一个位子给他坐。赛勒斯·史密斯为了防止“花岗石宫”受到侵略，就在第二天破晓以后作了一些必要的安排。过去用来攀登的梯子，拿到“石窟”去了。他们把它深深地埋在沙地里，准备回来的时候用，因为升降梯的机械都一块一块地卸开了，全套装置拆得一点也不剩。最后只剩潘克洛夫一个人留在“花岗石宫”里进行这项工作。拆完以后，他用一根分成两股的绳子，下面由人拉着，从上面系下来。只要绳子一扯下来，上面的平台和海滩之间就断绝交通了。\n 这一天天气很好。\n “今天够暖和的。”通讯记者笑道。\n “嘿！史佩莱医生，”潘克洛夫说，“我们可以在树荫下走，保险连太阳都看不见！”\n “走吧！”工程师说。\n 大车在“石窟”前的海滩上等着。通讯记者让赫伯特上了车，要他至少在头几个钟头的旅途中坐车行进。少年只好听医生的话。\n 出发的时候已到，小队动身了。纳布牵着野驴前进。赛勒斯·史密斯、通讯记者和水手在车前面走。托普一路高兴地蹦蹦跳跳。赫伯特在车里找了一个位子给杰普，杰普毫不客气地坐了下来。\n 大车首先绕过慈悲河的拐角，翻过左岸向前走了一英里，然后过桥；桥这边就是通往气球港的大路。探险家们从路口往右拐去，进入了遍布森林的远西地带。\n 最初两英里之内，树木稀疏，大车可以顺利通行；只是常常需要斩断一些爬藤和灌木，在这一段路途中，移民们还没有遇到严重的障碍。\n 浓密的枝叶阴影投在地面上，构成一片恰合人意的树荫。喜马拉雅杉、洋松、“加苏林那”树、山茂、橡皮树、龙血树，和其他许多有名的品种，一棵接着一棵，一眼望不到头。岛上的各种鸟类这里应有尽有：山鸡、啄木鸟、雉、猩猩、鹦鹉，以及叽叽喳喳乱叫的美冠鹦鹉、鹦鹉和长尾鹦鹉。刺鼠、袋鼠和水豚看见人们走近，就飞也似的逃跑了，这一切都勾起居民们的回忆，他们想起了来到岛上以后第一次打猎时的情景。\n “可是，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我发现这些飞禽走兽都比过去胆小了。从这点看来，罪犯们最近曾经从这部分森林里走过，我们一定可以找到他们的踪迹的。”\n 果然，他们找到几处象有一小队人在最近通过的足迹，有的地方大概是为了沿路做记号，把树枝折断了；有的地方留下一堆灰烬，粘土地上还有一些脚印；可是找不到任何露宿的迹象。\n 工程师已经指示大家不要打猎了。也许罪犯们就在森林里，一开枪就要惊动他们。而且要打猎就必须离开大车，走出一段距离。留下大车没人看管是非常危险的。\n 下半天，离开“花岗石宫”六英里的光景，前进困难得多了。为了穿过密林，他们不得不砍去一些树木。在走进这种地方以前，史密斯总是很仔细地先让托普和杰普进去，它们忠实地执行任务，如果它们不作任何警告地回来，就可以断定这里没有任何危险，既没有罪犯，又没有野兽。这二者同样属于动物界，凶残的本性是半斤八两的。第一天晚上，移民们在离“花岗石宫”九英里左右的地方露宿，近旁有一条小溪流入慈悲河，他们从来不知道有这条小溪，而它的水路系统使土壤变得十分肥沃，这是可以肯定的。居民们肚子饿了，就饱餐了一顿，然后安排怎样平安过夜。如果工程师只需要对付野兽，例如美洲豹或其他兽类，那只要在帐篷周围点起火来，就足够防御它们了；可是有了罪犯，他们不但不会被营火惊走，相反地，恐怕还会被招引过来。考虑结果，最好还是让自己包围在漆黑的夜色里。\n 他们小心地组织了守夜的工作。大家一致同意两个人一班担任警戒，每隔两个钟头换班一次。尽管赫伯特一再提出，居民们还是不让他守夜。于是，潘克洛夫和吉丁·史佩莱一班，工程师和纳布一班，就这样在营地周围站岗放哨了。\n 夜晚仅仅是几个钟头，与其说是由于没有太阳而造成的，还不如说是由于枝叶过分浓密而造成的黑暗。森林里非常寂静，只是有时传来几声美洲豹的怒吼和猿猴的叫声。小杰普似乎特别不爱听猴子叫。这一夜平安无事地度过了。第二天2月16日，继续在森林中穿行，旅途中虽然有困难，但更令人烦恼的却是一路上枯燥无味的感觉。这一天他们走了不到六英里，因为时间大都浪费在用斧头开路上面了。\n 移民们就象定居在这里的人一样，仅仅砍倒一些小树，把那些高大而美丽的树木保留下来；当然，不砍大树也是因为需要花许多劳动力才能砍倒的缘故。可是这么一来，道路就格外弯曲。由于转弯抹角的地方很多，大大地延长了他们的路程。\n 这一天，赫伯特发现了几种以前在岛上没有遇到过的新植物品种，例如叶子象泉水似的四面披开的桫椤和刺槐。刺槐上除了结有野驴特别爱吃的长荚以外，还有一种香甜可口的果肉。在这里，移民们又发现了几丛雄伟的卡利松。它们的树干是圆柱形的，顶上有一簇锥形的绿叶，树身高达二百英尺。卡利松是新西兰的万树之王，和黎巴嫩的杉树一样远近闻名。\n 至于动物方面，除了猎人们已经见过的以外，没有其他的品种了。然而，虽然没法接近，他们却看见一对澳洲所特有的大飞禽。这是一种名叫鸸鹋的食火鸡，身高五尺，长有褐色的羽毛，属于涉水鸟类。托普撒开四条腿，拚命向它们赶去，可是鸸鹋奔走的速度很快，一眨眼就把它抛在后面了。\n 至于罪犯们留下的遗迹，他们另外还发现一些。有一堆余烬显然是最近才熄灭的，在它附近有一些脚印。居民们仔细地检查了一下。他们一一测量了脚印的长度和宽度，很容易看出来这是五个人的脚印。这五个罪犯一定曾在这里露宿过。如果有第六个人的脚印，那一定是艾尔通的，可是，他们经过仔细研究，并没有发现第六个人的脚印。\n “艾尔通没有和他们在一起！”赫伯特说。\n “不错，”潘克洛夫说，“既然不在一起，那一定是已经被匪徒们杀死了！这些流氓连个窝也没有，要不然我们可以象追老虎似的追逐他们！”\n “不错，”通讯记者说，“他们大概一直在各处漫无目的地漂荡，打算直到成为岛上的主人为止！”\n “岛上的主人！”水手大声叫道；“岛上的主人！……”他重复着，好象有一只铁爪扼住了他的喉咙似的，他连话也说不出来了。然后他说：“史密斯先生，”这时他的声音平静一些了，“你知道我的枪里装的是一颗什么子弹吗？”\n “不知道，潘克洛夫！”\n “就是打透赫伯特胸膛的那颗子弹，我向你保证，一定要用它打中目标！”\n 可是不管这个报复多么公平合理，也已经不能使艾尔通复活了。察看了遗留在地上的脚印以后，他们只能得出这样的结论：再也不能希望和他重新见面了。\n 当天晚，上，他们在离“花岗石宫”十四英里的地方露宿。赛勒斯·史密斯估计他们离爬虫角已经不到五英里了。\n 果然，第二天他们到达了半岛的尽头。森林的纵长方向全走完了，可是他们并没有找到罪犯们藏身的地方，也同样没有找到神秘的陌生人的秘密住处。\n \n
