{"id":5844,"no":34,"title":"Book 2 Chapter 12","content":"In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of snipe round his body.\n \"Here, master,\" cried Neb; \"here\u0027s something to employ our time! Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must have some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.\"\n \"No, Neb,\" replied the sailor; \"I have the rigging of the vessel to finish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.\"\n \"And you, Mr. Herbert?\"\n \"I must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,\" replied the lad.\n \"It will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?\"\n \"To oblige you, Neb, I will,\" replied the reporter; \"but I warn you that if you disclose your receipts to me, I shall publish them.\"\n \"Whenever you like, Mr. Spilett,\" replied Neb; \"whenever you like.\"\n And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb\u0027s assistant and was installed in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made known to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day before, and on this point the reporter shared Harding\u0027s opinion, that although he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!\n The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling was filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned manipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.\n During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the sailmaker\u0027s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the sails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks to the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon, the ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the sailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached strong bolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the halyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under Pencroft\u0027s directions by means of the turning lathe. It therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their glorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the thirty-seven stars, representing the thirty- seven States of the Union, which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the star of \"the State of Lincoln,\" for he considered his island as already united to the great republic. \"And,\" said he, \"it is so already in heart, if not in deed!\"\n In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.\n The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced with complete destruction.\n After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four o\u0027clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top\u0027s barking.\n The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at the threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to burst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.\n \"Hello, Top!\" cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued to bark more furiously than ever.\n \"What\u0027s the matter now?\" asked Harding.\n And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.\n Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular yelping noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had been invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen.\n \"What are they?\" cried Pencroft.\n \"Wolves, jaguars, or apes?\" replied Neb.\n \"They have nearly reached the plateau,\" said the reporter.\n \"And our poultry-yard,\" exclaimed Herbert, \"and our garden!\"\n \"Where can they have crossed?\" asked Pencroft.\n \"They must have crossed the bridge on the shore,\" replied the engineer, \"which one of us must have forgotten to close.\"\n \"True,\" said Spilett, \"I remember having left it open.\"\n \"A fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,\" cried the sailor.\n \"What is done cannot be undone,\" replied Cyrus Harding. \"We must consult what it will now be best to do.\"\n Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and fought with if necessary.\n \"But what are these beasts?\" was asked a second time, as the yelpings were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert start, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit to the sources of the Red Creek.\n \"They are colpeo foxes!\" he exclaimed.\n \"Forward!\" shouted the sailor.\n And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.\n Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves into the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants draw back.\n The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite.\n This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding\u0027s orders, they reached the spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a club.\n The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the revolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot coals.\n \"They must not pass!\" shouted Pencroft.\n \"They shall not pass!\" returned the engineer.\n But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it. Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already lay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish, and it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually arriving over the bridge.\n The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had, with a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had sprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded his weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep him in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time--a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of great rejoicing.\n At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was coping with great coolness.\n However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side of the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of their assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on the shore.\n \"And Jup!\" cried Pencroft; \"where is Jup?\" Jup had disappeared. His friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his friend\u0027s call.\n Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found among the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal.\n Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest was covered with severe wounds.\n \"He is living,\" cried Neb, who was bending over him.\n \"And we will save him,\" replied the sailor. \"We will nurse him as if he was one of ourselves.\"\n It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft\u0027s shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance. it was therefore only the orang whose condition was serious.\n Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a slight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to Granite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not appear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been dressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, \"just like a real person,\" as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of a cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the vegetable medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless, but his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left sleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one might say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him. One of Jup\u0027s hands hung over the side of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.\n They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the forest of the Far West, and there buried deep.\n This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a lesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one of their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that no invasion was possible.\n However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several days, began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor, pronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being somewhat of a gourmend, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of this fault.\n \"What would you have?\" said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes expostulated with him for spoiling the ape. \"Poor Jup has no other pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this way!\"\n Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup arose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not be long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all convalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any excess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil\u0027s appetite returning.\n \"Eat away, my Jup,\" said he, \"and don\u0027t spare anything; you have shed your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong again!\"\n On the 25th of August Neb\u0027s voice was heard calling to his companions.\n \"Captain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!\"\n The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb\u0027s call, who was then in Jup\u0027s room.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked the reporter.\n \"Look,\" replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see? Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk at the entrance to Granite House!\n \"My pipe,\" cried Pencroft. \"He has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup, I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!\"\n And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar.\n But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor\u0027s ex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy sailor.\n \"Perhaps he is really a man,\" said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. \"Should you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?\"\n \"My word, no,\" replied Neb. \"What astonishes me is that he hasn\u0027t spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!\"\n \"It would amuse me all the same,\" resumed the sailor, \"if some fine day he said to me, \"Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.\"\n \"Yes,\" replied Neb, \"what a pity he was born dumb!\"\n With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again eagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was already completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold.\n As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.\n Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them, approved the sailor\u0027s idea of making the craft as strong as possible. The interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the 15th of September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed, which was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered with boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines in the forest.\n The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first been ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime, twelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.\n A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into two cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers. The foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.\n Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He chose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to square at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast, the rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the Chimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all furnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial trip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.\n During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected. The corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far West forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were discovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite House.\n They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.\n On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant with joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely rigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water\u0027s edge, was floated by the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of Pencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance was to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having built her, he was to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon him with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the \"Bonadventure.\" As soon as the \"Bonadventure\" had been lifted by the rising tide, it was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated. However, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion off the coast. The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest.\n \"All hands on board,\" shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first necessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the event of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.\n Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which had originated with him, although on the sailor\u0027s advice he had altered some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft\u0027s confidence in her, and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island, Harding hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance in letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a boat, which was not of more than fifteen tons\u0027 burden.\n At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the Mercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the masthead, and the \"Bonadventure,\" steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.\n The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels, according to Pencroft\u0027s mode of speaking. After having doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were enchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be of great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the voyage promised to be charming.\n Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow.\n \"How beautiful it is!\" cried Herbert.\n \"Yes, our island is beautiful and good,\" replied Pencroft. \"I love it as I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?\"\n \"Nothing,\" replied Neb; \"nothing, captain.\"\n And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their island!\n During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched the panorama which was developed before his eyes.\n Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.\n \"Well, Captain Harding,\" asked Pencroft, \"what do you think of our vessel?\"\n \"She appears to behave well,\" replied the engineer.\n \"Good! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?\"\n \"What voyage, Pencroft?\"\n \"One to Tabor Island, for instance.\"\n \"My friend,\" replied Harding, \"I think that in any pressing emergency we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the \u0027Bonadventure\u0027 even for a longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island with great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.\"\n \"One likes to know one\u0027s neighbors,\" returned the sailor, who was obstinate in his idea. \"Tabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one! Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.\"\n \"By Jove,\" said Spilett, \"our friend Pencroft has become very particular about the proprieties all at once!\"\n \"I am not particular about anything at all,\" retorted the sailor, who was rather vexed by the engineer\u0027s opposition, but who did not wish to cause him anxiety.\n \"Consider, Pencroft,\" resumed Harding, \"you cannot go alone to Tabor Island.\"\n \"One companion will be enough for me.\"\n \"Even so,\" replied the engineer, \"you will risk depriving the colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five.\"\n \"Out of six,\" answered Pencroft; \"you forget Jup.\"\n \"Out of seven,\" added Neb; \"Top is quite worth another.\"\n \"There is no risk at all in it, captain,\" replied Pencroft.\n \"That is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves uselessly.\"\n The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite determined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident would come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was at first only a doubtful whim.\n After standing off the shore the \"Bonadventure\" again approached it in the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the channels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down since this little creek was to be the harbor.\n They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary to tack to beat against the wind. The \"Bonadventure\" was then going at a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land, scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then by passing gusts.\n Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,--\n \"Luff, Pencroft, luff!\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter,\" replied the sailor; \"a rock?\"\n \"No--wait,\" said Herbert; \"I don\u0027t quite see. Luff again--right--now.\"\n So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the water, and pulled it out, exclaiming,--\n \"A bottle!\"\n He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few cables\u0027 length from the shore.\n Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew the cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these words:--\n \"Castaway . . . . Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11\u0027 S. lat.\"\n 傍晚的时候，打猎的人们兴高采烈地满载而归了。的确，他们四个人所拿的东西，多到不能再多了。一串小水鸭象项圈似的挂在托普的脖子上，杰普身上绕满了成串的鹬鸟。\n “主人，”纳布喊道，“现在我们有事情来消磨时间了！把这些东西做成肉饼存起来，我们就不愁没有余粮啦！可是得有人做我的帮手。我想找你，潘克洛夫。”\n “不成，纳布，”水手答道；“我还要继续做船上的索具呢，我不能帮你。”\n “你呢，赫伯特先生？”\n “明天我要到畜栏去，纳布。”少年答道。\n “那只有你了，史佩莱先生，你愿意帮助我吗？”\n “我愿意帮助你，纳布，”通讯记者答道；“可是我要警告你，假如你的烹任秘诀被我知道，我就要公开发表了。”\n “欢迎，什么时候发表都成，”纳布答道，“什么时候发表都成。”\n 第二天，吉丁·史佩莱就成了纳布的助手，在他的厨房里实习。工程师已经把头一天自己探索的经过告诉史佩莱了，在这一点上通讯记者同意史密斯的看法，虽然没有找到什么，然而秘密还是应该继续探索的！\n 又下了一个星期的霜，居民们除了去照料家禽场以外，始终没有离“花岗石宫”。住所里充满了引人垂涎的香味，这是在纳布和通讯记者大显身手的时候发出来的；可是他们并没有把猎获的全部野味都做成储藏食品；野味在严寒中可以保存得十分完好，因此就把野鸭和其他野禽不加腌制，留着鲜吃，他们认为世界上再也没有比这更鲜美的水鸟了。\n 在这一个星期中，潘克洛夫在缝帆能手赫伯特的大力帮助下。船帆居然完工了。索具也不缺乏。由于找回了气囊和绳网，他们从网子上得到上好的绳索，水手把它们全都利用了。除了在船帆上附加了结实的棉绳外，还余下很多绳子，都作了升降索、护桅索、帆脚索等等。至于船上用的滑车，赛勒斯·史密斯按照潘克洛夫的主意用车床做了一些。因此在船造好以前，整套的索具就都已完工了。潘克洛夫还做了一面美国国旗，国旗上的蓝、红、白三种颜色是从某些染料植物中得来的，这种植物荒岛上极多。不过，在美国国旗上代表合众国三十七州的光辉灿烂的三十六颗星以外、水手又加上了第三十八颗，代表“林肯州”，因为他认为他的岛已经归入伟大合众国的版图了。他说，“就算事实上还没有归并，心里已经归并了！”\n 这期间，他们把国旗升在“花岗石宫”中央的窗户上，居民们向它欢呼了三声，表示敬意。\n 这时候，寒冷的季节即将告终，他们的第二个冬天似乎可以平安地度过了，但是在8月11日的夜间，眺望岗的高地几乎遭到了完全的破坏。\n 忙了一天以后，居民们都睡得很熟，在第二天清晨四点钟的时候，托普的叫声突然把他们惊醒了。\n 这一次狗不是在井边叫，而是在门口叫，它用前爪挠门，好象想把门打开似的。杰普也尖声地叫喊着。\n “喂，托普！”纳布喊道，他是第一个惊醒的。可是狗叫得更凶了。\n “这是怎么回事？”史密斯问道。\n 大家都急忙穿上衣服，冲到窗口，把窗子打开。\n 下面是一片冰雪，朦胧中只见一片灰色。他们什么也看不见，可是他们只听到在远处的黑暗中传来一种奇怪的叫声。显然有一群还没有看到的动物侵袭到海边来了。\n “那是些什么？”潘克洛夫喊道。\n “也许是狼，也许是美洲豹，也许是猴子。”纳布答道。\n “糟糕！它们快到高地了！”通讯记者说。\n “我们的家禽场，”赫伯特大声叫道，“还有我们的菜园！”\n “它们从哪儿过来的呢？”潘克洛夫问道。\n “一定是谁忘了把桥扯起来，”工程师答道，“它们从桥上过来的。”\n “不错，”史佩莱说，“我忘记把桥扯起来了。”\n “你干的好事，史佩莱先生！”水手喊道。\n “已经过去的事没法挽回了，”赛勒斯·史密斯说。“我们最好商量商量现在该怎么办。”\n 赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们匆忙地互相说着话。野兽肯定已跨过桥，侵袭岸边了。不论它们是些什么东西，都能够登上慈悲河的左岸，到眺望岗上来。因此必须赶快迎上去阻止它们，必要的时候，还要和它们拼一场。\n “可是这究竟是些什么野兽呢？”当他们听见野兽叫得更响的时候，这个问题又提出来了。赫伯特听了以后吃了一惊，他记得第二次到红河发源地去的时候，曾经听见过这种声音。\n “是狐狸！”他叫道。\n “快去！”水手大声喊道。\n 大家分别拿起斧头、马枪和左轮枪、跳进升降梯、很快就到岸边了。\n 这一大群饥饿的狐狸是非常可怕的动物，尽管如此，他们毫不犹豫地冲上前去射出了第一排子弹，黑暗中发出几点亮光，就把对方吓退了。\n 主要的问题是要拦住这群强盗，不让它们往高地上去，要不然菜园和家禽场就都要遭到它们无情的蹂躏，难免会造成极大的损失，尤其对麦田来说，可能是无法弥补的损失；可是它们只有通过慈悲河的左岸才能侵入高地；如果把守住这条河与花岗石峭壁之间狭窄的堤岸，就可以抵挡住它们了。\n 大家都很明白这一点，在赛勒斯·史密斯的指挥下，他们都到达了指定的地点。这时候狐狸在朦胧中凶猛地乱窜。史密斯，史佩莱、赫伯特、潘克洛夫和纳布形成一道攻不破的防线。托普张开血盆大口，站在人们的前面，杰普挥动一根有节疤的大棍子，象拿着棍棒舞蹈似的，跟在托普的后面。\n 天色还很昏暗，只有当他们开枪的时候，才能借着左轮枪的火光看见对方，它们至少有一百只，眼睛通红，象燃烧着的火炭。\n “不能让它们过来！”潘克洛夫厉声喊道。\n “它们过不来的。”工程师应道。\n 它们没有过来，并不是它们不想过来——事实上后面的狐狸正在向前涌，而是居民们不断用左轮枪和斧头进行格斗不让它们过来。已经有几只狐狸被打死在地上了，可是它们的数目好象并没有减少，也许它们的后援正在源源不断地向桥上涌过来。\n 移民们不久就只好和狐狸肉搏了，他们受了几处伤，幸而伤势很轻。一只狐狸象山猫似的扑在纳布的背上，赫伯特一枪把它打死，这才把纳布救下来。托普愤怒地搏斗着，它冲过去咬住狐狸的脖子，一会儿就咬死一个。杰普勇猛地挥舞着武器，他们要想叫它留在后面也办不到。显然，因为它生来目光特别敏锐，在黑暗中也能够看见东西，因此它总是到战斗最激烈的地方去；它还不时发出一种尖叫声，表示极大的兴奋。\n 有一次它跑出去很远，在射击时火光一闪，才看见它正在五六只大狐狸的包围中沉着应战。\n 搏斗终于结束了，居民们经过整整两个钟头的激战，才获得胜利！天刚破晓，他们就看见对方越过桥头，向北窜去，纳布立刻跑过去把桥扯起来。等到晨曦照亮战场的时候，居民们发现沿岸一带的死狐狸足有五十多只。\n “杰普呢！”潘克洛夫喊道，“杰普上哪儿去了？”杰普失踪了。它的朋友纳布大声喊它，它还是第一次不回答朋友的呼唤。\n 大家都去找杰普，人人提心吊胆，怕在尸堆里发现它；他们把染红积雪的尸体扫在一边，最后在一堆死狐狸中间找到了杰普，这些死狐狸的肢体都已残缺不全，大概都是这个勇猛无敌的畜生拼命用棍子殴打的结果。\n 可怜的杰普手里还握着半截棍子，它在没有了武器以后，寡不敌众，胸前受了几处重伤。\n “它还活着呢。”纳布在它身旁弯下腰去喊道。\n “我们要把它救活，”水手说。“我们要把它当作自己人一样好好地看护它。”\n 杰普好象听得懂似的，它把脑袋倚在潘克洛夫的肩膀上，仿佛在向他致谢。水手自己也受伤了，但是他的伤势也和伙伴们一样，非常轻微；由于他们有精良的火器，对方几乎始终无法逼近。因此，只有猩猩的情况比较严重。\n 纳布和潘克洛夫把杰普放在升降梯里，它只是有时低低地呻吟着。大家慢慢地把它升到“花岗石宫”上去，然后从床上拿了一个垫子，让它躺在垫子上面，把它周身的伤痕都十分小心地洗干净了。看来杰普并没有受到致命伤，只不过由于流血过多，因此非常虚弱，创口包好以后不久，它就发起高烧来了。杰普躺了下来，饮食按严格规定供给，正如纳布所说的，“完全要象一个真人那样。”他们给它喝了几杯清凉的饮料，这是从“花岗石宫”的药草箱里取出的药泡成的。杰普最初很不安静，可是呼吸逐渐就正常起来了，大家让它安安稳稳地熟睡着。托普也常常蹑手蹑脚地——人们不妨这样说——来探望它的朋友，它对于大家的看护似乎表示很满意。杰普的一只手露在床铺外边，托普非常关怀地舔着它的手。\n 他们趁着白天把死狐狸运到远西森林里去，将它们全埋起来了。\n 这一次袭击险些儿造成惨痛的后果；对居民们说来是一次教训；从此以后，他们一定要问明白吊桥确实都已扯起来，决不可能受到侵犯以后，才敢上床睡觉。\n 焦急地等待了好几天，杰普终于逐渐好转了。由于它身体结实，才脱离了险境，热度逐渐减退，吉丁·史佩莱稍微懂得一些医道，这时候他告诉大家，它已经没有生命危险了。8月16日，杰普的饮食恢复正常了。纳布给它做了几份美味的菜肴，病“人”吃得津津有味；如果说杰普有什么毛病的话，那就是它稍微有些贪吃，这个缺点，纳布始终没有给它纠正过来。\n “你说该怎么办呢？”纳布对吉丁·史佩莱说，因为史佩莱常常劝他不要把猩猩宠坏了。“除了吃以外，可怜的杰普就没有别的乐趣了，我非常愿意在这方面为它效劳！”\n 躺了十天以后，到8月21日，小杰普起床了。它的伤势已经痊愈，肯定地说，再过不久，就可以恢复原有的体力和灵活。和所有大病初愈的人一样，它的胃口特别好，通讯记者让它尽量多吃，他相信猩猩有节制自己的本能，这种本能人类往往是没有的。纳布看见他的徒弟恢复了饭量，感到非常高兴。\n “尽量吃吧，我的杰普，”他说，“什么也不用留；你为我们流了血，我无论如何也要想法子让你恢复健康！”\n 8月25日，大家忽然听见纳布在喊他们。\n “史密斯先生、史佩莱先生、赫伯特先生、潘克洛夫，来啊！来啊！”\n 当时纳布正在杰普的房里，居民们听见他叫喊，就从餐厅里跑去。\n “怎么回事？”通讯记者问道。\n “瞧啊。”纳布笑着说。他们看见了什么呢？原来小杰普在“花岗石宫”的过道里，象一个顽皮的孩子似的，叉着两腿，一本正经地坐在那里静静地抽着烟！\n “我的烟斗，”潘克洛夫喊道，“它把我的烟斗拿去了！喂，我的好杰普，我把它送给你吧！抽吧，老兄，抽吧！”\n 杰普规规矩矩地喷着烟，好象感到非常满意。史密斯对这件事倒不觉得奇怪，他举了许多事实，说明养驯的人猿是能够养成吸烟的习惯的。\n 从这天起，小杰普就自备了一只烟斗，这是水手原有的烟斗，一向吊在他房里靠烟草的地方。杰普自己装烟，自己用火炭点烟，在猿猴之中，恐怕再也找不到比它更逍遥自在的了。忠实的杰普和善良的水手，原先就已结下了深厚的友谊，现在又有了共同的嗜好，不难理解，他们的友谊更进一步地加深了。\n “也许它真的是一个人，”潘克洛夫常常对纳布说。“要是有一天，它开口和我们说话，你会感到奇怪吗？”\n “不，决不会，”纳布答道。“相反地它一直没有和我们说过话，倒使我感到奇怪，现在它只差会说话了！”\n “如果有一天它对我说，‘潘克洛夫，我们换个烟斗吧，’”水手接着说，“我还是会觉得有趣的。”\n “是啊，”纳布说，“真可惜，它生来是个哑巴！”\n 九月初，残冬已尽，大家又开始忙着工作了。造船的工程进行得非常迅速，甲板已经完全铺好，船身的内部都用蒸气熏弯了的肋材——它的形状完全适合船的轮廓——牢固地连接起来。\n 木料非常富裕，潘克洛夫向工程师提议做一个双层的内壁，这样，船身就更牢固一些。\n 史密斯也没法估计将来会遇到什么情况，因此同意水手的意见，把船造得愈结实愈好。9月15日，船的内部和甲板完全竣工了。为了堵塞漏缝，他们把海藻晒干，作为填絮，用锤子把它们凿到木板的夹缝里去，又从松林里找来大量的松脂，熔化以后，涂在上面。\n 这只船驾驶起来非常简单。他们首先用石灰把沉重的花岗石块砌成压仓的底货，这些东西共重一万二千斤。\n 压仓的石块上铺了一层甲板，船的内部分成两间仓房；仓里有两条坐板，也可以当作橱柜。桅杆的底部支持着两仓之间的隔板，通过两个仓口就可以从甲板上到船仓里去。\n 潘克洛夫没费多大气力，就找到一棵适合做桅杆的树。这是一棵没有节的小枞树，只要把桅座砍成方形，顶部刨圆就行了。桅杆、舵和船身用的铁活都是在“石窟”里做好的，虽然粗糙一些，却很结实。在十月的第一周，终于连帆架、桅柱、帆杠、圆材、桨等等全做好了，大家一致同意作一次环岛的试航，好熟悉一下船的航行性能和可以利用的程度。\n 在这期间，一切必要的工作都照常进行着。摩弗仑羊和山羊新添了许多羊羔，必须让它们有吃有住，因此把畜栏扩大了。移民们也到过其他的地方，象蛤蜊场、养兔场、煤矿区和铁矿区，以及一直没有探索过的远西森林地带，那里有大量的飞禽走兽。他们发现了一些土生的植物，这些植物虽然不是那么迫切需要，却增加了“花岗石宫”疏菜储藏室里的品种。\n 这是一些番杏科植物，其中有的和好望角产的相似，长有肉厚的叶子，可以吃；有的种籽里含有淀粉质。\n 10月10日，新船下水了。造船的工作获得了完全的成功，潘克洛夫喜气洋洋。船上的索具装配完毕，用滚轮把船推到水边以后，潮水一涨，在移民们的欢呼中，船就浮起来了。潘克洛夫叫得特别起劲，他这时候真是得意忘形。再说，船造好以后，他的工作还不算完，因为还需要他来调度指挥。在大家一致推崇的情况下，他光荣地接受了“船长”的称号。为了使潘克洛夫船长满意，现在必须给船起一个名字，经过一再的商讨，最后大家都赞成用“乘风破浪”这个名字。潮水把乘风破浪号一浮起来，大家就看出它在水里非常平稳，很容易驾驶。试航决定就在当天举行，他们要离开海滨，作一次航行。天气很好，海面上风平浪静，特别是南部海滨一带，因为当天刮的是西北风。\n “全体上船。”潘克洛夫船长下了命令。他们在动身之前先吃了早饭，大家认为最好把食品带一些上船，因为他们这次航行也许要到傍晚才能回来。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯同样也急于要试一试这只船，因为，船的图样是他设计的，只是根据水手的意见，作了一些修改。但是他并不象潘克洛夫那样信心十足，水手后来没有再提到达抱岛去的事情，史密斯很希望他就此打消了这个念头。的确，让两三个伙伴乘着这只载重不过十五吨的小船去冒险，工程师是无论如何也不赞成的。\n 十点半钟，全体——托普和杰普也包括在内——都上了船，赫伯特把深深陷入慈悲河口沙滩的铁锚拔了起来。他们升起船帆，桅顶飘扬起林肯岛的旗号，乘风破浪号由潘克洛夫驾驶着，向海洋出发了。\n 船顺着从联合湾吹来的风向前行驶，正如潘克洛夫所说的，跑得非常快；它的主人们看了这种情况，都表示很满意。绕过遗物角和爪角以后，船长抢风而行，使船沿着荒岛的南岸前进；这时候可以看出，它的航行情况很好，没有超过风向的五个方位以外。海员们全都非常高兴，他们船的性能很好，必要的时候，准会给他们极大的帮助，只要风和日暖，航海一定顺利。\n 潘克洛夫现在使船离岸行驶，距气球港有三四英里。这时候他们看清了海岛的全貌，这是一幅新的景象，沿岸一带，从爪角到爬虫角，景色不断地变化着，森林里枞树的深色和其他树木的新绿形成鲜明的对比，一眼看去，满目苍翠，只有富兰克林山的顶峰，还积着皑皑的白雪。\n “多美啊！”赫伯特叫道。\n “是的，我们的岛又美又好，”潘克洛夫说。“我爱它就和爱我可怜的母亲似的。我们刚来的时候孤苦伶仃，可是现在我们这五个从天上掉下来的人还缺少什么呢？”\n “什么也不少，”纳布答道；“船长，什么也不少。”\n 于是这两位勇士欢呼三声，向海岛表示敬意！\n 这时候，吉丁·史佩莱一直靠着船桅，描绘着面前展开的活动画面。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯默默地看着。\n “史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫问道，“你觉得我们的船怎么样？”\n “好象不错。”工程师答道。\n “好！现在你认为它可以航行到比较远的地方去吗？”\n “到哪儿去，潘克洛夫？”\n “譬如说，到达抱岛去。”\n “朋友，”史密斯答道，“如果遇到什么紧急事故，我也不妨坐乘风破浪号到更远的地方去，可是你要知道，我眼看着你到达抱岛去，实在很不放心，既然不是非去不可，那又何必冒险呢。”\n “人人都想了解一下邻居的情况，”水手说，他的想法还没有变。“达抱岛是我们的邻居，而且是唯一的邻居！按礼貌也应该去拜访一次。”\n “啊唷，”史佩莱说，“我们的朋友潘克洛夫忽然也讲究起礼节来了！”\n “我什么也不讲究。”水手反驳道。工程师坚持反对使他很不高兴，然而他又不愿意让工程师替他担心。\n “你想，潘克洛夫，”史密斯接着说，“你一个人是不能到达抱岛去的。”\n “只要有一个人陪我去就够了。”\n “就算这样，”工程师答道，“你这么一来，林肯岛上的五个居民就有减少两个的危险。”\n “六个居民，”潘克洛夫说，“你忘记杰普了。”\n “七个，”纳布补充道，“托普也配得上一个。”\n “一点也不危险。史密斯先生，”潘克洛夫回答说。\n “也可能不危险，潘克洛夫；可是我要再说一遍，这样做实际上是一种不必要的冒险。”\n 固执的水手不回答了，话谈到这里暂时告一段落，但是他决定以后还要接着谈下去。他没有想到，一会儿就要发生一件事情，这件事情成全了他，而且要使最初只不过是一种不一定有意义的愿望一下子变成一桩非做不可的好事。\n 离岸航行了一会以后，乘风破浪号又向着气球港的海岸驶去。必须查探一下沙洲和礁石之间的侮峡，必要的时候，还得布置浮标，因为小溪将要成为停泊船只的港口。\n 他们离岸不过半英里，必须迎面斜兜着海风调向前进。由于风被一部分高地挡住了，乘风破浪号的速度非常缓慢，这时候，甚至船上的帆都鼓不起来了，海面平静得和镜子一样，只是偶尔有风吹过，才泛起一片波纹。\n 赫伯特一直站在船头上指示着在海峡中航行的方向，这时候他忽然大声喊道：“向风行驶，潘克洛夫，向风行驶！”\n “怎么回事，”水手问道，“有礁石吗？”\n “不……等一会儿，”赫伯特说，“我还看不清楚，再向着风……现在往右。”\n 赫伯特一面说，一面侧着身子，把一只手伸到水里去，捞出一件东西来，叫道：\n “一只瓶子！”\n 他手里拿着一只塞着软木塞的瓶子，捞这个瓶子的地方离海岸不过几锚链远。\n 赛勒斯·史密斯把瓶子接过来。他一言不发地拔开瓶塞，从里面拿出一张已经浸湿了的纸来，上面写着：\n “遇难人……达抱岛：西经153度，南纬37度11分。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/302/2901.html","bookId":188,"book":{"id":188,"title":"神秘岛 The Mysterious Island","description":"简介： The Mysterious
