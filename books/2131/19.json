{"id":94493,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Your name and reputation have preceded you,\" Captain Vaines explained to Drizzt as he led the drow and his companions to the boarding plank. Before them loomed the broken skyline of Baldur\u0027s Gate, the great port city halfway between Waterdeep and Calimport. Many structures lined the impressive dock areas, from low warehouses to taller buildings set with armaments and lookout positions, giving the region an uneven, jagged feel. \"My man found little trouble in gaining you passage on a river runner,\" Vaines went on. \"Discerning folk who\u0027d take a drow,\" Bruenor said dryly. \"Less so if they\u0027d take a dwarf,\" Drizzt replied without the slightest hesitation. \"Captained and crewed by dwarves,\" Vaines explained. That brought a groan from Drizzt and a chuckle from Bruenor. \"Captain Bumpo Thunderpuncher and his brother, Donat, and their two cousins thrice removed on their mother\u0027s side.\" \"Ye know them well,\" Catti-brie remarked. \"All who meet Bumpo meet his crew, and admittedly they are a hard foursome to forget,\" Vaines said. \"My man had little trouble in gaining your passage, as I said, for the dwarves know well the tale of Bruenor Battlehammer and the reclamation of Mithral Hall. And of his companions, including the dark elf.\" \"Bet ye\u0027d never see the day when ye\u0027d become a hero to a bunch o\u0027 dwarves,\" Bruenor remarked to Drizzt. \"Bet I\u0027d never see the day when I\u0027d want to,\" the ranger replied. The group came to the rail then, and Vaines moved aside, holding his arm out toward the plank. \"Farewell, and may your journey return you safely to your home,\" he said. \"If I am in port or nearby when you return to Baldur\u0027s Gate, perhaps we will sail together again.\" \"Perhaps,\" Regis politely replied, but he, like all the others, understood that, if they did get to Cadderly and get rid of the Crystal Shard, they meant to ask for Cadderly\u0027s help in bringing them magically to Luskan. They had approximately another two weeks of travel before them if they moved swiftly, but Cadderly could wind walk all the way back to Luskan in a matter of minutes. So said Drizzt and Cattibrie, who had taken such a walk with the powerful priest before. Then they could get on with the pressing business of finding Wulfgar. They entered Baldur\u0027s Gate without incident, and though Drizzt felt many stares following him, they were not ominous glares but looks of curiosity. The drow couldn\u0027t help contrast this experience with his other visit to the city, when he\u0027d gone in pursuit of Regis who had been whisked away to Calimport by Artemis Entreri. On that occasion, Drizzt, with Wulfgar beside him, had entered the city under the disguise of a magical mask that had allowed him to appear as a surface elf. \"Not much like the last time ye came through?\" Cattibrie, who knew well the tale of the first visit asked, seeing Drizzt\u0027s gaze. \"Always I wished to walk freely in the cities of the Sword Coast,\" Drizzt replied. \"It appears that our work with Captain Deudermont has granted me that privilege. Reputation has freed me from some of the pains of my heritage.\" \"Ye thinking that\u0027s a good thing?\" the so perceptive woman asked, for she had noted clearly the slight wince at the corner of Drizzt\u0027s eye when he made the claim. \"I do not know,\" Drizzt admitted. \"I like that I can walk freely now in most places without persecution.\" \"But it pains ye to think that ye had to earn the right,\" Catti-brie finished perfectly. \"Ye look at me, a human, and know that I had to earn no such thing. And at Bruenor and Regis, dwarf and halfling, and know that they can walk anywhere without earnin\u0027 a thing.\" \"I do not begrudge any of you that,\" Drizzt replied. \"But see their gazes?\" He looked around at the many people walking the streets of Baldur\u0027s Gate, almost every one turning to regard the drow curiously, some with admiration in their eyes, some with disbelief. \"So even though ye\u0027re walking free, ye\u0027re not walking free,\" the woman observed, and her nod told Drizzt that she understood then. Given the choice between facing the hatred of prejudice or the similarly ignorant looks of those viewing him as a curiosity piece, the latter seemed the better by far. But both were traps, both prisons, jailing Drizzt within the confines of the preceding reputation of a drow elf, of any drow elf, and thus limiting Drizzt to his heritage. \"Bah, they\u0027re just a stupid lot,\" Bruenor interrupted. \"Those who know you, know better,\" Regis added. Drizzt took it all in stride, all with a smile. Long ago he had abandoned any futile hopes of truly fitting in among the surface-dwellers-his kinfolk\u0027s well-earned reputation for treachery and catastrophe would always prevent that-and had learned instead to focus his energy on those closest to him, on those who had learned to see him beyond his physical trappings. And now here he was with three of his most trusted and beloved friends, walking freely, easily booking passage, and presenting no problems to them other than those created by the relic they had to carry. That was truly what Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had desired from the time he had come to know Cattibrie and Bruenor and Regis, and with them beside him how could the stares, be they of hatred or of ignorant curiosity, bother him? No, his smile was sincere; if Wulfgar was beside them, then all the world would be right for the drow, the king\u0027s treasure at the end of his long and difficult road. Rai\u0027gy rubbed his black hands together as the smallish creature began to form in the center of the magical circle he had drawn. He didn\u0027t know Gromph Baenre by anything more than reputation, but despite Jarlaxle\u0027s insistence that the archmage would be trustworthy on this issue, the mere fact that Gromph was drow and of the ruling house of Menzoberranzan worried Rai\u0027gy profoundly. The name Gromph had given him was supposedly of a minor denizen, easily controlled, but Rai\u0027gy couldn\u0027t know for certain until the creature appeared before him. A bit of treachery from Gromph could have had him opening a gate to a major demon, to Demogorgon himself, and the impromptu magical circle Rai\u0027gy had drawn here in the sewers of Calimport would hardly prove sufficient protection. The wizard-priest relaxed a bit as the creature took shape-the shape, as Gromph had promised, of an imp. Even without the magical circle, a wizard-priest as powerful as Rai\u0027gy would have little trouble in handling a mere imp. \"Who is it that calls my name?\" asked the imp in the guttural language of the Abyss, obviously more than a little perturbed and, both Rai\u0027gy and Jarlaxle noted, a bit trepidatious-and even more so when he noted that his summoners were drow elves. \"You should not bother Druzil. No, no, for he serves a great master,\" Druzil went on, speaking fluently in the drow tongue. \"Silence!\" Rai\u0027gy commanded, and the little imp was compelled to obey. The wizard-priest looked to Jarlaxle. \"Why do you protest?\" Jarlaxle asked Druzil. \"Is it not the desire of your kind to find access to this world?\" Druzil tilted his head and narrowed his eyes, a pensive yet still apprehensive pose. \"Ah, yes,\" the mercenary leader went on. \"But of late, you have been summoned not by friends, but by enemies, so I have been told. By Cadderly of Caradoon.\" Druzil bared his pointy teeth and hissed at the mention of the priest. That brought a smile to the faces of both dark elves. Gromph Baenre, it seemed, had not steered them wrong. \"We would like to pain Cadderly,\" Jarlaxle explained with a wicked grin. \"Would Druzil like to help?\" \"Tell me how,\" the imp eagerly replied. \"We need to know everything about the human,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"His appearance and demeanor, his history and present place. We were told that Druzil, above all others in the Abyss, knows the man.\" \"Hates the man,\" the imp corrected, and he seemed eager indeed. But suddenly he backed off, staring suspiciously at the two. \"I tell you, and then you dismiss me,\" he remarked. Jarlaxle looked to Rai\u0027gy, for they had anticipated such a reaction. The wizard-priest stood up, walked to the side in the tiny room, and pulled aside a screen, revealing a small kettle, bubbling and boiling. \"I am without a familiar,\" Rai\u0027gy explained. \"An imp would serve me well.\" Druzil\u0027s coal black eyes flared with red fires. \"Then we can pain Cadderly and so many other humans together,\" the imp reasoned. \"Does Druzil agree?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"Does Druzil have a choice?\" the imp retorted sarcastically. \"As to serving Rai\u0027gy, yes,\" the drow replied, and the imp was obviously surprised, as was Rai\u0027gy. \"As to revealing all that you know about Cadderly, no. It is too important, and if we must torment you for a hundred years, we shall.\" \"Then Cadderly would be dead,\" Druzil said dryly. \"The torment would remain pleasurable to me,\" Jarlaxle was quick to respond, and Druzil knew enough about dark elves to understand that this was no idle threat. \"Druzil wishes to pain Cadderly,\" the imp admitted, dark eyes sparkling. \"Then tell us,\" Jarlaxle said. \"Everything.\" Later on that day, while Druzil and Rai\u0027gy worked the magic spells that would bind them as master and familiar, Jarlaxle sat alone in the room he had taken in the subbasement of House Basadoni. He had indeed learned much from the imp, most important of all that he had no desire to bring his band anywhere near the one named Cadderly Bonaduce. This was to Druzil\u0027s ultimate dismay. The leader of the Spirit Soaring, armed with magic far beyond even Rai\u0027gy and Kimmuriel, might prove too great a foe. Even worse, Cadderly was apparently rebuilding an order of priests, surrounding himself with young and strong acolytes, enthusiastic idealists. \"The worst kind,\" Jarlaxle said as Entreri entered the room. \"Idealists,\" he explained to the assassin\u0027s perplexed expression. \"Above all else, I hate idealists.\" \"They are blind fools,\" Entreri agreed. \"They are unpredictable fanatics,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"Blind to danger and blind to fear as long as they think their path is according to the tenets of their particular god-figure.\" \"And the leader of this other guild is an idealist?\" a confused Entreri asked, for he thought he had been summoned to discuss his upcoming meeting with the remaining guilds of Calimport, to stop a war before it ever began. \"No, no, it is another matter,\" Jarlaxle explained, waving his hand dismissively. \"One that concerns my activities in Menzoberranzan and not here in Calimport. Let it not trouble you, for you have business more important by far.\" And Jarlaxle, too, put it out of his mind then, focusing on the more immediate problem. He had been surprised by Druzil\u0027s accounting of Cadderly, never imagining that this human would present such a problem. Though he held firm to his determination to keep his minions away from Cadderly, he was not dismayed, for he understood that Drizzt and his friends were still a long way from the great library known as the Spirit Soaring. It was a place Jarlaxle had no intention of ever allowing them to see. \"Yes, a pleasure meetin\u0027 ye! Oh, a pleasure, King Bruenor, and to yer kin, me blessin\u0027s,\" Bumpo Thun derpuncher, a rotund and short little dwarf with a fiery orange beard and a huge and flat nose that was pushed over to one side of his ruddy face, said to Bruenor for perhaps the tenth time since Bottom Feeder had put out of Baldur\u0027s Gate. The dwarven vessel was a square-bottomed, shallow twenty footer with two banks of oars-though only one was normally in use-and a long aft pole for steering and for pushing off the bottom, Bumpo and his equally rotund and bumbling brother Donat had fallen all over themselves at the sight of the Eighth King of Mithral Hall. Bruenor had seemed honestly surprised that his name had grown to such proportions, even among his own race. Now, though, that surprise was turning to mere annoyance, as Bumpo and Donat and their two oar-pulling cousins, Yipper and Quipper Fishsquisher, continued to rain compliments, promises of fealty, and general slobber all over him. Sitting back from the dwarves, Drizzt and Catti-brie smiled. The ranger alternated his looks between Catti-brie how he loved to gaze upon her when she wasn\u0027t looking-and the tumult of the dwarves. Then Regis- who was lying on his belly at the prow, head hanging over the front of the boat, his hands drawing pictures in the water-and back behind them to the diminishing skyline of Baldur\u0027s Gate. Again he thought about his passage through the city, as easy a time of it as the drow had ever known, including those occasions when he had worn the magical mask. He had earned this peace; they all had. Once this mission was completed and the crystal shard was safely in the hands of Cadderly, and once they had recovered Wulfgar and helped him through his darkness, then perhaps they could journey the wide world again, for no better reason than to see what lay over the next horizon and with no troubles beyond the fawning of bumbling dwarves. Truly Drizzt wore a contented smile, finding hope again, for Wulfgar and for them all. He could never have dreamed that he would ever find such a life on that day decades before when he had walked out of Menzoberranzan. It occurred to him then that his father, Zaknafein, who had died to give him this chance, was watching him at that moment from another plane, a goodly place for one as deserving as Zak. Watching him and smiling.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-19.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
