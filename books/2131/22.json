{"id":94496,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"We always put in here,\" Bumpo Thunder-puncher explained as Bottom Feeder bumped hard against a fallen tree overhanging the river. The jarring shock nearly sent Regis and Bruenor tumbling off the side of the boat. \"Don\u0027t like carrying too many supplies all at once,\" the rotund dwarf explained. \"Me brother and cousins eat \u0027em to dangnabbit fast!\" Drizzt nodded-they did indeed need some food, mostly because of the gluttonous dwarves-and glanced warily at the trees clustered about the river. Several times over the previous two days the friends had noted movements shadowing their journey, and once Regis had seen the pursuers clearly enough to identify them as a band of goblins. By the dogged pursuit, and any pursuit longer than a few hours would be considered dogged by goblin standards, it seemed as if Crenshinibon was calling out yet again. \"How long to resupply and get back out?\" the drow asked. \"Oh, not more\u0027n an hour,\" Bumpo replied. \"Half that time,\" Bruenor bade him. \"And me and me halfling friend\u0027ll help.\" He nodded to Drizzt and Catti-brie then, and they took the signal; Bruenor hadn\u0027t included them because he knew they had to go out and do a bit of scouting. It didn\u0027t take the seasoned pair of hunters long to find goblin sign, the tracks of at least a score of the wicked little creatures. And not far away. The goblins had apparently veered from the river at this point, and when Drizzt and Catti-brie moved to higher ground, looking east to see more of the silvery snake that was the river bending about up ahead, the two understood the goblins\u0027 reasoning. Bottom Feeder had been going generally north for the past hour, for the river hooked at this juncture, but the boat would soon turn back east, then south, then back to the east once more. Crossing the fairly open ground moving directly to the east, the goblin band would get to the banks in the east far ahead of the dwarves\u0027 boat. \"Ah, they\u0027re knowing the river then,\" Bumpo said when Drizzt and Catti-brie returned to report their findings. \"They\u0027ll be beatin\u0027 us to the spot, and the river\u0027s narrower there, not wide enough for us to avoid a fight.\" Bruenor turned a serious gaze upon Drizzt. \"How many\u0027re ye figuring, elf?\" he asked. \"A score,\" Drizzt replied. \"Perhaps as many as thirty.\" \"Let\u0027s be picking our place for fighting, then,\" Bruenor said. \"If we\u0027re to fight, then let it be on ground of our own choosing.\" Everyone around noted the lack of dismay in Bruenor\u0027s tone. \"They\u0027ll be seein\u0027 the boat a long way off,\" Bumpo explained. \"If we\u0027re to keep it here, tied up, they might be catching on.\" Drizzt was shaking his head before the dwarf ever finished. \"Bottom Feeder will go along as planned,\" he explained, \"but without we three.\" He indicated Bruenor and Catti-brie, then moved near to Regis, unstrapping his belt so that he could slide off the pouch that held the Crystal Shard. \"This remains on the boat,\" he explained to the halfling. \"Above all else, keep it safe.\" \"So they will come after the boat, and you three will come after them,\" Regis reasoned, and Drizzt nodded. \"Be quick, if you please,\" the halfling added. \"What\u0027re ye grumbling over, Rumblebelly?\" Bruenor asked with a chuckle. \"Ye just loaded a ton o\u0027 food on the boat, and knowing ye the way I do I\u0027m figuring there won\u0027t be much left for me when we get back aboard!\" Regis looked down doubtfully at the pouch, but his face did brighten as he turned to regard the supply-laden boat. They parted company then, Bumpo, his crew, and Regis pushed off from the impromptu tree landing back into the swift currents. Before they had gone far Drizzt, on the riverbank, took out his onyx figurine, set it down, and called for his panther companion. Then he and his three companions set off, running straight to the east, following the same course as the goblin troupe. Guenhwyvar took the point position, blending into the brush, barely seeming to stir the grasses and bushes as she passed. Drizzt came along next, working as liaison between the cat and the other two, who brought up the rear, Bruenor with his axe comfortably across his shoulder and Catti-brie with Taulmaril in hand, arrow notched and ready. \"Well, if we\u0027re to be fightin\u0027, then this\u0027ll be the place,\" Donat said a short while later as Bottom Feeder rounded a bend in the river, crossing into a region of narrower banks and swifter current and with many tree limbs overhanging the water. Regis took one look at the area and groaned, not liking the prospects at all. Goblins could be anywhere, he realized, taking a good measure of the many bushes and hillocks. He took little comfort in the apparent giddiness of the four dwarves, for he had been around dwarves long enough to know that they were always happy before a fight, no matter the prospects. And even more disconcerting to the halfling came a voice within his head, a tempting, teasing voice, reminding him that with a word he could construct a crystalline tower-a tower that a thousand goblins couldn\u0027t breach-if Regis just took control of the crystal shard. The goblins wouldn\u0027t even try to take the tower, Regis knew, for Crenshinibon would work with him to control the little wretches. They could not resist. Drizzt, looking back with his back against a tree some distance ahead of Bruenor and Catti-brie, motioned for the woman to hold her shot. He, too, had seen the goblin on the branch above, a goblin intent on the river ahead and taking no note of the approaching friends. No need to tell the whole troupe that danger was about, the ranger decided, and Cattibrie\u0027s thunderous bow would certainly raise the general alarm. So up the tree went the drow ranger, one scimitar in hand. With amazing stealth and equal agility, he made a branch level with the goblin. Then, balancing perfectly without using his free hand, he closed suddenly in five quick steps. The drow clamped his empty hand around the creature\u0027s side, through bow and bowstring and over the surprised goblin\u0027s mouth, and drove his scimitar into the creature\u0027s back, hooking the blade upward as he went to slice smoothly through heart and lung. He held the goblin for a few seconds, letting it descend into the complete blackness of death, then carefully set it down over the branch, laying the crude bow atop it. Drizzt looked all around for Guenhwyvar, but the panther was nowhere to be seen. He had instructed the cat to hold back until the main fighting started and trusted that Guenhwyvar would do as told. That fight fast approached, Drizzt knew, for the goblins were all about, huddled in bushes and in trees near to the riverbank. He didn\u0027t like the prospects for a quick victory here; the region was too jumbled, with too many physical barriers and too many hiding holes. He would have liked the luxury of spending an hour or more locating all the goblins. But then Bottom Feeder came into sight, rounding a bend not so far away. Drizzt looked back to his waiting friends, motioning strongly for them to come on fast. A roar from Bruenor and a sizzling arrow from Taulmaril led the way, Catti-brie\u0027s missile cutting by the base of Drizzt\u0027s tree, diving through some underbrush and taking a goblin in the hip, dropping it squirming to the ground. Three other goblins emerged from that same brush, running out and screaming wildly. Those screams fast diminished as the drow, now holding both his deadly blades, leaped down atop them. He struck hard as he crashed in, stabbing one to the side, and felling the one under him by tucking the hilt of his second blade tight against his torso and using his momentum to drive it halfway through the unfortunate creature. And he nearly collided in midair with another soaring, dark form. Guenhwyvar, leaping strong, crossed by the descending drow and crashed into yet another bush atop a shadowy goblin form. The one goblin of the three to escape Drizzt\u0027s initial leap staggered to the side against the trunk of the same tree from which Drizzt had jumped and turned about, spear raised to throw. It heard the cursing howl and tried to turn its angle to the newest foe, but Bruenor came in too quick, moving within the sharpened tip of the long weapon and transferring his momentum into his overhead axe with a skidding stop, every muscle in his body snapping forward. \"Damn!\" the dwarf grumbled, realizing that it might take him some time to extricate the embedded weapon from the split skull. Even as the dwarf tugged and twisted, Catti-brie came running by, dropping to one knee and letting fly another arrow. This one blasted a goblin from a tree. She dropped her bow and in one fluid motion drew out Khazid\u0027hea, her powerfully enchanted sword. The blade glowing fiercely, she ran on. Still Bruenor tugged. Drizzt, both the other two goblins quite dead, leaped up and ran on, disappearing through a small cluster of trees. Up ahead, Guenhwyvar ran up the side of a tree, and the terrified goblins on the lowest branches both threw their spears errantly and tried to leap to the ground. One made it; the other got caught in midair by a swiping panther claw and was pulled, squirming wildly, back up to its death. \"Damn,\" Bruenor said again, tugging and tugging, missing all the fun. \"I gotta hit the stinkin\u0027 things softer!\" He couldn\u0027t raise the crystal tower on the boat, of course, but right over the side, even in the river. Yes, the bottom levels of the structure might be under the water, but Crenshinibon would still show him a way in. \"They got spears!\" Bumpo Thunderpuncher cried. \"To the wall! To the wall!\" On cue, the dwarf captain and his three kinsfolk dived down to the deck and rolled up against the blocking side wall closest to the goblin-infested shore. Donat, who got there first, quickly broke open a wooden locker, each dwarf taking up a crossbow and huddling tight against the shielding planking while loading. All of the movement finally caught Regis\u0027s eye, and he shook away his visions of a crystal tower, hardly believing that he could have even considered raising the thing, and looked, quite startled, at the dwarves. He looked up as the boat drifted beneath an overhanging limb and saw a goblin there, its arm poised to throw. The four dwarves rolled in unison to their backs, lining up their crossbows and letting fly. Each bolt hit its mark, driving into the goblin and jerking it up and over so that it tumbled into the river behind the floating craft. But not before it had thrown the spear and thrown it well. Regis yelped and tried to dodge, but too late. He felt the spear dive into the back of his shoulder. The halfling heard, with sickening clarity, the tip of it prodding right through him to knock against the deck. He was down, facedown, and he heard himself howling, though his voice came from no conscious act. Then he felt the uneven edges of the decking planks as the dwarves pulled him to the side, and he heard, as if from a great distance, Donat crying, \"They killed him! They killed him to death!\" And then he was alone, and so cold, and he heard the splashing of water as swimming goblins made the edge of the boat. Down from a high branch came the panther, graceful and beautiful, a soaring black arrow. She went past one goblin, one paw kicking out swiftly enough to rake out the oblivious creature\u0027s throat, and then crashed upon another pair, bearing one down under her great weight and ripping the life from it in an instant, then skipping on to the next before it could rise and flee. The goblin rolled to its back, flailed its arms wildly to try to fend off the great cat. But Guenhwyvar was too strong and too fast and soon got her maw clamped about the creature\u0027s throat. Not far to the side, Drizzt and Catti-brie, independently in pursuit of goblins, discovered each other in a small clearing and found that they had become ringed by goblins, who, seeing a sudden advantage, leaped out of the brush and encircled the pair. \"A bit o\u0027 good luck, I\u0027d say,\" Catti-brie remarked with a wink to her friend, and they fell together defensively, back-to-back. The goblins tried to coordinate their attacks, calling to each other, opposite ones coming in at the same time, while those beside them waited to see if the first attack might leave the two humans vulnerable. They simply didn\u0027t understand. Drizzt and Catti-brie rolled about each other\u0027s back, thus changing their angles of attack, the drow going after those goblins that had come in at Catti-brie and vice versa. Out Drizzt came, scimitars flashing in circling motions, hooking inside spear shafts and turning them harmlessly aside. A subtle shift in wrist angle, a quick step forward, and both goblins staggered backward, guts torn. Across the way Catti-brie went down low under the high thrust of one spear and sent Khazid\u0027hea slashing across, the wickedly edged blade taking the goblin\u0027s leg off cleanly at the knee. A goblin to the side tried to adjust its spear angle down at the woman, but she caught the weapon shaft with her free hand and turned it aside, using it as leverage to propel her up and out, a single thrust taking the creature in the chest. \"Straight on!\" Drizzt yelled, rushing by and hooking Catti-brie under the shoulder, helping her to her feet and pushing her along in his charge, their momentum shattering the line of the frightened creatures. Those behind didn\u0027t dare follow that charge, except for one, and thus Drizzt knew that Crenshinibon had crazed this one. In the span of three heartbeats it lay dead. Still behind the main fighting, Bruenor heard the commotion, and that made him madder than ever. Twisting and pulling, tugging with all his strength, the dwarf nearly toppled as his axe came free-almost free, he realized with revulsion, for instead of pulling the heavy blade from the creature\u0027s skull he had torn the dead goblin\u0027s head right off. \"Well, that\u0027s pretty,\" he said with disgust, and then he had no more time to complain as a pair of goblins crashed out of the brush near to him. He hit the closest hard, a roundabout throw that slammed its kin\u0027s head right into its belly and sent it staggering backward. Weaponless, Bruenor took a hit from the second goblin, a club smash across his shoulders that stung but hardly slowed him. He leaped in close, moving right before the goblin, and snapped his forehead into the creature\u0027s face, sending it reeling and taking its club from its weakened grasp as it staggered. Before the goblin could retrieve its bearings, that club smashed down hard once, twice, thrice, and left the thing twitching helplessly on the ground. Bruenor spun about and launched the club into the legs of the first goblin as it tried to charge at his back, tripping the creature and sending it headlong to the ground. Bruenor quickstepped over it, back to the brush to retrieve his axe. \"Enough playin\u0027!\" the dwarf roared. Finesse aside, he slammed his axe against the nearest tree trunk, shattering away the remnants of the head. Up and spinning, the goblin took one look at the ferocious dwarf and his axe, took one look at the decapitated remains of Bruenor\u0027s first kill, and turned and ran. \"No ye don\u0027t!\" the dwarf howled, and he let fly an overhead throw that sent his axe spinning hard into the goblin\u0027s back, dropping it facedown into the dirt. Bruenor ran by, thinking to pull the axe free in full stride, heading to rejoin his companions. It was stuck again, this time hooked on the dying goblin\u0027s spine. \"Orc-brained, troll-smellin\u0027, bug-eater!\" Bruenor cursed. Donat worked hard over Regis, trying to hold the spear shaft steady so the embedded weapon wouldn\u0027t do any more damage, while his three kinfolk rushed about frantically, working furiously themselves to keep Bottom Feeder free of goblins. One creature nearly made the deck, but Bumpo smashed his crossbow across its face, shattering the weapon and the goblin\u0027s jaw. The dwarf howled in glee, lifted the stunned creature above his head and threw it into two others that were trying to come over the side, dropping all three back into the water. His two cousins proved equally effective and equally damaging to expensive crossbows, but the boat stayed clear of goblins, soon outdistancing those giving stubborn pursuit in the swift current. That allowed Bumpo to take up Donat\u0027s crossbow, the only one still working, and pluck a few in the water. Most of the creatures did make the other bank but had seen enough of the fight-too much, actually-and simply ran off into the underbrush. Bruenor planted his heavy boots on the back of the still-groaning goblin, spat in both his hands, took up his axe handle, and gave a great tug, ripping the head and half the goblin\u0027s backbone free. The dwarf went over in a backward roll to wind up sitting in the dirt. \"Oh, even prettier,\" he remarked, noting the torn creature and the length of spine lying across his extended legs. He shook his head and hopped to his feet, running fast to join his friends, but by the time he arrived the battle had ended. Drizzt and Catti-brie stood amidst several dead creatures, and Guenhwyvar circled about, searching for any others. But those held in Crenshinibon\u0027s mental grasp were already dead, and those still of free will were long gone. \"Tell the stupid crystal shard to call in thicker-skinned creatures,\" Bruenor grumbled. He gave Drizzt a sidelong glance as they headed for the riverbank. \"Ye\u0027re sure we got to get rid of that thing?\" Drizzt only smiled and ran along. One goblin did come out of the river on this side, but Guenhwyvar buried it before the friends ever got close. Up ahead, Bumpo maneuvered Bottom Feeder into a small side pool out of the main current. The three friends laughed all the way, replaying the battle and talking lightheartedly about how good it was to be back on the road. Their expressions changed abruptly when they saw Regis lying on the deck, pale and very still. From a dark room in the subbasement of House Basadoni, Jarlaxle and his wizard-priest assistant watched it all. \"This could not be any easier,\" the mercenary leader remarked with a laugh. He turned to Rai\u0027gy. \"Find yourself a human persona in the guise of a priest much like Cadderly and in the same ceremonial dress. Not his hat, though,\" the mercenary added after a short pause. \"That might constitute rank, I believe, or prove more a matter of Cadderly\u0027s personal taste.\" \"But Kimmuriel has gone for Baeltimazifas,\" Rai\u0027gy protested. \"And you shall accompany the doppleganger to Drizzt and his companions,\" Jarlaxle explained, \"as a student of Cadderly Bonaduce\u0027s Spirit Soaring library. Prepare spells of powerful healing.\" Rai\u0027gy\u0027s eyes widened with surprise. \"I am to pray to Lady Lolth for spells with which to heal a halfling?\" he asked incredulously. \"And you believe that she will grant me such spells, given that intent?\" Jarlaxle, supremely confident, nodded. \"She will, because bestowing such spells shall further the cause of her drow,\" he explained, and he smiled widely, knowing that the outcome of the battle had just made his life a lot easier and much more interesting.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-22.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
