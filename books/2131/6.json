{"id":94480,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"LaValle walked to his private suite in the guild house late that morning after meeting with Quentin Bodeau and Chalsee Anguaine. Dog Perry was supposed to attend, and he was the one LaValle truly wanted to see, but Dog had sent word that he would not be coming, that he was out on the streets learning more about the dangerous Entreri.\n In truth, the meeting proved nothing more than a gathering to calm the nerves of Quentin Bodeau. The guildmaster wanted reassurances that Entreri wouldn\u0027t merely show up and murder him. Chalsee Anguaine, in the manner of a cocky young man, promised to defend Quentin with his life. This LaValle knew to be an obvious lie. LaValle argued that Entreri wouldn\u0027t work that way, that he would not come in and kill Quentin without first learning all of Quentin\u0027s ties and associates and how powerfully the man held the guild.\n \"Entreri is never reckless,\" LaValle had explained. \"And the scenario you fear would indeed be reckless.\"\n By the time LaValle had turned to leave, Bodeau felt better and expressed his sentiment that he would feel better still if Dog Perry, or someone else, merely killed the dangerous man. It would never be that easy, LaValle knew, but he had kept the thought silent.\n As soon as he entered his rooms, a suite of four with a large greeting room, a private study to the right, bedroom directly behind, and an alchemy lab and library to the left, the wizard felt as if something was amiss. He suspected Dog Perry to be the source of the trouble-the man did not trust him and had even privately, though surely subtly, accused him of the intent to side with Entreri should it come to blows.\n Had the man come in here when he knew LaValle to be at the meeting with Quentin? Was he still here, hiding, crouched with weapon in hand?\n The wizard looked back at the door and saw no signs that the lock-and the door was always locked-had been tripped, or that his traps had been defeated. There was one other way into the place, an outside window, but LaValle had placed so many glyphs and wards upon it, scattering them in several different places, that anyone crawling through would have been shocked with lightning, burned three different times, and frozen solid on the sill. Even if an intruder managed to survive the magical barrage, the explosions would have been heard throughout this entire level of the guild house, bringing soldiers by the score.\n Reassured by simple logic and by a defensive spell he placed upon his body to make his skin resistant to any blows, LaValle started for his private study.\n The door opened before he reached it, Artemis Entreri standing calmly within.\n LaValle did well to stay on his feet, for his knees nearly buckled with weakness.\n \"You knew that I had returned,\" Entreri said easily, stepping forward and leaning against the jamb. \"Did you not expect that I would pay a visit to an old friend?\"\n The wizard composed himself and shook his head, looking back at the door. \"Door or window?\" he asked.\n \"Door, of course,\" Entreri replied. \"I know how well you protect your windows.\"\n \"The door, as well,\" LaValle said dryly, for obviously he hadn\u0027t protected it well enough.\n Entreri shrugged. \"You still use that lock and trap combination you had upon your previous quarters,\" he explained, holding up a key. \"I suspected as much, since I heard that you were overjoyed when you discovered that the items had survived when the dwarf knocked the door in on your head.\"\n \"How did you get a-\" LaValle started to ask.\n \"I got you the lock, remember?\" Entreri answered.\n \"But the guild house is well defended by no soldiers known by Artemis Entreri,\" the wizard argued.\n \"The guild house has its secret leaks,\" the assassin quietly replied.\n \"But my door,\" LaValle went on. \"There are . . . were other traps.\"\n Entreri put on a bored expression, and LaValle got the point.\n \"Very well,\" the wizard said, moving past Entreri into the study and motioning for the assassin to follow. \"I can have a fine meal delivered, if you so desire.\"\n Entreri took a seat opposite LaValle and shook his head. \"I came not for food, merely for information,\" he explained. \"They know I am in Calimport.\"\n \"Many guilds know,\" LaValle confirmed with a nod. \"And yes, I did know. I saw you through my crystal ball as, I am sure, have many of the wizards of the other pashas. You have not exactly been traveling from shadow to shadow.\"\n \"Should I be?\" Entreri asked. \"I came in with no enemies, as far as I know, and with no intent to make any.\"\n LaValle laughed at the absurd notion. \"No enemies?\" he asked. \"Ever have you made enemies. The creation of enemies is the obvious side product of your dark profession.\" His chuckle died fast when he looked carefully at the not-amused assassin, the wizard suddenly realizing that he was mocking perhaps the most dangerous man in all the world.\n \"Why did you scry me?\" Entreri asked.\n LaValle shrugged and held up his hands as if he didn\u0027t understand the question. \"That is my job in the guild,\" he answered.\n \"So you informed the guildmaster of my return?\"\n \"Pasha Quentin Bodeau was with me when your image came into the crystal ball,\" LaValle admitted.\n Entreri merely nodded, and LaValle shifted uncomfortably.\n \"I did not know it would be you, of course,\" the wizard explained. \"If I had known, I would have contacted you privately before informing Bodeau to learn your intent and your wishes.\"\n \"You are a loyal one,\" Entreri said dryly, and the irony was not lost on LaValle.\n \"I make no pretensions or promises,\" the wizard replied. \"Those who know me understand that I do little to upset the balance of power about me and serve whoever has weighted his side of the scale the most.\"\n \"A pragmatic survivor,\" Entreri said. \"Yet did you not just tell me that you would have informed me had you known? You do make a promise, wizard, a promise to serve. And yet, would you not be breaking that promise to Quentin Bodeau by warning me? Perhaps I do not know you as well as I had thought. Perhaps your loyalty cannot be trusted.\"\n \"I make a willing exception for you,\" LaValle stammered, trying to find a way out of the logic trap. He knew beyond a doubt that Entreri would try to kill him if the assassin believed that he could not be trusted.\n And he knew beyond a doubt that if Entreri tried to kill him, he would be dead.\n \"Your mere presence means that whichever side you serve has weighted the scale in their favor,\" he explained. \"Thus, I would never willingly go against you.\"\n Entreri didn\u0027t respond other than to stare hard at the man, making LaValle shift uncomfortably more than once. Entreri, having little time for such games and with no real intention of harming LaValle, broke the tension, though, and quickly. \"Tell me of the guild in its present incarnation,\" he said. \"Tell me of Bodeau and his lieutenants and how extensive his street network has become.\"\n \"Quentin Bodeau is a decent man,\" LaValle readily complied. \"He does not kill unless forced into such a position and steals only from those who can afford the loss. But many under him, and many other guilds, perceive this compassion as weakness, and thus the guild has suffered under his reign. We are not as extensive as we were when Pook ruled or when you took the leadership from the halfling Regis.\" He went on to detail the guild\u0027s area of influence, and the assassin was indeed surprised at how much Pook\u0027s grand old guild had frayed at the edges. Streets that had once been well within Pook\u0027s domain were far out of reach now, for those avenues considered borderlands between various operations were much closer to the guild house.\n Entreri hardly cared for the prosperity or weakness of Bodeau\u0027s operation. This was a survival call and nothing more. He was only trying to get a feeling for the current layout of Calimport\u0027s underbelly so that he might not inadvertently bring the wrath of any particular guild down upon him.\n LaValle went on to tell of the lieutenants, speaking highly of the potential of young Chalsee and warning Entreri in a deadly serious tone, but one that hardly seemed to stir the assassin, of Dog Perry.\n \"Watch him closely,\" LaValle said again, noting the assassin\u0027s almost bored expression. \"Dog Perry was beside me when we scried you, and he was far from happy to see Artemis Entreri returned to Calimport. Your mere presence poses a threat to him, for he commands a fairly high price as an assassin, and not just for Quentin Bodeau.\" Still garnering no obvious response, LaValle pressed even harder. \"He wants to be the next Artemis Entreri,\" the wizard said bluntly.\n That brought a chuckle from the assassin, not one of doubt concerning Dog Perry\u0027s abilities to fulfill his dream or one of any flattery. Entreri was amused by the fact that this Dog Perry hardly understood that which he sought, for if he did, he would turn his desires elsewhere.\n \"He may see your return as more than an inconvenience,\" LaValle warned. \"Perhaps as a threat, or even worse ... as an opportunity.\"\n \"You do not like him,\" Entreri reasoned.\n \"He is a killer without discipline and thus hardly predictable,\" the wizard replied. \"A blind man\u0027s flying arrow. If I knew for certain that he was coming after me, I would hardly fear him. It is the often irrational actions of the man that keep us all a bit worried.\"\n \"I hold no aspirations for Bodeau\u0027s position,\" Entreri assured the wizard after a long moment of silence. \"Nor do I have any intention of impaling myself on the dagger of Dog Perry. Thus you will show no disloyalty to Bodeau by keeping me informed, wizard, and I expect at least that much from you.\"\n \"If Dog Perry comes after you, you will be told,\" LaValle promised, and Entreri believed him. Dog Perry was an upstart, a young hopeful who desired to strengthen his reputation with a single thrust of his dagger. But LaValle understood the truth of Entreri, the assassin knew, and while the wizard might become nervous indeed if he invoked the wrath of Dog Perry, he would find himself truly terrified if ever he learned that Artemis Entreri wanted him dead.\n Entreri sat a moment longer, considering the paradox of his reputation. Because of his years of work, many might seek to kill him, but, for the same reasons, many others would fear to go against him and indeed would work for him.\n Of course, if Dog Perry did manage to kill him, then LaValle\u0027s loyalty to Entreri would come to an abrupt end, transferred immediately to the new king assassin.\n To Artemis Entreri it all seemed so perfectly useless.\n \"You do not see the possibilities here,\" Dog Perry scolded, working hard to keep his voice calm, though in truth he wanted to throttle the nervous young man.\n \"Have you heard the stories?\" Chalsee Anguaine retorted. \"He has killed everything from guildmasters to battle mages. Everyone he has decided to kill is dead.\"\n Dog Perry spat in disgust. \"That was a younger man,\" he replied. \"A man revered by many guilds, including the Basadoni House. A man of connections and protection, who had many powerful allies to assist in his assassinations. Now he is alone and vulnerable, and no longer possessed of the quickness of youth.\"\n \"We should bide our time and learn more about him and discover why he has returned,\" Chalsee reasoned.\n \"The longer we wait, the more Entreri will rebuild his web,\" Dog Perry argued without hesitation. \"A wizard, a guildmaster, spies on the street. No, if we wait then we cannot go against him without considering the possibility that our actions will begin a guild war. You understand the truth of Bodeau, of course, and recognize that under his leadership we would not survive such a war.\"\n \"You remain his principal assassin,\" Chalsee argued.\n Dog Perry chuckled at the thought. \"I follow opportunities,\" he corrected. \"And the opportunity I see before me now is one that cannot be ignored. If I-if we-kill Artemis Entreri, we will command his previous position.\"\n \"Guildless?\"\n \"Guildless,\" Dog Perry answered honestly. \"Or better described as tied to many guilds. A sword for the highest bidder.\"\n \"Quentin Bodeau would not accept such a thing,\" Chalsee said. \"He will lose two lieutenants, thus weakening his guild.\"\n \"Quentin Bodeau will understand that because his lieutenants now hire to more powerful guilds, his own position will be better secured,\" Dog Perry replied.\n Chalsee considered the optimistic reasoning for a moment, then shook his head doubtfully. \"Bodeau would then be vulnerable, perhaps fearing that his own lieutenants might strike against him at the request of another guildmaster.\"\n \"So be it,\" Dog Perry said coldly. \"You should be very careful how tightly you tie your future to the likes of Bodeau. The guild erodes under his command, and eventually another guild will absorb us. Those willing to let the strongest conquer may find a new home. Those tied by foolish loyalty to the loser will have their bodies picked clean by beggars in the gutter.\"\n Chalsee looked away, not enjoying this conversation in the least. Until the previous day, until they had learned that Artemis Entreri had returned, he had thought his life and career fairly secure. He was rising through the ranks of a reasonably strong guild. Now Dog Perry seemed intent on upping the stakes, on reaching for a higher level. While Chalsee could understand the allure, he wasn\u0027t certain of the true potential. If they succeeded against Entreri, he did not doubt Dog Perry\u0027s prediction, but the mere thought of going after Artemis Entreri...\n Chalsee had been but a boy when Entreri had last left Calimport, had been connected to no guilds and knew none of the many Entreri had slain. By the time Chalsee had joined the underworld circuit, others had claimed the position of primary assassins in Calimport: Marcus the Knife of Pasha Wroning\u0027s Guild; the independent Clarissa and her cohorts who ran the brothels serving the nobility of the region- yes, Clarissa\u0027s enemies seemed to simply disappear. Then there was Kadran Gordeon of the Basadoni Guild, and perhaps most deadly of all, Slay Targon, the battle mage. None of them had come near to erasing the reputation of Artemis Entreri, even though the end of Entreri\u0027s previous Calimport career had been marred by the downfall of the guildmaster he was supposedly serving and by his reputed inability to defeat a certain nemesis, a drow elf, no less.\n And now Dog Perry wanted to catapult himself to the ranks of those four notorious assassins with a single kill, and in truth, the plan sounded plausible to Chalsee.\n Except, of course, for the little matter of actually killing Entreri.\n \"The decision is made,\" Dog Perry said, seemingly sensing Chalsee\u0027s private thoughts. \"I am going against him ... with or without your assistance.\"\n The implicit threat behind those words was not lost on Chalsee. If Dog Perry meant to have any chance against Entreri, there could be no neutral parties. When he proclaimed his intentions to Chalsee, he was bluntly inferring that Chalsee had to either stand with him or against him, to stand in his court or in Entreri\u0027s. Considering that Chalsee didn\u0027t even know Entreri and feared the man as much as an ally as an enemy, it didn\u0027t seem much of a choice.\n The two began their planning immediately. Dog Perry insisted that Artemis Entreri would be dead within two days.\n \"The man is no enemy,\" LaValle assured Quentin later that same night as the two walked the corridors leading to the guildmaster\u0027s private dining hall. \"His return to Calimport was not predicated by any desire to reclaim the guild.\"\n \"How can you know?\" the obviously nervous leader asked. \"How can anyone know the mind-set of that one? Ever has he survived through unpredictability.\"\n \"There you are wrong,\" LaValle replied. \"Entreri has ever been predictable because he makes no pretense of that which he desires. I have spoken to him.\"\n The admission had Quentin Bodeau spinning about to face the wizard directly. \"When?\" he stuttered. \"Where? You have not left the guild house all this day.\"\n LaValle smiled and tilted his head as he regarded the man-the man who had just foolishly admitted that he was monitoring LaValle\u0027s movements. How frightened Quentin must be to go to such lengths. Still, the wizard knew, Quentin realized that LaValle and Entreri were old companions and that if Entreri did desire a return to power in the guild, he would likely enlist LaValle.\n \"You have no reason not to trust me,\" LaValle said calmly. \"If Entreri wanted the guild back, I would tell you forthwith, that you might surrender leadership and still retain some high-ranking position.\"\n Quentin Bodeau\u0027s gray eyes flared dangerously. \"Surrender?\" he echoed.\n \"If I led a guild and heard that Artemis Entreri desired my position, I would surely do that!\" LaValle said with a laugh that somewhat dispelled the tension. \"But have no such fears. Entreri is back in Calimport, \u0027tis true, but he is no enemy to you.\"\n \"Who can tell?\" Bodeau replied, starting back down the corridor. LaValle fell into step beside him. \"But understand that you are to have no further contacts with the man.\"\n \"That hardly seems prudent. Are we not better off understanding his movements?\"\n \"No further contacts,\" Quentin Bodeau said more forcefully, grabbing LaValle by the shoulder and turning him so he could look directly into the wizard\u0027s eyes. \"None, and that is not my choice.\"\n \"You miss an opportunity, I fear,\" LaValle started to argue. \"Entreri is a friend, a very valuable-\"\n \"None!\" Quentin insisted, coming to an abrupt halt to accentuate his point. \"Believe me when I say that it would please me greatly to hire the assassin to take care of a few troublemakers among the sewer wererat guild. I have heard that Entreri particularly dislikes the distasteful creatures and that they hold little love for him.\"\n LaValle smiled at the memory. Pasha Pook had been heavily connected with a nasty wererat leader by the name of Rassiter. After Pook\u0027s fall, Rassiter had tried to enlist Entreri into a mutually beneficial alliance. Unfortunately for Rassiter, a very angry Entreri hadn\u0027t seen things quite that way.\n \"But we cannot enlist him,\" Quentin Bodeau went on. \"Nor are we ... are you, to have any further contact with him. These orders have come down to me from the Basadoni Guild, the Rakers\u0027 Guild, and Pasha Wroning himself.\"\n LaValle paused, caught off guard by the stunning news. Bodeau had just listed the three most powerful guilds of Calimport\u0027s streets.\n Quentin paused at the dining room door, knowing that there were attendants inside, wanting to get this settled privately with the wizard. \"They have declared Entreri an untouchable,\" he went on, meaning that no guildmaster, at the risk of street war, was to even speak with the man, let alone have any professional dealings with him.\n LaValle nodded, understanding but none too happy about the prospects. It made perfect sense, of course, as would any joint action the three rival guilds could agree upon. They had iced Entreri out of the system for fear that a minor guildmaster might empty his coffers and hire the assassin to kill one of the more prominent leaders. Those in the strongest positions of power preferred the status quo, and they all feared Entreri enough to recognize that he alone might upset that balance. What a testament to the man\u0027s reputation! And LaValle, above all others, understood it to be rightly given.\n \"I understand,\" he said to Quentin, bowing to show his obedience. \"Perhaps when the situation is better clarified we will find our opportunity to exploit my friendship with this very valuable man.\"\n Bodeau managed his first smile in several days, feeling assured by LaValle\u0027s seemingly sincere declarations. He was indeed far more at ease as they continued on their way to share an evening meal.\n But LaValle was not. He could hardly believe that the other guilds had moved so quickly to isolate Entreri. If that was the case, then he understood that they would be watching the assassin closely-close enough to learn of any attempts against Entreri and to bring about retaliation on any guild so foolish as to try to kill the man.\n LaValle ate quickly, then dismissed himself, explaining that he was in the middle of penning a particularly difficult scroll he hoped to finish that night.\n He went immediately to his crystal ball, hoping to locate Dog Perry, and was pleased indeed to learn that the fiery man and Chalsee Anguaine were both still within the guild house. He caught up to them on the street level in the main armory. He could guess easily enough why they might be in that particular room.\n \"You plan to go out this evening?\" the wizard calmly asked as he entered.\n \"We go out every evening,\" Dog Perry replied. \"It is our job, is it not?\"\n \"A few extra weapons?\" LaValle asked suspiciously, noting that both men had daggers strapped to every conceivable retrievable position.\n \"The guild lieutenant who is not careful is usually dead,\" Dog Perry replied dryly.\n \"Indeed,\" LaValle conceded with a bow. \"And, by word of the Basadoni, Wroning, and Rakers\u0027 guilds, the guild lieutenant who goes after Artemis Entreri is doing no favors for his master.\"\n The blunt declaration gave both men pause. Dog Perry worked through it quickly and calmly, getting back to his preparations with no discernible trace of guilt upon his blank expression. But Chalsee, less experienced by far, showed some clear signs of distress. LaValle knew he had hit the target directly. They were going after Entreri this very night.\n \"I would have thought you would consult with me first,\" the wizard remarked, \"to learn his whereabouts, of course, and perhaps see some of the defenses he obviously has set in place.\"\n \"You babble, wizard,\" Dog Perry insisted. \"I have many duties to attend and have no time for your foolishness.\" He slammed the door of the weapons locker as he finished, then walked right past LaValle. A nervous Chalsee Anguaine fell into step behind him, glancing back many times.\n LaValle considered the cold treatment and recognized that Dog Perry had indeed decided to go after Entreri and had also decided that LaValle could not be trusted as far as the dangerous assassin was concerned. Now the wizard, in considering all the possibilities, found his own dilemma. If Dog Perry succeeded in killing Entreri the dangerous young man who had just pointedly declared himself no friend of LaValle\u0027s would gain immensely in stature and power (if the other guilds did not decide to kill him for his rash actions). But if Entreri won, which LaValle deemed most likely, then he might not appreciate the fact that LaValle had not contacted him with any warning, as they had agreed.\n And yet LaValle could not dare to use his magics and contact Entreri. If the other guilds were watching the assassin, such forms of contact would be easily detected and traced.\n A very distressed LaValle went back to his room and sat for a long while in the darkness. In either scenario, whether Dog Perry or Entreri proved victorious, the guild might be in for more than a little trouble. Should he go to Quentin Bodeau? he wondered, but then he dismissed the thought, realizing that Quentin would do little more than pace the floor and chew his fingernails. Dog Perry was out in the streets now, and Quentin had no means to recall him.\n Should he gaze into his crystal ball and try to learn of the battle? Again, LaValle had to consider that any magical contact, even if it was no more than silent scrying, might be detected by the wizards hired by the more powerful guilds and might then implicate LaValle.\n So he sat in the darkness, wondering and worrying, as the hours slipped by. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-6.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
