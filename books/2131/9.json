{"id":94483,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Part 2 WALKING THE ROADS OF DANGER\\n\\n We each have our own path to tread. That seems such a simple and obvious thought, but in a world of relationships where so many people sublimate their own true feelings and desires in consideration of others, we take many steps off that true path.\\n\\n In the end, though, if we are to be truly happy, we must follow our hearts and find our way alone. I learned that truth when I walked out of Menzoberranzan and confirmed my path when I arrived in Icewind Dale and found these wonderful friends. After the last brutal fight in Mithral Hall, when half of Menzoberranzan, it seemed, marched to destroy the dwarves, I knew that my path lay elsewhere, that I needed to journey, to find a new horizon on which to set my gaze. Catti-brie knew it too, and because I understood that her desire to go along was not in sympathy to my desires but true to her own heart, I welcomed the company.\\n\\n We each have our own path to tread, and so I learned, painfully, that fateful morning in the mountains, that Wulfgar had found one that diverged from my own. How I wanted to stop him! How I wanted to plead with him or, if that failed, to beat him into unconsciousness and drag him back to the camp. When we parted, I felt a hole in my heart nearly as profound as that which I had felt when I first learned of his apparent death in the fight against the yochlol.\\n\\n And then, after I walked away, pangs of guilt layered above the pain of loss. Had I let Wulfgar go so easily because of his relationship with Catti-brie? Was there some place within me that saw my barbarian friend\u0027s return as a hindrance to a relationship that I had been building with the woman since we had ridden from Mithral Hall together?\\n\\n The guilt could find no true hold and was gone by the time I rejoined my companions. As I had my road to walk, and now Wulfgar his, so too would Catti-brie find hers. With me? With Wulfgar? Who could know? But whatever her road, I would not try to alter it in such a manner. I did not let Wulfgar go easily for any sense of personal gain. Not at all, for indeed my heart weighed heavy. No, I let Wulfgar go without much of an argument because I knew that there was nothing I, or our other friends, could do to heal the wounds within him. Nothing I could say to him could bring him solace, and if Catti-brie had begun to make any progress, then surely it had been destroyed in the flick of Wulfgar\u0027s fist slamming into her face.\\n\\n Partly it was fear that drove Wulfgar from us. He believed that he could not control the demons within him and that, in the grasp of those painful recollections, he might truly hurt one of us. Mostly, though, Wulfgar left us because of shame. How could he face Bruenor again after striking Catti-brie? How could he face Catti-brie? What words might he say in apology when in truth, and he knew it, it very well might happen again? And beyond that one act, Wulfgar perceived himself as weak because the images of Errtu\u0027s legacy were so overwhelming him. Logically, they were but memories and nothing tangible to attack the strong man. To Wulfgar\u0027s pragmatic view of the world, being defeated by mere memories equated to great weakness. In his culture, being defeated in battle is no cause for shame, but running from battle is the highest dishonor.\\n\\n Along that same line of reasoning, being unable to defeat a great monster is acceptable, but being defeated by an intangible thing such as a memory equates with cowardice.\\n\\n He will learn better, I believe. He will come to understand the he should feel no shame for his inability to cope with the persistent horrors and temptations of Errtu and the Abyss. And then, when he relieves himself from the burden of shame, he will find a way to truly overcome those horrors and dismiss his guilt over the temptations. Only then will he return to Icewind Dale, to those who love him and who will welcome him back eagerly.\\n\\n Only then.\\n\\n That is my hope, not my expectation. Wulfgar ran off into the wilds, into the Spine of the World, where yetis and giants and goblin tribes make their homes, where wolves will take their food as they find it, whether hunting a deer or a man. I do not honestly know if he means to come out of the mountains back to the tundra he knows well, or to the more civilized southland, or if he will wander the high and dangerous trails, daring death in an attempt to restore some of the courage he believes he has lost. Or perhaps he will tempt death too greatly, so that it will finally win out and put an end to his pain.\\n\\n That is my fear.\\n\\n I do not know. We each have our own roads to tread, and Wulfgar has found his, and it is a path, I understand, that is not wide enough for a companion.\\n\\n Chapter 8 INADVERTENT SIGNALS\\n\\n They moved somberly, for the thrill of adventure and the joy of being reunited and on the road again had been stolen by Wulfgar\u0027s departure. When he returned to camp and explained the barbarian\u0027s absence, Drizzt had been truly surprised by the reactions of his companions. At first, predictably, Catti-brie and Regis had screamed that they must go and find the man, while Bruenor just grumbled about \"stupid humans.\" Both the halfling and the woman had calmed quickly, though, and it turned out to be Catti-brie\u0027s voice above all the others proclaiming that Wulfgar needed to choose his own course. She was not bitter about the attack and to her credit showed no anger toward the barbarian at all.\\n\\n But she knew. Like Drizzt, she understood that the inner demons tormenting Wulfgar could not be excised with comforting words from friends, or even through the fury of battle. She had tried and had thought that she was making some progress, but in the end it had become painfully apparent to her that she could do nothing to help the man, that Wulfgar had to help himself.\\n\\n And so they went on, the four friends and Guenhwyvar, keeping their word to guide Camlaine\u0027s wagon out of the dale and along the south road.\\n\\n That night, Drizzt found Catti-brie on the eastern edge of the encampment, staring out into the blackness, and it was not hard for the drow to figure out what she was hoping to spot.\\n\\n \"He will not return to us any time soon,\" Drizzt remarked quietly, moving to the woman\u0027s side.\\n\\n Catti-brie glanced at him only briefly, then turned her eyes back to the dark silhouettes of the mountains.\\n\\n There was nothing to see.\\n\\n \"He chose wrong,\" the woman said softly after several long and silent moments had slipped past. \"I\u0027m knowin\u0027 that he has to help himself, but he could\u0027ve done that among his friends, not out in the wilds,\"\\n\\n \"He did not want us to witness his most personal battles,\" Drizzt explained.\\n\\n \"Ever was pride Wulfgar\u0027s greatest failing,\" Catti-brie quickly replied.\\n\\n \"That is the way of his people, the way of his father, and his father\u0027s father before him,\" the ranger said. \"The tundra barbarians do not accept weakness in others or in themselves, and Wulfgar believes that his inability to defeat mere memories is naught more than weakness.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie shook her head. She didn\u0027t have to speak the words aloud, for both she and Drizzt understood that the man was purely wrong in that belief, that, many times, the most powerful foes are those within.\\n\\n Drizzt reached up then and brushed a finger gently along the side of Catti-brie\u0027s nose, the area that had swelled badly from Wulfgar\u0027s punch. Catti-brie winced at first, but it was only because she had not expected the touch, and not from any real pain.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not so bad,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Bruenor might not agree with you,\" the drow replied.\\n\\n That brought a smile to Catti-brie\u0027s face, for indeed, if Drizzt had brought Wulfgar back soon after the assault, it would have taken all of them to pull the vicious dwarf off the man. But even that had changed now, they both knew. Wulfgar had been as a son to Bruenor for many years, and the dwarf had been purely devastated, more so than any of the others, after the man\u0027s apparent death. Now, in the realization that Wulfgar\u0027s troubles had taken him from them again, Bruenor sorely missed the man, and surely would forgive him his strike against Catti-brie ... as long as the barbarian was properly contrite. They all would have forgiven Wulfgar, completely and without judgment, and would have helped him in any way they could to overcome his emotional obstacles. That was the tragedy of it all, for they had no help to offer that would be of any real value.\\n\\n Drizzt and Catti-brie sat together long into the night, staring at the empty tundra, the woman resting her head on the strong shoulder of the drow.\\n\\n The next two days and nights on the road proved peacefully uneventful, except that Drizzt more than once spotted the tracks of Regis\u0027s giant friend, apparently shadowing their movements. Still, the behemoth made no approach near the camp, so the drow did not become overly concerned. By the middle of the third day after Wulfgar\u0027s departure, they came in sight of the city of Luskan.\\n\\n \"Your destination, Camlaine,\" the drow noted when the driver called out that he could see the distinctive skyline of Luskan, including the treelike structure that marked the city\u0027s wizard guild. \"It has been our pleasure to travel with you.\"\\n\\n \"And eat your fine food!\" Regis added happily, drawing a laugh from everyone.\\n\\n \"Perhaps if you are still in the southland when we return, and intent on heading back to the dale, we will accompany you again,\" Drizzt finished.\\n\\n \"And glad we will all be for the company,\" the merchant replied, warmly clasping the drow\u0027s hand. \"Farewell, wherever your road may take you, though I offer the parting as a courtesy only, for I do not doubt that you shall fare well indeed! Let the monsters take note of your passing and hide their heads low.\"\\n\\n The wagon rolled away, down the fairly smooth road to Luskan. The four friends watched it for a long time. \"We could go in with him,\" Regis offered. \"You are known well enough down there, I would guess,\" he added to the drow. \"Your heritage should not bring us any problems...\"\\n\\n Drizzt shook his head before the halfling even finished the thought. \"I can indeed walk freely through Luskan,\" he said, \"but my course, our course, is to the southeast. A long, long road lies ahead of us.\" \"But in Luskan-\" Regis started. \"Rumblebelly\u0027s thinkin\u0027 that me boy might be in there,\" Bruenor bluntly cut in. From the dwarfs tone it seemed that he, too, considered following the merchant wagon.\\n\\n \"He might indeed,\" Drizzt said. \"And I hope that he is, for Luskan is not nearly as dangerous as the wilds of the Spine of the World.\"\\n\\n Bruenor and Regis looked at him curiously, for if he agreed with their reasoning, why weren\u0027t they following the merchant?\\n\\n \"If Wulfgar\u0027s in Luskan, then better by far that we\u0027re turning away now,\" Catti-brie answered for Drizzt. \"We\u0027re not wanting to find him now.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027re ye sayin\u0027?\" the flustered dwarf demanded.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar walked away from us,\" Drizzt reminded. \"Of his own accord. Do you believe that three days\u0027 time has changed anything?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not for knowin\u0027 unless we ask,\" said Bruenor, but his tone was less argumentative, and the brutal truth of the situation began to sink in. Of course Bruenor, and all of them, wanted to find Wulfgar and wanted the man to recant his decision to leave. But of course that would not happen.\\n\\n \"If we find him now, we\u0027ll only push him further from us,\" Catti-brie said.\\n\\n \"He will grow angry at first because he will see us as meddling,\" Drizzt agreed. \"And then, when his anger at last fades, if it ever does, he will be even more ashamed of his actions.\"\\n\\n Bruenor snorted and threw his hands up in defeat.\\n\\n They all took a last look at Luskan, hoping that Wulfgar was there, then they walked past the place. They headed southeast, flanking the city, then down the southern road with a week\u0027s travel before them to the city of Waterdeep. There they hoped to ride with a merchant ship to the south, to Baldur\u0027s Gate, and then up river to the city of Iriaebor. There they would take to the open road again, across several hundred miles of the Shining Plains to Caradoon and the Spirit Soaring. Regis had planned the journey, using maps and merchant sources back in Bryn Shander. The halfling had chosen Waterdeep as their best departure point over the closer Luskan because ships left Waterdeep\u0027s great harbor every day, with many traveling to Baldur\u0027s Gate. In truth, he wasn\u0027t sure, nor were any of the others, if this was the best course or not. The maps available in Icewind Dale were far from complete, and far from current. Drizzt and Catti-brie, the only two of the group to have traveled to the Spirit Soaring, had done so magically, with no understanding of the lay of the land.\\n\\n Still, despite the careful planning the halfling had done, each of them began doubting their ambitious travel plans throughout that day as they passed the city. Those plans had been formed out of a love for the road and adventure, a desire to take in the sights of their grand world, and a supreme confidence in their abilities to get through. Now, though, with Wulfgar\u0027s departure, that love and confidence had been severely shaken. Perhaps they would be better off going into Luskan to the notable wizards\u0027 guild and hiring a mage to magically contact Cadderly so that the powerful cleric might wind walk to them and finish this business quickly Or perhaps the Lords of Waterdeep, renowned throughout the lands for their dedication to justice and their power to carry it out, would take the crystal artifact off the companions\u0027 hands and, as Cadderly had vowed, find the means to destroy it.\\n\\n If any of the four had spoken aloud their mounting doubts about the journey that morning, the trip might have been abandoned. But because of their confusion over Wulfgar\u0027s departure, and because none of them wanted to admit that they could not focus on another mission while their dear friend was in danger, they held their tongues, sharing thoughts but not words. By the time the sun disappeared into the vast waters to the west, the city of Luskan and the hopes of finding Wulfgar were long out of sight.\\n\\n Regis\u0027s giant friend, though, continued to shadow their movements. Even as Bruenor, Catti-brie, and the halfling prepared the camp, Drizzt and Guenhwyvar came upon the huge tracks, leading down to a copse of trees less than three hundred yards from the bluff they had chosen as a sight. Now the giant\u0027s movements could no longer be dismissed as coincidence, for they had left the Spine of the World far behind, and few giants ever wandered into this civilized region where townsfolk would form militias and hunt them down whenever they were spotted.\\n\\n By the time Drizzt got back to camp, the halfling was fast asleep, several empty plates scattered about his bedroll. \"It is time we confront our large shadow,\" the ranger explained to the other two as he moved over and gave Regis a good shake.\\n\\n \"So ye\u0027re meanin\u0027 to let us in on yer battle plans this time,\" Bruenor replied sarcastically.\\n\\n \"I hope there will be no battle,\" the drow answered. \"To our knowledge, this particular giant has posed no threat to wagons rolling along the road in Icewind Dale, and so I find no reason to fight the creature. Better that we convince it to go back to its home without drawing sword.\"\\n\\n A sleepy-eyed Regis sat up and glanced around, then rolled back down under his covers-almost, for quick-handed Drizzt caught him halfway back to the comfort zone and roughly pulled him to his feet.\\n\\n \"Not my watch!\" the halfling complained.\\n\\n \"You brought the giant to us, and so you shall convince him to leave,\" the drow replied.\\n\\n \"The giant?\" Regis asked, still not catching on to the meaning of it all.\\n\\n \"Yer big friend,\" Bruenor explained. \"He\u0027s followin\u0027 us, and we\u0027re thinking it\u0027s past time he goes home. Now, ye come along with yer tricky gem and make him leave, or we\u0027ll cut him down where he stands.\"\\n\\n Regis\u0027s expression showed that he didn\u0027t much like that prospect. The giant had served him well in the fight, and he had to admit a certain fondness for the big brute. He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear the cobwebs, then patted his full belly and retrieved his shoes. Even though he was moving as fast as he ever moved, the others were already out of the encampment by the time he was ready to follow.\\n\\n Drizzt was first into the copse, with Guenhwyvar flanking him. The drow stayed along the ground, picking a clear route away from dried leaves and snapping twigs, silent as a shadow, while Guenhwyvar sometimes padded along the ground and sometimes took to the secure low branches of thick trees. The giant was making no real effort to conceal itself and even had a fairly large fire going. The light guided the two companions and then the other three trailing them.\\n\\n Still a dozen yards away, Drizzt heard the rhythmic snoring, but then, barely two steps later he heard a loud rustle as the giant apparently woke up and jumped to his feet. Drizzt froze in place and scanned the area, seeking any scouts who might have alerted the behemoth, but there was nothing, no evident creatures and no noise at all save the continuous gentle hissing of the wind through the new leaves.\\n\\n Convinced that the giant was alone, the drow moved on, coming to a clearing. The fire and the behemoth, and it was indeed Junger, were plainly visible across the way. Out stepped Drizzt, and the giant hardly seemed surprised.\\n\\n \"Strange that we should meet again,\" the drow remarked, resting his forearms comfortably across the hilts of his sheathed weapons and assuming an un-threatening posture. \"I had thought you returned to your mountain home.\"\\n\\n \"It bade me otherwise,\" Junger said, and again the drow was taken aback by the giant\u0027s command of language and sophisticated dialect.\\n\\n \"It?\" the drow asked.\\n\\n \"Some calls cannot be unanswered, you understand,\" the giant replied.\\n\\n \"Regis,\" Drizzt called back over his shoulder, and he heard the commotion as his three friends, all of them quiet by the standards of their respective races but clamorous indeed by the standards of the dark elf, moved through the forest behind him. Hardly turning his head, for he did not want to further alert the giant, Drizzt did take note of Guenhwyvar, padding quietly along a branch to the behemoth\u0027s left flank. She stopped within easy springing distance of the giant\u0027s head. \"The halfling will bring it,\" Drizzt explained. \"Perhaps then the call will be better understood and abated.\"\\n\\n The giant\u0027s big face screwed up with confusion. \"The halfling?\" he echoed skeptically.\\n\\n Bruenor crashed through the brush to stand beside the drow, then Catti-brie behind him, her deadly bow in hand, and finally, Regis, coming out complaining about a scratch one branch had just inflicted on his cherubic face.\\n\\n \"It bade Junger to follow us,\" the drow explained, indicating the ruby pendant. \"Show him a better course.\"\\n\\n Smiling ear to ear, Regis stepped forward and pulled out the chain and ruby pendant, starting the mesmerizing gem on a gentle swing.\\n\\n \"Get back, little rodent,\" the giant boomed, averting his eyes from the halfling. \"I\u0027ll tolerate none of your tricks this time!\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s calling to you,\" Regis protested, holding the gem out even further and flicking it with a finger of his free hand to set it spinning, its many facets catching the firelight in a dazzling display.\\n\\n \"So it is,\" the giant replied. \"Thus my business is not with you.\"\\n\\n \"But I hold the gem.\"\\n\\n \"Gem?\" the giant echoed. \"What do I care for any such meager treasures when measured against the promises of Crenshinibon?\"\\n\\n That proclamation widened the eyes of the companions, except for Regis, who was so entranced by his own gemtwirling that the behemoth\u0027s words didn\u0027t even register with him. \"Oh, but just look at how it spins!\" he said happily. \"It calls to you, its dearest friend, and bids you-\" Regis ended with a squeaky \"Hey!\" as Bruenor rushed up and yanked him backward so forcefully that it took him right off the ground. He landed beside Drizzt and skittered backward in a futile attempt to hold his balance, but tripped anyway, tumbling hard into the brush.\\n\\n Junger came forward in a rush, reaching as if to slap the dwarf aside, but a silver-streaking arrow sizzled past his head, and the giant jolted upright, startled.\\n\\n \"The next one takes yer face,\" Catti-brie promised.\\n\\n Bruenor eased back to join the woman and the drow.\\n\\n \"You have foolishly followed an errant call,\" Drizzt said calmly, trying very hard to keep the situation under control. The ranger held no love for giants, to be sure, but he almost felt sympathy for this poor misguided fool. \"Crenshinibon? What is Crenshinibon?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you know well,\" the giant replied. \"You above all others, dark elf. You are the possessor, but Crenshinibon rejects you and has selected me as your successor.\"\\n\\n \"All that I truly know about you is your name, giant,\" the drow gently replied. \"Ever has your kind been at war with the smaller folk of the world, and yet I offer you this one chance to turn back for the Spine of the World, back to your home.\"\\n\\n \"And so I shall,\" the giant replied with a chuckle, crossing his ankles calmly and leaning on a tree for support. \"As soon as I have Crenshinibon.\" The cunning behemoth exploded into motion, tearing a thick limb from the tree and launching it at the friends, mostly to force Catti-brie and that nasty bow to dive aside.\\n\\n Junger strode forward and was stunned to find the drow already in swift motion, scimitars drawn, rushing between his legs and slicing away.\\n\\n Even as the giant turned to catch Drizzt as he rushed out behind him, Bruenor came in hard. The dwarf\u0027s axe chopped for the tendon at the back of the behemoth\u0027s ankle, and then, suddenly, six hundred pounds of panther crashed against the turning giant\u0027s shoulder and head, knocking him off-balance. He would have held his footing, except that Catti-brie drove an arrow into his lower back. Howling and spinning, Junger went down. Drizzt, Bruenor and Guenhwyvar all skittered out of harm\u0027s way.\\n\\n \"Go home!\" Drizzt called to the brute as he struggled to his hands and knees.\\n\\n With a defiant roar, the giant dived out at the drow, arms outstretched. He pulled his arms in fast, both hands suddenly bleeding from deep scimitar gashes, and then he jerked in pain as Catti-brie\u0027s next arrow drove into his hip.\\n\\n Drizzt started to call out again, wanting to reason with the brute, but Bruenor had heard enough. The dwarf rushed up the prone giant\u0027s back, quick-stepping to hold his balance as the creature tried to roll him off. The dwarf leaped over the giant\u0027s turning shoulder, coming down squarely atop his collarbone. Bruenor\u0027s axe came down fast, quicker to the strike than the giant\u0027s reaching hands. The axe cut deep into Junger\u0027s face.\\n\\n Huge hands clamped around Bruenor, but they had little strength left. Guenhwyvar leaped in and caught one of the giant\u0027s arms, bringing it down under her weight, pinning the hand with claws and teeth. Catti-brie blew the other arm from the dwarf with a perfectly aimed shot.\\n\\n Bruenor held his ground, leaning down on the embedded axe, and at last, the giant lay still.\\n\\n Regis came out of the brush and gave a kick at the branch the giant had thrown their way. \"Worms in an apple!\" he complained. \"Why\u0027d you kill him?\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re seein\u0027 a choice?\" Bruenor called back incredulously, then he braced himself and tugged his axe from the split head. \"I\u0027m not for talking to five thousand pounds of enemy.\"\\n\\n \"I take no pleasure in that kill,\" Drizzt admitted. He wiped his blades on the fallen behemoth\u0027s tunic, then slid them into their sheaths. \"Better for all of us that the giant simply went home.\"\\n\\n \"And I could have convinced him to do so,\" Regis argued.\\n\\n \"No,\" the drow answered. \u0027Tour pendant is powerful, I do not doubt, but it has no strength over one entranced by Crenshinibon.\" As he spoke, he opened his belt pouch and produced the artifact, the famed crystal shard.\\n\\n \"Ye hold it out, and its call\u0027ll be all the louder,\" Bruenor said grimly. \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 we might be finding a long road ahead of us.\"\\n\\n \"Let it bring the monsters in,\" Catti-brie said. \"It\u0027ll make our task in killing them all the easier.\"\\n\\n The coldness of her tone caught them all by surprise, but only for the moment it took them to look back at her and see the bruise on her face and remember the cause of her bad mood.\\n\\n \"Ye notice that the damned thing\u0027s not working on any of us,\" the woman reasoned. \"So it seems that any falling under its spell are deservin\u0027 what they\u0027ll find at our hands.\"\\n\\n \"It does appear that Crenshinibon\u0027s power to corrupt extends only to those already of an evil weal,\" Drizzt agreed.\\n\\n \"And so our road\u0027ll be a bit more exciting,\" Catti-brie said. She didn\u0027t bother to add that in this light, she wished Wulfgar was with them. She knew the others were no doubt thinking the exact same thing.\\n\\n They searched the giant\u0027s camp, then turned back to their own fire. Given the new realization that the crystal shard might be working against them, might be reaching out to any nearby monsters in an attempt to get free of the friends, they decided to double their watches from that point forward, two asleep and two awake.\\n\\n Regis was not pleased.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-9.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
