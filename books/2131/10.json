{"id":94484,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"From the shadows he watched the wizard walk slowly through the door. Other voices followed LaValle in from the corridor, but the wizard hardly acknowledged them, just shut the door and moved to his private stock liquor cabinet at the side of the audience room, lighting only a single candle atop it.\\n\\n Entreri clenched his hands eagerly, torn as to whether he should confront the wizard verbally or merely kill the man for not informing him of Dog Perry\u0027s attack.\\n\\n Cup in one hand, burning taper in the other, LaValle moved from the cabinet to a larger standing candelabra. The room brightened with each touch as another candle flared to life. Behind the occupied wizard, Entreri stepped into the open.\\n\\n His warrior senses put him on his guard immediately. Something-but what?-at the very edges of his consciousness alerted him. Perhaps it had to do with LaValle\u0027s comfortable demeanor or some barely perceptible extraneous noise.\\n\\n LaValle turned around then and jumped back just a bit upon seeing Entreri standing in the middle of the room. Again the assassin\u0027s perceptions nagged at him. The wizard didn\u0027t seem frightened or surprised enough.\\n\\n \"Did you believe that Dog Perry would defeat me?\" Entreri asked sarcastically.\\n\\n \"Dog Perry?\" LaValle came back. \"I have not seen the man-\"\\n\\n \"Do not lie to me,\" Entreri calmly interrupted. \"I have known you too long, LaValle, to believe such ignorance of you. You watched Dog Perry, without doubt, as you know all the movements of all the players.\"\\n\\n \"Not all, obviously,\" the wizard replied dryly, indicating the uninvited man.\\n\\n Entreri wasn\u0027t so sure of that last claim, but he let it pass. \"You agreed to warn me when Dog Perry came after me,\" he said loudly. If the wizard had guild bodyguards nearby, let them hear of his duplicity. \"Yet there he was, dagger in hand, with no prior warning from my friend LaValle.\"\\n\\n LaValle gave a great sigh and moved to the side, slumping into a chair. \"I did indeed know,\" he admitted. \"But I could not act upon that knowledge,\" he added quickly, for the assassin\u0027s eyes narrowed dangerously. \"You must understand. All contact with you is forbidden.\"\\n\\n \"Kelp-enwalled,\" Entreri remarked.\\n\\n LaValle held his hands out helplessly.\\n\\n \"I also know that LaValle rarely adheres to such orders,\" Entreri went on.\\n\\n \"This one was different,\" came another voice. A slender man, well dressed and coifed, entered the room from the wizard\u0027s study.\\n\\n Entreri\u0027s muscles tensed; he had just checked out that room, along with the other two in the wizard\u0027s suite, and no one had been in there. Now he knew beyond doubt that he had been expected.\\n\\n \"My guildmaster,\" LaValle explained. \"Quentin Bodeau.\"\\n\\n Entreri didn\u0027t blink; he had already guessed that much.\\n\\n \"This kelp-enwalling order came not from any particular guild, but from the three most prominent,\" Quentin Bodeau clarified. \"To go against it would have meant eradication.\"\\n\\n \"Any magical attempt I might have made would have been detected,\" LaValle tried to explain. He gave a chuckle, trying to break the tension. \"I did not believe it would matter, in any case,\" he said. \"I knew that Dog Perry would prove no real test for you.\"\\n\\n \"If that is so, then why was he allowed to come after me?\" Entreri asked, aiming the question at Bodeau.\\n\\n The guildmaster only shrugged and said, \"Rarely have I been able to control all the movements of that one.\"\\n\\n \"Let that bother you no more,\" Entreri replied grimly.\\n\\n Bodeau managed a weak smile. \"You must appreciate our position ...\" he started to say.\\n\\n \"I am to believe the word of the man who ordered me murdered?\" Entreri asked incredulously.\\n\\n \"I did not-\" Bodeau began to argue before being cut off by yet another voice from the wizard\u0027s study, a woman\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"If we believed that Quentin Bodeau, or any other ranking member of his guild knew of and approved of the attack, this guild house would be empty of living people.\"\\n\\n A tall, dark-haired woman came through the door, flanked by a muscular warrior with a curving black mustache and a more slender man, if it was a man, for Entreri could hardly make out any features under the cowl of the dark cloak. A pair of armored guards strode in behind the trio, and though the last one through the door shut it behind him, Entreri understood that there was likely another one about, probably another wizard. There was no way such a group could have been concealed in the other room, even from his casual glance, without magical aid. Besides, he knew, this group was too comfortable. Even if they were all skilled with weapons, they could not be confident that they alone could bring Entreri down.\\n\\n \"I am Sharlotta Vespers,\" the woman said, her icy eyes flashing. \"I give you Kadran Gordeon and Hand, my fellow lieutenants in the guild of Pasha Basadoni. Yes, he lives still and is glad to see you well.\"\\n\\n Entreri knew that to be a lie. If Basadoni were alive the guild would have contacted him much earlier, and in a less dangerous situation.\\n\\n \"Are you affiliated?\" Sharlotta asked.\\n\\n \"I was not when I left Calimport, and I only recently came back to the city,\" the assassin answered.\\n\\n \"Now you are affiliated,\" Sharlotta purred, and Entreri understood that he was in no position to deny her claim.\\n\\n So he would not be killed-not now, at least. He would not have to spend his nights looking over his shoulder for would be assassins nor deal with the impertinent advances of fools like Dog Perry. The Basadoni Guild had claimed him as their own, and though he would be able to go and take jobs wherever he decided, as long as they did not involve the murder of anyone connected with Pasha Basadoni, his primary contacts would be Kadran Gordeon, whom he did not trust, and Hand.\\n\\n He should have been pleased at the turn of events, he knew, sitting quietly on the roof of the Copper Ante late that night. He couldn\u0027t have expected a better course.\\n\\n And yet, for some reason that he could hardly fathom, Entreri was not pleased in the least. He had his old life back, if he wanted it. With his skills, he knew he could soon return to the glories he had once known. And yet he now understood the limitations of those glories and knew that while he could easily re-ascend to the highest level of assassin in Calimport, that level would hardly be enough to satisfy the emptiness he felt within.\\n\\n He simply did not wish to go back to his old ways of murder for money. It was no bout of conscience-nothing like that!-but no thought of that former life sparked any excitement within the man.\\n\\n Ever the pragmatist, Entreri decided to play it one hour at a time. He went over the side of the roof, silent and sure-footed, picking his way down to the street, then entered through the front door.\\n\\n All eyes focused on him, but he hardly cared as he made his way across the common room to the door at the back. One halfling approached him there, as if to stop him, but a glare from Entreri backed the little one off, and the assassin pushed through.\\n\\n Again the sight of the enormously fat Dondon assaulted him profoundly.\\n\\n \"Artemis!\" Dondon said happily, though Entreri did note a bit of tension creeping into the halfling\u0027s voice, a common reaction whenever the assassin arrived unannounced at anyone\u0027s doorstep. \"Come in, my friend. Sit and eat. Partake of good company.\"\\n\\n Entreri looked at the heaps of half-eaten sweets and at the two painted female halflings flanking the bloated wretch. He did sit down a safe distance away, though he moved none of the many platters in front of him narrowing his eyes as one of the female halflings tried to approach.\\n\\n \"You must learn to relax and enjoy those fruits your work has provided,\" Dondon said. \"You are back with Basadoni, so \u0027tis said, and so you are free.\"\\n\\n Entreri noted that the irony of that statement was apparently lost on the halfling.\\n\\n \"What good is all of your difficult and dangerous work if you cannot learn to relax and enjoy those pleasures your labors might buy for you?\" Dondon asked.\\n\\n \"How did it happen?\" Entreri asked bluntly.\\n\\n Dondon stared at him, obvious confusion splayed on his sagging face.\\n\\n In explanation, Entreri looked all around, motioning to the plates, to the whores, and to Dondon\u0027s massive belly.\\n\\n Dondon\u0027s expression soured. \"You know why I am in here,\" he remarked quietly, all the bounce having left his tone.\\n\\n \"I know why you came in here ... to hide . . . and I agree with that decision,\" Entreri replied. \"But why?\" Again he let the halfling follow his gaze to all the excess, plate by plate, whore by whore. \"Why this?\"\\n\\n \"I choose to enjoy . . .\" Dondon started, but Entreri would hear none of that.\\n\\n \"If I could offer you back your old life, would you take it?\" the assassin asked.\\n\\n Dondon stared at him blankly.\\n\\n \"If I could change the word on the street so that Dondon could walk free of the Copper Ante, would Dondon be pleased?\" Entreri pressed. \"Or is Dondon pleased with the excuse?\"\\n\\n \"You speak in riddles.\"\\n\\n \"I speak the truth,\" Entreri shot back, trying to look the halfling in the eye, though the sight of those drooping, sleepy lids surely revolted him. He could hardly believe his own level of anger in looking at Dondon. A part of him wanted to draw out his dagger and cut the wretch\u0027s heart out.\\n\\n But Artemis Entreri did not kill for passion, and he held that part in check.\\n\\n \"Would you go back?\" he asked slowly, emphasizing every word.\\n\\n Dondon didn\u0027t reply, didn\u0027t blink, but in the nonresponse, Entreri had his answer, the one he had feared the most.\\n\\n The room\u0027s door swung open, and Dwahvel entered. \"Is there a problem in here, Master Entreri?\" she asked sweetly.\\n\\n Entreri climbed to his feet and moved for the open door. \"None for me,\" he replied, moving past.\\n\\n Dwahvel caught him by the arm-a dangerous move indeed! Fortunately for her, Entreri was too absorbed in his contemplation of Dondon to take affront.\\n\\n \"About our deal,\" the female halfling remarked. \"I may have need of your services.\"\\n\\n Entreri spent a long while considering those words, wondering why, for some reason, they so assaulted him. He had enough to think about already without having Dwahvel pressing her ridiculous needs upon him. \"And what did you give to me in exchange for these services you so desire?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Information,\" the halfling replied. \"As we agreed.\" \"You told me of the kelp-enwalling, hardly something I could not have discerned on my own,\" Entreri replied. \"Other than that, Dwahvel was of little use to me, and that measure I surely can repay.\"\\n\\n The halfling\u0027s mouth opened as if she meant to protest, but Entreri just turned away and walked across the common room.\\n\\n \"You may find my doors closed to you,\" Dwahvel called after him.\\n\\n In truth, Entreri hardly cared, for he didn\u0027t expect that he would desire to see wretched Dondon again. Still, more for effect than any practical gain, he did turn back to let his dangerous gaze settle over the halfling. \"That would not be wise,\" was all he offered before sweeping out of the room and back onto the dark street, then back to the solitude of the rooftops.\\n\\n Up there, after many minutes of concentration, he came to understand why he so hated Dondon. Because he saw himself. No, he would never allow himself to become so bloated, for gluttony had never been one of his weaknesses, but what he saw was a creature beaten by the weight of life itself, a creature that had surrendered to despair. In Dondon\u0027s case it had been simple fear that had defeated him, that had locked him in a room and buried him in lust and gluttony.\\n\\n In Entreri\u0027s case, would it be simple apathy?\\n\\n He stayed on the roof all the night, but he did not find his answers.\\n\\n The knock came in the correct sequence, two raps, then three, then two again, so he knew even as he dragged himself out of his bed that it was the Basadoni Guild come calling. Normally Entreri would have taken precautions anyway-normally he would not have slept through half the day-but he did nothing now, didn\u0027t even retrieve his dagger. He just went to the door and, without even asking, pulled it open.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t recognize the man standing there, a young and nervous fellow with woolly black hair cut tight to his head, and dark, darting eyes.\\n\\n \"From Kadran Gordeon,\" the man explained, handing Entreri a rolled parchment.\\n\\n \"Hold!\" Entreri said as the nervous young man turned and started away. The man\u0027s head spun back to regard the assassin, and Entreri noted one hand slipping under the folds of his light-colored robes, reaching for a weapon no doubt.\\n\\n \"Where is Gordeon?\" Entreri asked. \"And why did he not deliver this to me personally?\"\\n\\n \"Please, good sir,\" the young man said in his thick Calimshite accent, bowing repeatedly. \"I was only told to give that to you.\"\\n\\n \"By Kadran Gordeon?\" Entreri asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" the man said, nodding wildly.\\n\\n Entreri shut his door, then heard the running footsteps of the relieved man outside retreating down the hall and then the stairs at full speed.\\n\\n He stood there, considering the parchment and the delivery. Gordeon hadn\u0027t even come to him personally, and he understood why. To do so would have been too much an open show of respect. The lieutenants of the guild feared him-not that he would kill them, but more that he would ascend to a rank above them. Now, by using this inconsequential messenger, Gordeon was trying to show Entreri the true pecking order, one that had him just above the bottom rung.\\n\\n With a resigned shake of his head, a helpless acceptance of the stupidity of it all, the assassin pulled the tie from the parchment and unrolled it. The orders were simple enough, giving a man\u0027s name and last known address, with instructions that he should be killed as soon as it could be arranged. That very night, if possible, the next day at the latest.\\n\\n At the bottom was a last notation that the targeted man had no known guild affiliation, nor was he in particularly good standing with city or merchant guardsmen, nor did he have any known powerful friends or relatives.\\n\\n Entreri considered that bit of news carefully. Either he was being set up against a very dangerous opponent, or, more likely, Gordeon had given him this pitifully easy hit to demean him, to lessen his credentials. In his former days in Calimport, Entreri\u0027s talents had been reserved for the killing of guildmasters or wizards, noblemen, and captains of the guard. Of course, if Gordeon and the other two lieutenants gave him any such difficult tasks and he proved successful, his standing would grow among the community and they would fear his quick ascension through the ranks.\\n\\n No matter, he decided.\\n\\n He took one last look at the listed address-a region of Calimport that he knew well-and went to retrieve his tools.\\n\\n He heard the children crying nearby, for the hovel had only two rooms, and those separated by only a thick drapery. A very homely young woman-Entreri noted as he spied on her from around the edge of the drapery-tended to the children. She begged them to settle down and be quiet, threatening that their father would soon be home.\\n\\n She came out of the back room a moment later, oblivious to the assassin as he crouched behind another curtain under a side window. Entreri cut a small hole in the drape and watched her movements as she went about her work. Everything was brisk and efficient; she was on edge, he knew.\\n\\n The door, yet another drape, pushed aside and a young, skinny man entered, his face appearing haggard, eyes sunken back in his skull, several days of beard on his chin and cheeks.\\n\\n \"Did you find it?\" the woman asked sharply.\\n\\n The man shook his head, and it seemed to Entreri that his eyes drooped just a bit more.\\n\\n \"I begged you not to work with them!\" the woman scolded. \"I knew that no good-\"\\n\\n She stopped short as his eyes widened in horror. He saw, looking over her shoulder, the assassin emerging from behind the draperies. He turned as if to flee, but the woman looked back and cried out.\\n\\n The man froze in place; he would not leave her.\\n\\n Entreri watched it all calmly. Had the man continued his retreat, the assassin would have cut him down with a dagger throw before he ever got outside.\\n\\n \"Not my family,\" the man begged, turning back and walking toward Entreri, his hands out wide, palms open. \"And not here.\"\\n\\n \"You know why I have come?\" the assassin asked.\\n\\n The woman began to cry, muttering for mercy, but her husband grabbed her gently but firmly and pulled her back, angling her for the children\u0027s room, then pushing her along.\\n\\n \"It was not my fault,\" the man said quietly when she was gone. \"I begged Kadran Gordeon. I told him that I would somehow find the money.\"\\n\\n The old Artemis Entreri would not have been intrigued at that point. The old Artemis Entreri would never even have listened to the words. The old Artemis Entreri would have just finished the task and walked out. But now he found that he was interested, mildly, and, as he had no other pressing business, he was in no hurry to finish.\\n\\n \"I will cause no trouble for you if you promise that you will not hurt my family,\" the man said.\\n\\n \"You believe that you could me cause trouble?\" Entreri asked.\\n\\n The helpless, pitiful man shook his head. \"Please,\" he begged. \"I only wished to show them a better life. I agreed to, even welcomed, the job of moving money from Docker\u0027s Street to the drop only because in those easy tasks I earned more than a month of labor can bring me in honest work.\"\\n\\n Entreri had heard it all before, of course. So many times, fools-camels, they were called-joined into a guild, performing delivery tasks for what seemed to the simple peasants huge amounts of money. The guilds only hired the camels so that rival guilds would not know who was transporting the money. Eventually, though, the other guilds would figure out the routes and the camels, and would steal the shipment. Then the poor camels, if they survived the ambush, would be quickly eliminated by the guild that had hired them.\\n\\n \"You understood the danger of the company you kept,\" Entreri remarked.\\n\\n The man nodded. \"Only a few deliveries,\" he replied. \"Only a few, and then I would quit.\"\\n\\n Entreri laughed and shook his head, considering the fool\u0027s absurd plan. One could not \"quit\" as a camel. Anyone accepting the position would immediately learn too much to ever be allowed out of the guild. There were only two possibilities: first, that the camel would perform well enough and be lucky enough to earn a higher, more permanent position within the guild structure, and second, that the man or woman (for women were often used) would be slain in a raid or subsequently killed by the hiring guild.\\n\\n \"I beg of you, do not do it here,\" the man said at length. \"Not where my wife will hear my last cries, not where my sons will find me dead.\"\\n\\n Bitter bile found its way into the back of Entreri\u0027s throat. Never had he been so disgusted, never had he seen a more pitiful human being. He looked around again at the hovel, the rags posing as doors, as walls. There was a single plate, probably used for eating by the entire family, sitting on the single old bench in the room.\\n\\n \"How much do you owe?\" he asked, and though he could hardly believe the words as he spoke them, he knew that he would not be able to bring himself to kill this wretch.\\n\\n The man looked at him curiously. \"A king\u0027s treasure,\" he said. \"Near to thirty gold pieces.\"\\n\\n Entreri nodded, then pulled a pouch from his belt, this one hidden around the back under his dark cloak. He felt the weight as he pulled it free and knew that it held at least fifty gold pieces, but he tossed it to the man anyway.\\n\\n The stunned man caught it and stared at it so intently that Entreri feared his eyeballs would simply fall out of their sockets. Then he looked back to the assassin, his emotions too twisted and turned about for him to have any revealing expression at all on his face.\\n\\n \"On your word that you will not deal with any guilds again once your debt is paid,\" Entreri said. Tour wife and children deserve better.\"\\n\\n The man started to reply, then fell to his knees and started to bow before his savior. Entreri turned about and swept angrily from the hovel, out into the dirty street.\\n\\n He heard the man\u0027s calls following him, cries of thanks and mercy. In truth, and Entreri knew it, there had been no mercy in his actions. He cared nothing for the man or his ugly wife and undoubtedly ugly children. But still he could not kill this pitiful wretch, though he figured he would probably be doing the man a great service if he did put him out of his obvious misery. No, Entreri would not give Kadran Gordeon the satisfaction of putting him through such a dishonorable murder. A camel like this should be work for first year guild members, twelve-year-olds, perhaps, and for Kadran to give such an assignment to one of Entreri\u0027s reputation was surely a tremendous insult.\\n\\n He would not play along.\\n\\n He stormed down the street to his room at the inn where he collected all his things and set out at once, finally coming to the door of the Copper Ante. He had thought to merely press in, for no better reason than to show Dwahvel how ridiculous her threat to shut him out had been. But then he reconsidered and turned away, in no mood for any dealings with Dwahvel, in no mood for any dealings with anybody.\\n\\n He found a small, nondescript tavern across town and took a room. Likely he was on the grounds of another guild, and if they found out who he was and who he was affiliated with there might be trouble.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t care.\\n\\n A day slipped by unremarkably, but that did little to put Entreri at ease. Much was happening, he knew, and all of it in quiet shadows. He had the wherewithal and understanding of those shadows to go out and discern much, but he hadn\u0027t the ambition to do so. He was in a mood to simply let things fall as they might.\\n\\n He went down to the common room of the little inn that second night, taking his meal to an empty corner, eating alone and hearing nothing of the several conversations going on about the place. He did note the entrance of one character, though, a halfling, and the little folk were not common in this region of the city. Soon enough the halfling found him, taking a seat on the long bench opposite the table from the assassin.\\n\\n \"Good evening to you, fine sir,\" the little one said. \"And how do you find your meal?\"\\n\\n Entreri studied the halfling, understanding that this one held no interest at all in his food. He looked for a weapon on the halfling, though he doubted that Dwahvel would ever be so bold as to move against him.\\n\\n \"Might I taste it?\" the halfling said rather loudly, coming forward over the table.\\n\\n Entreri, picking up the cues, held a spoon of the gruel up but did not extend his arm, allowing the halfling to inconspicuously move even closer.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve come from Dwahvel,\" the little one said as he moved in. \"The Basadoni Guild seeks you, and they are in a foul mood. They know where you are and have received permission from the Rakers to come and collect you. Expect them this very night.\" The halfling took the bite as he finished, then moved back across the table, rubbing his belly.\\n\\n \"Tell Dwahvel that now I am in her debt,\" Entreri remarked. The little one, with a slight nod, moved back across the room and ordered a bowl of gruel. He took up a conversation with the innkeeper while he was waiting for it and ate it right at the bar, leaving Entreri to his thoughts.\\n\\n He could flee, the assassin realized, but his heart was not in such a course. No, he decided, let them come and let this be done. He didn\u0027t think they meant to kill him in any case. He finished his meal and went back to his room to consider his options. First, he pulled a board from the inner wall, and in the cubby space between that and the outer wall, reaching down to a beam well below the floor in his room, he placed his fabulous jeweled dagger and many of his coins. Then he carefully replaced the board and replaced the dagger on his belt with another from his pack, one that somewhat resembled his signature dagger but without the powerful enchantment. Then, more for appearances than as any deterrent, he wired a basic dart trap about his door and moved across the room, settling into the one chair in the place. He took out some dice and began throwing them on the small night table beside the chair, making up games and passing the hours.\\n\\n It was late indeed when he heard the first footsteps coming up the stairs-a man obviously trying to be stealthy but making more noise than the skilled Entreri would make even if he were walking normally. Entreri listened more carefully as the walking ceased, and he caught the scrape of a thin slice of metal moving about the crack between the door and the jamb. A fairly skilled thief could get through his impromptu trap in a matter of a couple of minutes, he knew, so he put his hands behind his head and leaned back against the wall.\\n\\n All the noise stopped, a long and uncomfortable silence.\\n\\n Entreri sniffed the air; something was burning. For a moment, he thought they might be razing the building around him, but then he recognized the smell, that of burning leather, and as he shifted to look down at his own belt he felt a sharp pain on his collarbone. The chain of a necklace he wore-one that held several lock picks cunningly designed as ornaments-had slipped off his shirt and onto his bare skin.\\n\\n Only then did the assassin understand that all of his metallic items had grown red hot.\\n\\n Entreri jumped up and tore the necklace from his neck, then deftly, with a twist of his wrist, dropped his belt and the heated dagger to the floor.\\n\\n The door burst in, a Basadoni soldier rolling to either side and a third man, crossbow leveled, rushing between them.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t fire, though, nor did the others, their swords in hand, charge in.\\n\\n Kadran Gordeon walked in behind the bowman.\\n\\n \"A simple knock would have proven as effective,\" Entreri said dryly, looking down at his glowing equipment. The dagger caused the wood of the floor to send up a trail of black smoke.\\n\\n In response, Gordeon threw a coin at Entreri\u0027s feet, a strange golden coin imprinted with the unicorn head emblem on the side showing to the assassin.\\n\\n Entreri looked up at Gordeon and merely shrugged.\\n\\n \"The camel was to be killed,\" Gordeon said.\\n\\n \"He was not worth the effort.\"\\n\\n \"And that is for you to decide?\" the Basadoni lieutenant asked incredulously.\\n\\n \"A minor decision, compared to what I once-\"\\n\\n \"Ah!\" Gordeon interrupted dramatically. \"Therein lies the flaw, Master Entreri. What you once knew, or did, or were told to do, is irrelevant, you see. You are no guildmaster, no lieutenant, not even a full soldier as of yet, and I doubt that ever you will be! You lost your nerve-as I thought you would. You are only gaining approval, and if you survive that time, perhaps, just perhaps, you will find your way back into complete acceptance within the guild.\"\\n\\n \"Gaining approval?\u0027 Entreri echoed with a laugh. \"Yours?\"\\n\\n \"Take him!\" Gordeon instructed the two soldiers who had come in first. As they moved cautiously for the assassin Gordeon added, \"The man you tried to save was executed, as were his wife and children.\"\\n\\n Entreri hardly heard the words and hardly cared anyway, though he knew that Gordeon had ordered the extended execution merely to throw some pain his way. Now he had a bigger dilemma. Should he allow Gordeon to take him back to the guild, where he would no doubt be physically punished and then released?\\n\\n No, he would not suffer such treatment by this man or any other. The muscles in his legs, so finely honed, tensed as the two approached, though Entreri seemed perfectly at ease, even held his empty arms out in an unthreatening posture.\\n\\n The men, swords in hand, came in at his sides, reaching for those arms while the third soldier kept his crossbow steady, aimed at the assassin\u0027s heart.\\n\\n Up into the air went Entreri, a great vertical spring, tucking his legs under him and then kicking out to the sides before the startled soldiers could react, connecting squarely on the faces of both the approaching men and sending them flying away. He did catch the one on his right as he landed, and pulled the man in quickly, just in time to serve as a shield for the firing crossbow. Then he tossed the groaning man to the ground.\\n\\n \"First mistake,\" he said to Gordeon as the lieutenant drew out a splendid-looking sabre. Off to the side the other kicked soldier climbed back to his feet, but the one on the floor in front of Entreri, a crossbow quarrel deep into his back, wasn\u0027t moving. The crossbowman worked hard on the crank, loading another bolt, but even more disturbing for Entreri was the fact that there was obviously a wizard nearby.\\n\\n \"Stay back,\" Gordeon ordered the man to the side. \"I will finish this one.\"\\n\\n \"To make your reputation?\" Entreri asked. \"But I have no weapon. How will that sound on the streets of Calimport?\"\\n\\n \"After you are dead we will place a weapon in your hand,\" Gordeon said with a wicked grin. \"My men will insist that it was a fair fight.\"\\n\\n \"Second mistake,\" Entreri said under his breath, for indeed, it was a fairer fight than the skilled Kadran Gordeon could ever understand. The Basadoni lieutenant came in with a measured thrust, straight ahead, and Entreri slapped his forearm out to intercept, purposely missing the parry but skittering backward out of reach at the same time. Gordeon circle, and so did Entreri. Then the assassin came ahead in a short lunge and was forced back with a slice of the sabre, Gordeon taking care to allow no openings.\\n\\n But Entreri had no intention of following through his movement anyway. He had only begun it so that he could slightly alter the angle of the circling, putting him in line for his next strike.\\n\\n On came Gordeon, and Entreri leaped back. When Gordeon kept coming, the assassin went ahead in a short burst, forcing him into a cunning and dangerous parrying maneuver. But again, Entreri didn\u0027t follow through. He just fell back to the appropriate spot and, to the surprise of all in the room, stamped his foot hard on the floor.\\n\\n \"What?\" Gordeon asked, shaking his head and looking about, for he didn\u0027t keep his eyes down at that stamping foot, didn\u0027t see the shock of the stamp lift the still-glowing necklace from the floor so that Entreri could hook it about his toe.\\n\\n A moment later Gordeon came on hard, this time looking for the kill. Out snapped Entreri\u0027s foot, launching the necklace at the lieutenant\u0027s face. To his credit, the swift-handed Gordeon snapped his free hand across and caught the necklace-as Entreri had expected-but then how he howled, the glowing chain enwrapping his bare hand and digging a fiery line across his flesh.\\n\\n Entreri was there in the blink of an eye. He slapped the lieutenant\u0027s sword arm out wide. Balling both fists, middle knuckles extended forward, he drove his knuckles simultaneously into the man\u0027s temples. Clearly dazed, his eyes glossed over, Gordeon\u0027s hands slipped to his sides and Entreri snapped his forehead right into the man\u0027s face. He caught Gordeon as he fell back and spun him about, then reached through his legs and caught him by one wrist. With a subtle turn to put Gordeon in line with the crossbowman, Entreri pulled hard, through and up, flipping Gordeon right into the startled soldier. The flipped man knocked the crossbow hard enough to dislodge the bolt.\\n\\n The remaining swordsman came in hard from the side, but he was not a skilled fighter, even by Kadran Gordeon\u0027s standards. Entreri easily backed and dodged his awkward, too-far-ahead thrust, then stepped in quickly, before the man could retract and ready the blade. Reaching down and around to catch his sword arm by the wrist, Entreri lifted hard and stepped under that wrist, twisting the arm painfully and stealing the strength from it.\\n\\n The man came ahead, thinking to grab on for dear life with his free hand. Entreri\u0027s palm slapped against the back of his twisted sword hand quicker than he could even comprehend, then bent the hand down low back over the wrist, stealing all strength and sending a wave of pain through the man. A simple slide of the hand had the sword free in Entreri\u0027s grasp, and a reversal of grip and deft twist brought it in line.\\n\\n Entreri retracted his hand, stabbing the blade out and up behind him into the belly and up into the lungs of the hapless soldier.\\n\\n Moving quickly, not even bothering to pull the sword back out, he spun on the man, thinking to throw him, too, at the crossbowman. And indeed that stubborn archer was once more setting the bolt in place. But a far more dangerous foe appeared, the unseen wizard, rushing down the hallway, robes flapping, across the door. Entreri saw the man lift something slender-a wand, he supposed-but then all he saw was a tumble of arms and legs as the skewered swordsman crashed into the wizard and both went flying away.\\n\\n \"Have I yet gained your approval?\" Entreri yelled at the still dazed Gordeon, but he was moving even as he spoke, for the crossbowman had him dead and the wizard was fast regaining his footing. He felt the terrible flash of pain as a quarrel dug through his side, but he gritted his teeth and growled away the pain, putting his arms in front of his face and tucking his legs up defensively as he crashed through the wooden-latticed window, soaring down the ten feet to the street. He turned his legs as he hit, throwing himself into a sidelong roll, and then another to absorb the shock of the fall. He was up and running, not surprised at all when another crossbow quarrel, fired from a completely different direction, embedded itself into the wall right beside him.\\n\\n All the area erupted with movement as Basadoni soldiers came out of every conceivable hiding place.\\n\\n Entreri sprinted down one alley, leaped right over a huge man bending low in an attempt to tackle him at the waist, then cut fast around a building. Up to the roof he went, quick as a cat, then across, leaping another alley to another roof, and so on.\\n\\n He went down the main street, for he knew that his pursuers were expecting him to drop into an alley. He went up fast on the side of one wall, expertly setting himself there, arms and legs splayed wide to find tentative holds and to blend with the contours of the building.\\n\\n Cries of \"Find him!\" echoed all about, and many soldiers ran right below his perch, but those cries diminished as the night wore on. Fortunately so for Entreri, who, though he was not losing much blood outwardly, understood that his wound was serious, perhaps even mortal. Finally he was able to slide down from his perch, hardly finding the remaining strength to even stand. He put a hand to his side and felt the warm blood, thick in the folds of his cloak, and felt, too, the very back edge of the deeply embedded quarrel.\\n\\n He could hardly draw breath now. He knew what that meant.\\n\\n Luck was with him when he got back to the inn, for the sun had not yet come up, and though there were obviously Basadoni soldiers within the place, few were about the immediate area. Entreri found the window of his room easily enough from the broken wood on the ground and calculated the height of his hidden store. He had to be quiet, for he heard voices, Gordeon\u0027s among them, from within his room. Up he went, finding a secure perch, trying hard not to groan, though in truth he wanted to scream from the pain.\\n\\n He worked the old, weather-beaten wood slowly and quietly until he could pull enough away to retrieve his dagger and small pouch.\\n\\n \"He had to have some magic about him!\" he heard Gordeon scream. \"Cast your detection again!\"\\n\\n \"There is no magic, Master Gordeon,\" came another voice, the wizard\u0027s obviously. \"If he had any, then likely he sold it or gave it away before he ever came to this place.\"\\n\\n Despite his agony, Entreri managed a smile as he heard Gordeon\u0027s subsequent growl and kick. No magic indeed, because they had searched in his room only and not the wall of the room below.\\n\\n Dagger in hand, the assassin made his way along the still-quiet streets. He hoped to find a Basadoni soldier about, one deserving his wrath, but in truth he doubted he could even muster the strength to beat a novice fighter. What he found instead was a pair of drunks, laying against the side of a building, one sleeping, the other talking to himself.\\n\\n Silent as death, the assassin stalked in. His jeweled dagger possessed a particularly useful magic, for it could steal the life of a victim and give that energy to its wielder.\\n\\n Entreri took the talking drunk first, and when he was finished, feeling so much stronger, he bit down hard on a fold of his cloak and yanked the crossbow bolt from his side, nearly fainting as waves of agony assaulted him.\\n\\n He steadied himself, though, and fell over the sleeping drunk.\\n\\n He walked out of the alley soon after, showing no signs that he had been so badly wounded. He felt strong again and almost hoped he would find Kadran Gordeon still in the area.\\n\\n But the fight had only begun, he knew, and despite his supreme skills, he remembered well the extent of the Basadoni Guild and understood that he was sorely overmatched.\\n\\n They had watched those intent on killing him enter the inn. They had watched him come crashing through the window in full flight, then run on into the shadows. With eyes superior to those of the Basadoni soldiers, they had spotted him splayed on the wall and silently applauded his stealthy trick. And now, with some measure of relief and many nods that their leader had chosen wisely, they watched him exit the alley. And even he, Artemis Entreri, assassin of assassins, had no idea they were about. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-10.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
