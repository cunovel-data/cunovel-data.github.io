{"id":94488,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"Part 3 CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF THE BOTTOM I watched the miles roll out behind me, whether walking down a road or sailing fast out of Waterdeep for the southlands, putting distance between us and the friend we four had left behind. The friend? Many times during those long and arduous days, each of us in our own little space came to wonder about that word \"friend\" and the responsibilities such a label might carry. We had left Wulfgar behind in the wilds of the Spine of the World no less and had no idea if he was well, if he was even still alive. Could a true friend so desert another? Would a true friend allow a man to walk alone along troubled and dangerous paths? Often I ponder the meaning of that word. Friend. It seems such an obvious thing, friendship, and yet often it becomes so very complicated. Should I have stopped Wulfgar, even knowing and admitting that he had his own road to walk? Or should I have gone with him? Or should we all four have shadowed him, watching over him? I think not, though I admit that I know not for certain. There is a fine line between friendship and parenting, and when that line is crossed, the result is often disastrous. A parent who strives to make a true friend of his or her child may well sacrifice authority, and though that parent may be comfortable with surrendering the dominant position, the unintentional result will be to steal from that child the necessary guidance and, more importantly, the sense of security the parent is supposed to impart. On the opposite side, a friend who takes a role as parent forgets the most important ingredient of friendship: respect. For respect is the guiding principle of friendship, the lighthouse beacon that directs the course of any true friendship. And respect demands trust. Thus, the four of us pray for Wulfgar and intend that our paths will indeed cross again. Though we\u0027ll often look back over our shoulders and wonder, we hold fast to our understanding of friendship, of trust, and of respect. We accept, grudgingly but resolutely, our divergent paths. Surely Wulfgar\u0027s trials have become my trials in many ways, but I see now that the friendship of mine most in flux is not the one with the barbarian-not from my perspective, anyway, since I understand that Wulfgar alone must decide the depth and course of our bond-but my relationship with Cattibrie. Our love for each other is no secret between us, or to anyone else watching us (and I fear that perhaps the bond that has grown between us might have had some influence in Wulfgar\u0027s painful decisions), but the nature of that love remains a mystery to me and to Catti-brie. We have in many ways become as brother and sister, and surely I am closer to her than I could ever have been to any of my natural siblings! For several years we had only each other to count on and both learned beyond any doubt that the other would always be there. I would die for her, and she for me. Without hesitation, without doubt. Truly in all the world there is no one, not even Bruenor, Wulfgar, or Regis, or even Zaknafein, with whom I would rather spend my time. There is no one who can view a sunrise beside me and better understand the emotions that sight always stirs within me. There is no one who can fight beside me and better compliment my movements. There is no one who better knows all that is in my heart and thoughts, though I had not yet spoken a word. But what does that mean? Surely I feel a physical attraction to Catti-brie as well. She is possessed of a combination of innocence and a playful wickedness. For all her sympathy and empathy and compassion, there is an edge to Catti-brie that makes potential enemies tremble in fear and potential lovers tremble in anticipation. I believe that she feels similarly toward me, and yet we both understand the dangers of this uncharted territory, dangers more frightening than any physical enemy we have ever known. I am drow, and young, and with the dawn and twilight of several centuries ahead of me. She is human and, though young, with merely decades of life ahead of her. Of course, Catti-brie\u0027s life is complicated enough merely having a drow elf as a traveling companion and friend. What troubles might she find if she and I were more than that? And what might the world think of our children, if ever that path we walked? Would any society in all the world accept them? I know how I feel when I look upon her, though, and believe that I understand her feelings as well. On that level, it seems such an obvious thing, and yet, alas, it becomes so very complicated. Chapter 13 SECRET WEAPON You have found the rogue?\" Jarlaxle asked Rai\u0027gy Bondalek. Kimmuriel Oblodra stood beside the mercenary leader, the psionicist appearing unarmed and unarmored, seeming perfectly defenseless to one who did not understand the powers of his mind. \"He is with a dwarf, a woman, and a halfling,\" Rai\u0027gy answered. \"And sometimes they are joined by a great black cat.\" \"Guenhwyvar,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"Once the property of Masoj Hun\u0027ette. A powerful magical item indeed.\" \"But not the greatest magic that they carry,\" Rai\u0027gy informed. \"There is another, stored in a pouch on the rogue\u0027s belt, that radiates magic stronger than all their other magics combined. Even through the distance of my scrying it beckoned to me, almost as if it were asking me to retrieve it from its present unworthy owner.\" \"What could it be?\" the always opportunistic mercenary asked. Rai\u0027gy shook his head, his shock of white hair flying from side to side. \"Like no dweomer I have seen before,\" he admitted. \"Is that not the way of magic?\" Kimmuriel Oblodra put in with obvious distaste. \"Unknown and uncontrollable.\" Rai\u0027gy shot the psionicist an angry glare, but Jarlaxle, more than willing to utilize both magic and psionics, merely smiled. \"Learn more about it and about them,\" he instructed the wizard-priest. \"If it beckons to us, then perhaps we would be wise to heed its call. How far are they, and how fast can we get to them?\" \"Very,\" Rai\u0027gy answered. \"And very. They had begun an overland route but were accosted by giantkind and goblinkin at every bend in the path.\" \"Perhaps the magical item is not particular about who it calls for a new owner,\" Kimmuriel remarked with obvious sarcasm. \"They turned about and took ship,\" Rai\u0027gy went on, ignoring the comment. \"Out of the great northern city of Waterdeep, I believe, far, far up the Sword Coast.\" \"But sailing south?\" Jarlaxle asked hopefully. \"I believe,\" Rai\u0027gy answered. \"It does not matter. There are magics, of course, and mind powers,\" he added, nodding deferentially to Kimmuriel, \"that can get us to them as easily as if they were standing in the next room.\" \"Back to your searching, then,\" Jarlaxle said. \"But are we not to visit a guild this very night?\" Rai\u0027gy asked. \"You will not be needed,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Minor guilds alone will meet this night.\" \"Even minor guilds would be wise to employ wizards,\" the wizard-priest remarked. \"The wizard of this one is a friend of Entreri,\" Jarlaxle explained with a laugh that made it sound as if it were all too easy. \"And the other guild is naught but halflings, hardly versed in the ways of magic. Tomorrow night you will be needed, perhaps. This night continue your examination of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. In the end he will likely prove the most important cog of all.\" \"Because of the magical item?\" Kimmuriel asked. \"Because of Entreri\u0027s lack of interest,\" Jarlaxle replied. The wizard-priest shook his head. \"We offer him power and riches beyond his comprehension,\" he said. \"And yet he leads us onward as if he were going into hopeless battle against the Spider Queen herself.\" \"He cannot appreciate the power or the riches until he has resolved an inner conflict,\" explained Jarlaxle, whose greatest gift of all was the ability to get into the minds of enemies and friends alike, and not with prying powers, such as Kimmuriel Oblodra might use, but with simple empathy and understanding. \"But fear not his present lack of motivation. I know Artemis Entreri well enough to understand that he will prove more than effective whether his heart is in the fight or not. As humans go I have never met one more dangerous or more devious.\" \"A pity his skin is so light,\" Kimmuriel remarked. Jarlaxle only smiled. He knew well enough that if Artemis Entreri had been born drow in Menzoberranzan the man would have been among the greatest of weapon masters, or perhaps he would have even exceeded that claim. Perhaps he would have been a rival to Jarlaxle for control of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. \"We will speak in the comfortable darkness of the tunnels when the shining hellfire rises into the too-high sky,\" he said to Rai\u0027gy. \"Have more answers for me.\" \"Fare well with the guilds,\" Rai\u0027gy answered, and with a bow he turned and left. Jarlaxle turned to Kimmuriel and nodded. It was time to go hunting. With their cherubic faces, halflings were regarded by the other races as creatures with large eyes, but how much wider those eyes became for the four in the room with Dwahvel when a magical portal opened right before them (despite the usual precautions against such magical intrusion), and Artemis Entreri stepped into the room. The assassin cut an impressive figure in a layered black coat and a black bolero, banded about the base of its riser in blacker silk. Entreri assumed a strong, hands-on-hips pose just as Kimmuriel had taught him, holding steady against the waves of disorientation that always accompanied such psionic dimensional travel. Behind him, in the chamber on the other side of the door, a room lightless save that spilling in through the gate from Dwahvel\u0027s chamber, huddled a few dark shapes. When one of the halfling soldiers moved to meet the intruder, one of those dark shapes shifted slightly, and the halfling, with hardly a squeak, toppled to the floor. \"He is sleeping and otherwise unharmed,\" Entreri quickly explained, not wanting a fight with the others, who were scrambling about for weapons. \"I did not come here for a fight, I assure you, but I can leave all of you dead in my wake if you insist upon one.\" \"You could have used the front door,\" Dwahvel, the only one appearing unshaken, remarked dryly. \"I did not wish to be seen entering your establishment,\" the assassin, fully oriented once more, explained. \"For your protection.\" \"And what form of entrance is this?\" Dwahvel asked. \"Magical and unbidden, yet none of my wards-and I paid well for them, I assure you-offered resistance.\" \"No magic that will concern you,\" Entreri replied, \"but that will surely concern my enemies. Know that I did not return to Calimport to lurk in shadows at the bidding of others. I have traveled the Realms extensively and have brought back with me that which I have learned.\" \"So Artemis Entreri returns as the conqueror,\" Dwahvel remarked. Beside her the soldiers bristled, but Dwahvel did well to hold them in check. Now that Entreri was among them, to fight him would cost her dearly, she realized. Very dearly. \"Perhaps,\" Entreri conceded. \"We shall see how it goes.\" \"It will take more than a display of teleportation to convince me to throw the weight of my guild behind you,\" Dwahvel said calmly. \"To choose wrongly in such a war would prove fatal.\" \"I do not wish you to choose at all,\" Entreri assured her. Dwahvel eyed him suspiciously, then turned to each of her trusted guards. They, too, wore doubting expressions. \"Then why bother to come to me?\" she asked. \"To inform you that a war is about to begin,\" Entreri answered. \"I owe you that much, at least.\" \"And perhaps you wish for me to open wide my ears that you may learn how goes the fight,\" the sly halfling reasoned. \"As you wish,\" Entreri replied. \"When this is finished, and I have found control, I will not forget all that you have already done for me.\" \"And if you lose?\" Entreri laughed. \"Be wary,\" he said. \"And, for your health, Dwahvel Tiggerwillies, be neutral. I owe you and see our friendship as to the benefit of both, but if I learn that you betray me by word or by deed, I will bring your house down around you.\" With that, he gave a polite bow, a tip of the black bolero and slipped back through the portal. One globe of darkness after another filled Dwahvel\u0027s chamber, forcing her and the three standing soldiers to crawl about helplessly until one found the normal exit and called the others to him. Finally the darkness abated, and the halflings dared to re-enter, to find their sleeping companion snoring contentedly, and then to find, upon searching the body, a small dart stuck into his shoulder. \"Entreri has friends,\" one of them remarked. Dwahvel merely nodded, not surprised and glad indeed at that moment that she had previously chosen to help the outcast assassin. He was not a man Dwahvel Tiggerwillies wished for an enemy. \"Ah, but you make my life so dangerous,\" LaValle said with an exaggerated sigh when Entreri, unannounced and uninvited, walked from thin air, it seemed, into LaValle\u0027s private room. \"Well done-on your escape from Kadran Gordeon, I mean,\" LaValle went on when Entreri didn\u0027t immediately respond. The wizard was trying hard to appear collected. Hadn\u0027t Entreri slipped into his guarded room twice before, after all? But this time- and the assassin recognized it splayed on LaValle\u0027s face-he had truly surprised the wizard. Bodeau had sharpened up the defenses of his guild house amazingly well against both magical and physical intrusion. As much as he respected Entreri, LaValle had obviously not expected the assassin to get through so easily. \"Not so difficult a task, I assure you,\" the assassin replied, keeping his voice steady so that his words sounded as simple fact and not a boast. \"I have traveled the world, and under the world and have witnessed powers very different from anything experienced in Calimport. Powers that will bring me that which I desire.\" LaValle sat on an old and comfortable chair, planting one elbow on the worn arm and dropping his head sidelong against his open palm. What was it about this man, he wondered, that so mocked all the ordinary trappings of power? He looked all around at his room, at the many carved statues, gargoyles, and exotic birds, at the assortment of finely carved staves, some magical, some not, at the three skulls grinning from the cubbies atop his desk, at the crystal ball set upon the small table across the way. These were his items of power, items gained through a lifetime of work, items that he could use to destroy or at least to defend against, any single man he had ever met. Except for one. What was it about this one? The way he stood? The way he moved? The simple aura of power that surrounded him, as tangible as the gray cloak and black bolero he now wore? \"Go and bring Quentin Bodeau,\" Entreri instructed. \"He will not appreciate becoming involved.\" \"He already is,\" Entreri assured the wizard. \"Now he must choose.\" \"Between you and ... ?\" LaValle asked. \"The rest of them,\" Entreri replied calmly. LaValle tilted his head curiously. \"You mean to do battle with all of Calimport then?\" he asked skeptically. \"With all in Calimport who oppose me,\" Entreri said, again with the utmost calm. LaValle shook his head, not knowing what to make of it all. He trusted Entreri\u0027s judgment-never had the wizard met a more cunning and controlled man-but the assassin spoke foolishness, it seemed, if he honestly believed he could stand alone against the likes of the Basadonis, let alone the rest of Calimport\u0027s street powers. But still... \"Shall I bring Chalsee Anguaine, as well?\" the wizard asked, standing and heading for the door. \"Chalsee has already been shown the futility of resistance,\" Entreri replied. LaValle stopped abruptly, turning on the assassin as if betrayed. \"I knew you would go along,\" Entreri explained. \"For you have come to know and love me as a brother. The lieutenant\u0027s mind-set, however, remained a mystery. He had to be convinced, or removed.\" LaValle just stared at him, awaiting the verdict. \"He is convinced,\" Entreri remarked, moving to fall comfortably into LaValle\u0027s comfortable chair. \"Very much so. \"And so,\" he continued as the wizard again started for the door, \"will you find Bodeau.\" LaValle turned on him again. \"He will make the right choice,\" Entreri assured the man. \"Will he have a choice?\" LaValle dared to ask. \"Of course not.\" Indeed, when LaValle found Bodeau in his private quarters and informed him that Artemis Entreri had come again the guildmaster blanched white and trembled so violently that LaValle feared he would simply fall over dead on the floor. \"You have spoken with Chalsee then?\" LaValle asked. \"Evil days,\" Bodeau replied, and moving as if he had to battle mind with muscle through every pained step, he headed for the corridor. \"Evil days?\" LaValle echoed incredulously under his breath. What in all the Realms could prompt the master of a murderous guild to make such a statement? Suddenly taking Entreri\u0027s claims more seriously, the wizard fell into step behind Bodeau. He noted, his intrigue mounting ever higher, that the guildmaster ordered no soldiers to follow or even to flank. Bodeau stopped outside the wizard\u0027s door, letting LaValle assume the lead into the room. There in the study sat Entreri, exactly as the wizard had left him. The assassin appeared totally unprepared had Bodeau decided to attack instead of parlay, as if he had known without doubt that Bodeau wouldn\u0027t dare oppose him. \"What do you demand of me?\" Bodeau asked before LaValle could find any opening to the obviously awkward situation. \"I have decided to begin with the Basadonis,\" Entreri calmly replied. \"For they, after all, started this fight. You, then, must locate all of their soldiers, all of their fronts, and a complete layout of their operation, not including the guild house.\" \"I offer to tell no one that you came here and to promise that my soldiers will not interfere,\" Bodeau countered. \"Your soldiers could not interfere,\" Entreri shot back, a flash of anger crossing his black eyes. LaValle watched in continued amazement as Quentin Bodeau fought so very hard to control his shaking. \"And we will not,\" the guildmaster offered. \"I have told you the terms of your survival,\" Entreri said, a coldness creeping into his voice that made LaValle believe that Bodeau and all the guild would be murdered that very night if the guildmaster didn\u0027t agree. \"What say you?\" \"I will consider-\" \"Now.\" Bodeau glared at LaValle, as if blaming the wizard for ever allowing Artemis Entreri into his life, a sentiment that LaValle, as unnerved as Bodeau, could surely understand. \"You ask me to go against the most powerful pashas of the streets,\" Bodeau said, trying hard to find some courage. \"Choose,\" Entreri said. A long, uncomfortable moment slipped past. \"I will see what my soldiers may discern,\" Bodeau promised. \"Very wise,\" said Entreri. \"Now leave us. I wish a word with LaValle.\" More than happy to be away from the man, Bodeau turned on his heel and after another hateful glare at LaValle, swiftly exited the room. \"I do not begin to guess what tricks you have brought with you,\" LaValle said to Entreri. \"I have been to Menzoberranzan,\" Entreri admitted. \"The city of the drow.\" LaValle\u0027s eyes widened, his mouth drooping open. \"I returned with more than trinkets.\" \"You have allied with ...\" \"You are the only one I have told and the only one I shall tell,\" Entreri announced. \"Understand the responsibility that goes with such knowledge. It is one that I shan\u0027t take lightly.\" \"But Chalsee Anguaine?\" LaValle asked. \"You said he had been convinced.\" \"A friend found his mind and there put images too horrible for him to resist,\" Entreri explained. \"Chalsee knows not the truth, only that to resist would bring about a fate too terrible to consider. When he reported to Bodeau his terror was sincere.\" \"And where do I stand in your grand plans?\" the wizard asked, trying very hard not to sound sarcastic. \"If Bodeau fails you, then what of LaValle?\" \"I will show you a way out should that come to pass,\" Entreri promised, walking over to the desk. \"I owe you that much at least.\" He picked up a small dagger LaValle had set there to cut seals on parchments or to prick a finger when a spell called for a component of blood. LaValle understood then that Entreri was being pragmatic, not merciful. If the wizard was indeed spared should Bodeau fail the assassin, it would only be because Entreri had some use for him. \"You are surprised that the guildmaster so readily complied,\" Entreri said evenly. \"You must understand his choice: to risk that I will fail and the Basadonis will win out and then exact revenge on my allies . . . or to die now, this very night, and horribly, I assure you.\" LaValle forced an expressionless set to his visage, playing the role of complete neutrality, even detachment. \"You have much work ahead of you, I assume,\" Entreri said, and he flicked his wrist, sending the dagger soaring past the wizard to knock heavily into the outside wall. \"I take my leave.\" Indeed, as the signal knock against the wall sounded, Kimmuriel Oblodra went into his contemplation again and brought up another dimensional pathway for the assassin to make his exit. LaValle saw the portal open and thought for a moment out of sheer curiosity to leap through it beside Entreri to unmask this great mystery. Good sense overruled curiosity. And then the wizard was alone and very glad of it. \"I do not understand,\" Rai\u0027gy Bondalek said when Entreri rejoined him, Jarlaxle, and Kimmuriel in the complex of tunnels beneath the city that the drow had made their own. He remembered then to speak more slowly, for Entreri, while fairly proficient in the drow language, was not completely fluent, and the wizard-priest didn\u0027t want to bother with the human tongue at all, either by learning it or by wasting the energy necessary to enact a spell that would allow them all to understand each other, whatever language each of them chose to speak. In truth, Bondalek\u0027s decision to force the discussion to continue in the drow language, even when Entreri was with them, was more a choice to keep the human assassin somewhat off-balance. \"It seems, from all you previously said that the halflings would be better suited and more easily convinced to perform the services you just put upon Quentin Bodeau.\" \"I doubt not Dwahvel\u0027s loyalty,\" Entreri replied in the human Calimport tongue, and he eyed Rai\u0027gy with every word. The wizard turned a curious and helpless look over Jarlaxle, and the mercenary, with a laugh at the pettiness of it all, produced an orb from an inside fold of his cloak, held it aloft, and spoke a word of command. Now they would all understand. \"To herself and her well-being, I mean,\" Entreri said, again in the human tongue, though Rai\u0027gy heard it in drow. \"She is no threat.\" \"And pitiful Quentin Bodeau and his lackey wizard are?\" Rai\u0027gy asked incredulously, Jarlaxle\u0027s enchantment reversing the effect, so that, while the drow spoke in his native tongue, Entreri heard it in his own. \"Do not underestimate the power of Bodeau\u0027s guild,\" Entreri warned. \"They are firmly entrenched, with eyes ever outward.\" \"So you force his loyalty early,\" Jarlaxle agreed, that he cannot later claim ignorance whatever the outcome.\" \"And where from here?\" Kimmuriel asked. \"We secure the Basadoni Guild,\" Entreri explained. \"That then becomes our base of power, with both Dwahvel and Bodeau watching to make certain that the others aren\u0027t aligning against us.\" \"And from there?\" Kimmuriel pressed. Entreri smiled and looked to Jarlaxle, and the mercenary leader recognized that Entreri understood that Kimmuriel was asking the questions as Jarlaxle had bade him to ask. \"From there we will see what opportunities present themselves,\" Jarlaxle answered before Entreri could reply. \"Perhaps that base will prove solid enough. Perhaps not.\" Later on, after Entreri had left them, Jarlaxle, with some pride, turned to his two cohorts. \"Did I not choose well?\" he asked. \"He thinks like a drow,\" Rai\u0027gy replied, offering as high a compliment as Jarlaxle had ever heard him give to a human or to anyone else who was not drow. \"Though I wish he would better learn our language and our sign language.\" Jarlaxle, so pleased with the progress, only laughed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-14.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
