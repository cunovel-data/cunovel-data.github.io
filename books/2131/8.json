{"id":94482,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"You cannot come in,\" the squeaky voice said from behind the barricade. \"Please, sir, I beg you. Go away.\" Entreri hardly found the halfling\u0027s nervous tone amusing, for the implications of the shut-out rang dangerously in his mind. He and Dwahvel had cut a deal- a mutually beneficial deal and one that seemed to favor the halfling, if anyone-and yet, now it seemed as if Dwahvel was going back on her word. Her doorman would not even let the assassin into the Copper Ante. Entreri entertained the thought of kicking in the barricade, but only briefly. He reminded himself that halflings were often adept at setting traps. Then he thought he might slip his dagger through the slit in the boards, into the impertinent doorman\u0027s arm, or thumb, or whatever other target presented itself. That was the beauty of Entreri\u0027s dagger: he could stick someone anywhere and suck the lifeforce right out of him. But again, it was a fleeting thought, more of a fantasy wrought of frustration than any action the ever-careful Entreri would seriously consider. \"So I shall go,\" he said calmly. \"But do inform Dwahvel that my world is divided between friends and enemies.\" He turned and started away, leaving the doorman in a fluster. \"My, but that sounded like a threat,\" came another voice before Entreri had moved ten paces down the street. The assassin stopped and considered a small crack in the wall of the Copper Ante, a peep hole, he realized, and likely an arrow slit. \"Dwahvel,\" he said with a slight bow. To his surprise, the crack widened and a panel slid aside. Dwahvel walked out in the open. \"So quick to name enemies,\" she said, shaking her head, her curly brown locks bouncing gaily. \"But I did not,\" the assassin replied. \"Though it did anger me that you apparently decided not to go through with our deal.\" Dwahvel\u0027s face tightened suddenly, stealing the up-to-then lighthearted tone. \"Kelp-enwalled,\" she explained, an expression more common to the fishing boats than the streets, but one Entreri had heard before. On the fishing boats, \"kelp-enwalling\" referred to the practice of isolating particularly troublesome pincer crabs, which had to be delivered live to market, by building barricades of kelp strands about them. The term was less literal, but with similar meaning, on the street. A kelp-enwalled person had been declared off-limits, surrounded and isolated by barricades of threats. Suddenly Entreri\u0027s expression also showed the strain. \"The order came from greater guilds than mine, from guilds that could, and would, burn the Copper Ante to the ground and kill all of my fellows with hardly a thought,\" Dwahvel said with a shrug. \"Entreri is kelp-enwalled, so they said. You cannot blame me for refusing your entrance.\" Entreri nodded. He above many others could appreciate pragmatism for the sake of survival. \"Yet you chose to come out and speak with me,\" he said. Another shrug from Dwahvel. \"Only to explain why our deal has ended,\" she said. \"And to ensure that I do not fall into the latter category you detailed for my doorman. I will offer to you this much, with no charge for services. Everyone knows now that you have returned, and your mere presence has made them all nervous. Old Basadoni still rules his guild, but he is in the shadows now, more a figurehead than a leader. Those handling the affairs of the Basadoni Guild, and the other guilds, for that matter, do not know you. But they do know your reputation. Thus they fear you as they fear each other. Might not Pasha Wroning fear that the Rakers have hired Entreri to kill him? Or even within the individual guilds, might those vying for position before the coming event of Pasha Basadoni\u0027s death not fear that one of the others has coaxed Entreri back to assure personal ascension?\" Entreri nodded again but replied, \"Or is it not possible that Artemis Entreri has merely returned to his home?\" \"Of course,\" Dwahvel said. \"But until they all learn the truth of you, they will fear you, and the only way to learn the truth-\" \"Kelp-enwalled,\" the assassin finished. He started to thank Dwahvel for showing the courage of coming out to tell him this much, but he stopped short. He recognized that perhaps the halfling was only following orders, that perhaps this meeting was part of the surveying process. \"Watch well your back,\" Dwahvel added, moving for the secret door. \"You understand that there are many who would like to claim the head of Entreri for their trophy wall.\" \"What do you know?\" the assassin asked, for it seemed obvious to him that Dwahvel wasn\u0027t speaking merely in generalities here. \"Before the kelp-enwalling order, my spies went out to learn what they may about the perceptions concerning your return,\" she explained. \"They were asked more questions than they offered and often by young, strong assassins. Watch well your back.\" And then she was gone, back through the secret door into the Copper Ante. Entreri just blew a sigh and walked along. He didn\u0027t question his return to Calimport, for either way it simply didn\u0027t seem important to him. Nor did he start looking more deeply into the shadows that lined the dark street. Perhaps one or more held his killer. Perhaps not. Perhaps it simply did not matter. \"Perry,\" Giunta the Diviner said to Kadran Gordeon as the two watched the young thug steal along the rooftops, shadowing, from a very safe distance, the movements of Artemis Entreri. \"A lieutenant for Bodeau.\" \"Is he watching?\" Kadran asked. \"Hunting,\" the wizard corrected. Kadran didn\u0027t doubt the man. Giunta\u0027s entire life had been spent in observation. This wizard was the watcher, and from the patterns of those he observed he could then predict with an amazing degree of accuracy their next movements. \"Why would Bodeau risk everything to go after Entreri?\" the fighter asked. \"Surely he knows of the kelp-enwalling order, and Entreri has a long alliance with that particular guild.\" \"You presume that Bodeau even knows of this,\" Giunta explained. \"I have seen this one before. Dog Perry, he is called, though he fancies himself \u0027the Heart.\u0027\" That nickname rang a chime of recognition in Kadran. \"For his practice of cutting a still-beating heart from the chest of his victims,\" the man remarked. \"A brash young killer,\" he added, nodding, for now it made sense. \"Not unlike one I know,\" Giunta said slyly, turning his gaze over Kadran. Kadran smiled in reply. Indeed, Dog Perry was not so unlike a younger Kadran, brash and skilled. The years had taught Kadran some measure of humility, however, though many of those who knew him well thought he was still a bit deficient in that regard. He looked more closely at Dog Perry now, the man moving silently and carefully along the rim of a rooftop. Yes, there seemed a resemblance to the young thug Kadran used to be. Less polished and less wise, obviously, for even in his cocky youth Kadran doubted that he would have gone after the likes of Artemis Entreri so soon after the man\u0027s return to Calimport and obviously without too much preparation. \"He must have allies in the region,\" Kadran remarked to Giunta. \"Seek out the other rooftops. Surely the young thug would not be foolish enough to hunt Entreri alone.\" Giunta widened his scan. He found Entreri moving easily along the main boulevard and recognized many other characters in the area, regulars who held no known connection to Bodeau\u0027s guild or to Dog Perry. \"Him,\" the wizard explained, pointing to another figure weaving in and out of the shadows, following the same route as Entreri, but far, far behind. \"Another of Bodeau\u0027s men, I believe.\" \"He does not seem overly intent on joining the fight,\" Kadran noted, for the man seemed to hesitate with every step. He was so far behind Entreri and losing ground with each passing second that he could have jumped out and run full speed at the man down the middle of the street without being noticed by the pursued assassin. \"Perhaps he is merely observing,\" Giunta remarked as he moved the focus of the crystal ball back to the two assassins, their paths beginning to intersect, \"following his ally at the request of Bodeau to see how Dog Perry fares. There are many possibilities, but if he does mean to get into the fight beside Dog Perry, then he should run fast. Entreri is not one to drag out a battle, and it seems-\" He stopped abruptly as Dog Perry moved to the edge of a roof and crouched low, muscles tensing. The young assassin had found his spot of ambush, and Entreri turned into the ally, seemingly playing into the man\u0027s hand. \"We could warn him,\" Kadran said, licking his lips nervously. \"Entreri is already on his guard,\" the wizard explained. \"Surely he has sensed my scrying. A man of his talents could not be magically looked at without his knowledge.\" the wizard gave a little chuckle. \"Farewell, Dog Perry,\" he said. Even as the words came out of his mouth, the would-be assassin leaped down from the roof, hitting the ground in a rush barely three strides behind Entreri, closing so fast that almost any man would have been skewered before he even registered the noise behind him. Almost any man. Entreri spun as Dog Perry rushed in, Perry\u0027s slender sword leading. A brush of the spinning assassin\u0027s left hand, holding the ample folds of his cloak as further protection, deflected the blow wide. Ahead went Entreri, a sudden step, pushing up with his left hand, lifting Dog Perry\u0027s arm as he went. He moved right under the now off-balance would-be killer, stabbing up into the armpit with his jeweled dagger as he passed. Then, so quickly that Dog Perry never had a chance to compensate, so quickly that Kadran and Giunta hardly noticed the subtle turn, he pivoted back, turning to face Dog Perry\u0027s back. Entreri tore the dagger free and flipped it to his descending left hand, snapped his right hand around to the chin of the would-be killer, and kicked the man in the back of the knees, buckling his legs and forcing him back and down. The older assassin\u0027s left hand stabbed up, driving the dagger under the back of Dog Perry\u0027s skull and deep into his brain. Entreri retracted the dagger immediately and let the dead man fall to the ground, blood pooling under him, so quickly and so efficiently that Entreri didn\u0027t even have a drop of blood on him. Giunta, laughing, pointed to the end of the ally, back on the street, where the stunned companion of Dog Perry took one look at the victorious Entreri, turned on his heel, and ran away. \"Yes, indeed,\" Giunta remarked. \"Let the word go out on the streets that Artemis Entreri has returned.\" Kadran Gordeon spent a long while staring at the dead man. He struck his customary pensive pose, pursing his lips so that his long and curvy mustache tilted on his dark face. He had entertained the idea of going after Entreri himself, and now was quite plainly shocked by the sheer skill of the man. It was Gordeon\u0027s first true experience with Entreri, and suddenly he understood that the man had come by his reputation honestly. But Kadran Gordeon was not Dog Perry, was far more skilled than that young humbler. Perhaps he would indeed pay a visit to this former king of assassins. \"Exquisite,\" came Sharlotta\u0027s voice behind the two. They turned to see the woman staring past them into the image in Giunta\u0027s large crystal ball. \"Pasha Basadoni told me I would be impressed. How well he moves!\" \"Shall I repay the Bodeau guild for breaking the kelp-enwalling order?\" Kadran asked. \"Forget them,\" Sharlotta retorted, moving closer, her eyes twinkling with admiration. \"Concentrate our attention upon that one alone. Find him and enlist him. Let us find a job for Artemis Entreri.\" Drizzt found Catti-brie sitting on the back lip of the wagon. Regis sat next to her, holding a cloth to her face. Bruenor, axe swinging dangerously at his side, pacing back and forth, grumbled a stream of curses. The drow knew at once what had happened, the simple truth of it anyway, and when he considered it, he was not so surprised that Wulfgar had struck out. \"He did not mean to do it,\" Catti-brie said to Bruenor, trying to calm the volatile dwarf. She, too, was obviously angry, but she, like Drizzt, understood better the truth of Wulfgar\u0027s emotional turmoil. \"I\u0027m thinking he wasn\u0027t seein\u0027 me,\" the woman went on, speaking more to Drizzt. \"Looking back at Errtu\u0027s torments, by me guess.\" Drizzt nodded. \"As it was at the beginning of the fight with the giants,\" he said. \"And so ye\u0027re to let it go?\" Bruenor roared in reply. \"Ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027 that ye can\u0027t hold the boy responsible? Bah! I\u0027ll give him a beating that\u0027ll make his years with Errtu seem easy! Go and get him, elf. Bring him back that he can tell me girl he\u0027s sorry. Then he can tell me. Then he can find me fist in his mouth and take a good long sleep to think about it!\" With a growl, Bruenor drove his axe deep into the ground. \"I heared too much o\u0027 this Errtu,\" he declared. \"Ye can\u0027t be livin\u0027 in what\u0027s already done!\" Drizzt had little doubt that if Wulfgar walked back into camp at that moment, it would take him, Catti-brie, Regis, Camlaine, and all his companions just to pull Bruenor off the man. And in looking at Catti-brie, one eye swollen, her bloody nose bright red, the ranger wasn\u0027t sure he would be too quick to hold the dwarf back. Without another word Drizzt turned and walked away, out of the camp and into the darkness. Wulfgar couldn\u0027t have gone far, he knew, though the night was not so dark with the big moon shining bright across the tundra. Just outside the campsite he took out his figurine. Guenhwyvar led the way, rushing into the darkness and growling back to guide the running ranger. To Drizzt\u0027s surprise the trail led neither south nor back to the northeast and Ten Towns, but straight east, toward the towering black peaks of the Spine of the World. Soon Guenhwyvar led him into the foothills, dangerous territory indeed, for the high bluffs and rocky outcroppings provided fine ambush points for lurking monsters or highwaymen. Perhaps, Drizzt mused, that was exactly why Wulfgar had come this way. Perhaps he was looking for trouble, for a fight, or maybe even for some giant to surprise him and end his pain. Drizzt skidded to a stop and blew a long and profound sigh, for what seemed most unsettling to him was not the thought that Wulfgar was inviting disaster, but his own reaction to it. For at that moment, the image of hurt Cattibrie clear in his mind, the ranger almost-almost-thought that such an ending to Wulfgar\u0027s tale would not be such a terrible thing. A call from Guenhwyvar brought him from his thoughts. He sprinted up a steep incline, leaped to another boulder, then skittered back down to another trail. He heard a growl-from Wulfgar and not the panther-then a crash as Aegis-fang slammed against some stone. The crash was near to Guenhwyvar, Drizzt realized, from the sound of the hit and the cat\u0027s ensuing protesting roars. Drizzt leaped over a stone lip, rushed across a short expanse, and jumped down a small drop to land lightly right beside the big man just as the warhammer magically reappeared in his grasp. For a moment, considering the wild look in Wulfgar\u0027s eyes, the drow thought he would have to draw his blades and fight the man, but Wulfgar calmed quickly. He seemed merely defeated, his rage thrown out. \"I did not know,\" he said, slumping back against the stone. \"I understand,\" Drizzt replied, holding back his own anger and trying to sound compassionate. \"It was not Catti-brie,\" Wulfgar went on. \"In my thoughts, I mean. I was not with her, but back there, in that place of darkness.\" \"I know,\" said Drizzt. \"And so does Catti-brie, though I fear we shall have some work ahead of us in calming Bruenor.\" He ended with a wide and warm smile, but his attempt to lighten the situation was lost on Wulfgar. \"He is right to be outraged,\" the barbarian admitted. \"As I am outraged, in a way you cannot begin to understand.\" \"Do not underestimate the value of friendship,\" Drizzt answered. \"I once made a similar error, nearly to the destruction of all that I hold dear.\" Wulfgar shook his head through every word of it, unable to find any footing for agreement. Black waves of despair washed over him, burying him. What he had done was beyond forgiveness, especially since he realized, and admitted to himself, that it would likely happen again. \"I am lost,\" he said softly. \"And we will all help you to find your way,\" Drizzt answered, putting a comforting hand on the big man\u0027s shoulder. Wulfgar pushed him away. \"No,\" he said firmly, and then he gave a little laugh. \"There is no way to find. The darkness of Errtu endures. Under that shadow, I cannot be who you want me to be.\" \"We only want you to remember who you once were,\" the drow replied. \"In the ice cave, we rejoiced to find Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, returned to us.\" \"He was not,\" the big man corrected. \"I am not the man who left you in Mithral Hall. I can never be that man again.\" \"Time will heal-\" Drizzt started to say, but Wulfgar silenced him with a roar. \"No!\" he cried. \"I do not ask for healing. I do not wish to become again the man that I was. Perhaps I have learned the truth of the world, and that truth has shown me the errors of my previous ways.\" Drizzt stared hard at the man. \"And the better way is to punch an unsuspecting Catti-brie?\" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm, his patience for the man fast running out. Wulfgar locked stares with Drizzt, and again the drow\u0027s hands went to his scimitar hilts. He could hardly believe the level of anger rising within him, overwhelming his compassion for his sorely tormented friend. He understood that if Wulfgar did try to strike at him, he would fight the man without holding back. \"I look at you now and remember that you are my friend,\" Wulfgar said, relaxing his tense posture enough to assure Drizzt that he did not mean to strike out. \"And yet those reminders come only with strong willpower. Easier it is for me to hate you, and hate everything around me, and on those occasions when I do not immediately summon the willpower to remember the truth, I will strike out.\" \"As you did with Catti-brie,\" Drizzt replied, and his tone was not accusatory, but rather showed a sincere attempt to understand and empathize. Wulfgar nodded. \"I did not even recognize that it was her,\" he said. \"It was just another of Errtu\u0027s fiends, the worst kind, the kind that tempted me and defeated my willpower, and then left me not with burns or wounds but with the weight of guilt, with the knowledge of failure. I wanted to resist....I...\" \"Enough, my friend,\" Drizzt said quietly. \"You shoulder blame where you should not. It was no failure of Wulfgar, but the unending cruelty of Errtu.\" \"It was both,\" said a defeated Wulfgar. \"And that failure compounds with every moment of weakness.\" \"We will speak with Bruenor,\" Drizzt assured him. \"We will use this incident as a guide and learn from it.\" \"You may say to Bruenor whatever you choose,\" the big man said, his tone suddenly turning ice cold once more. \"For I will not be there to hear it.\" \"You will return to your own people?\" Drizzt asked, though he knew in his heart that the barbarian wasn\u0027t saying any such thing. \"I will find whatever road I choose,\" Wulfgar replied. \"Alone.\" \"I once played this game.\" \"Game?\" the big man echoed incredulously. \"I have never been more serious in all my life. Now go back to them, back where you belong. When you think of me, think of the man I once was, the man who would never strike Catti-brie.\" Drizzt started to reply, but stopped himself and stood studying his broken friend. In truth, he had nothing to say that might comfort Wulfgar. While he wanted to believe that he and the others could help coax the man back to rational behavior, he wasn\u0027t certain of it. Not at all. Would Wulfgar strike out again, at Catti-brie, or at any of them, perhaps hurting one of them severely? Would the big man\u0027s return to the group facilitate a true fight between him and Bruenor, or between him and Drizzt? Or would Catti-brie, in self-defense, drive Khazid\u0027hea, her deadly sword, deep into the man\u0027s chest? On the surface, these fears all rang as preposterous in the drow\u0027s mind, but after watching Wulfgar carefully these past few days, he could not dismiss the troublesome possibility. And perhaps worst of all, he had to consider his own feelings when he had seen the battered Catti-brie. He hadn\u0027t been the least bit surprised. Wulfgar started away, and Drizzt instinctively grabbed him by the forearm. Wulfgar spun and threw the drow\u0027s hand aside. \"Farewell, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" he said sincerely, and those words conveyed many of his unspoken thoughts to Drizzt. A longing to go with the drow back to the group, a plea that things could be as they had once been, the friends, the companions of the hall, running down the road to adventure. And most of all, in that lucid tone, words spoken so clearly and deliberately and thoughtfully, they brought to Drizzt a sense of finality. He could not stop Wulfgar, short of hamstringing the man with a scimitar. And in his heart, at that terrible moment, he knew that he should not stop Wulfgar. \"Find yourself,\" Drizzt said, \"and then find us.\" \"Perhaps,\" was all that Wulfgar could offer. Without looking back, he walked away. For Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, the walk back to the wagon to rejoin his friends was the longest journey of his life.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-8.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
