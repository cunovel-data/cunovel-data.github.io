{"id":94489,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The man felt strange indeed. Alcohol dimmed his senses so that he could not register all the facts about his current situation. He felt light, floating, and felt a burning in his chest.\\n\\n Wulfgar clenched his fist more tightly, grasping the front of the man\u0027s tunic and pulling chest hairs from their roots in the process. With just that one arm the barbarian easily held the two hundred pound man off the ground. Using his other arm to navigate the crowd in the Cutlass, he made his way for the door. He hated taking this roundabout route previously he had merely tossed unruly drunks through a window or a wall-but Arumn Gardpeck had quickly reigned in that behavior, promising to take the cost of damages out of Wulfgar\u0027s pay.\\n\\n Even a single window could cost the barbarian a few bottles, and if the frame went with it Wulfgar might not find any drink for a week.\\n\\n The man, smiling stupidly, looked at Wulfgar and finally managed to find some focus. Recognition of the bouncer and of his present predicament at last showed on his face. \"Hey!\" he complained, but then he was flying, flat out in the air, arms and legs flailing. He landed facedown in the muddy road, and there he stayed. Likely a wagon would have run him over had not a couple of passersby taken pity on the poor slob and dragged him into the gutter ... taking the rest of his coins from him in the process.\\n\\n \"Fifteen feet,\" Josi Puddles said to Arumn, estimating the length of the drunk\u0027s flight. \"And with just one arm.\"\\n\\n \"I told ye he was a strong one,\" Arumn replied, wiping the bar and pretending that he was hardly amazed. In the weeks since the barkeep had hired Wulfgar, the barbarian had made many such throws.\\n\\n \"Every man on Half Moon Street\u0027s talking about that,\" Josi added, the tone of his voice somewhat grim. \"I been noticing that your crowd\u0027s a bit tougher every night this week.\"\\n\\n Arumn understood the perceptive man\u0027s less than subtle statement. There was a pecking order in Luskan\u0027s underbelly that resisted intrusion. As Wulfgar\u0027s reputation continued to grow, some of those higher on that pecking order would find their own reputations at stake and would filter in to mend the damage.\\n\\n \"You like the barbarian,\" Josi stated as much as asked.\\n\\n Arumn, staring hard at Wulfgar as the huge man filtered through the crowd once more, gave a resigned nod. Hiring Wulfgar had been a matter of business, not friendship, and Arumn usually took great pains to avoid any personal relationships with his bouncers- since many of those men, drifters by nature, either wandered away of their own accord or angered the wrong thug and wound up dead at Arumn\u0027s doorstep. With Wulfgar, though, the barkeep had lost some of that perspective. Their late nights together when the Cutlass was quiet, Wulfgar drinking at the bar, Arumn preparing the place for the next day\u0027s business, had become a pleasant routine. Arumn truly enjoyed Wulfgar\u0027s companionship. He discovered that once the drink was in the man, Wulfgar let down his cold and distant facade. Many nights they stayed together until the dawn, Arumn listening intently as Wulfgar wove tales of the frigid northland, of Icewind Dale, and of friends and enemies alike that made the barkeep\u0027s hair stand up on the back of his neck. Arumn had heard the story of Akar Kessel and the crystal shard so many times that he could almost picture the avalanche at Kelvin\u0027s Cairn that took down the wizard and buried the ancient and evil relic.\\n\\n And every time Wulfgar recounted tales of the dark tunnels under the dwarven kingdom of Mithral Hall and the coming of the dark elves, Arumn later found himself shivering under his blankets, as he had when he was a child and his father had told him similarly dark stories by the hearth.\\n\\n Indeed, Arumn Gardpeck had come to like his newest employee more than he should and less than he would.\\n\\n \"Then calm him,\" Josi Puddles finished. \"He\u0027ll be bringing in Morik the Rogue and Tree Block Breaker anytime soon.\"\\n\\n Arumn shuddered at the thought and didn\u0027t disagree. Particularly concerning Tree Block. Morik the Rogue, he knew, would be a bit more cautious (and thus, would be much more dangerous), would spend weeks, even months, sizing up the new threat before making his move, but brash Tree Block, arguably the toughest human-if he even was human, for many stories said that he had more than a little ore, or even ogre, blood in him-ever to step into Luskan, would not be so patient.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar,\" the barkeep called.\\n\\n The big man sifted through the crowd to stand opposite Arumn.\\n\\n \"Did ye have to throw him out?\" Arumn asked.\\n\\n \"He put his hand where it did not belong,\" Wulfgar replied absently. \"Delly wanted him gone.\"\\n\\n Arumn followed Wulfgar\u0027s gaze across the room to Delly... Delenia Curtie. Though not yet past her twentieth birthday, she had worked in the Cutlass for several years. She was a wisp of a thing, barely five feet tall and so slender that many thought she had a bit of elven blood in her-though it was more the result of drinking elven spirits, Arumn knew. Her blond hair hung untrimmed and unkempt and often not very clean. Her brown eyes had long ago lost their soft innocence and taken on a harder edge, and her pale skin had not seen enough of the sun in years, nor proper nutrition, and was now dry and rough. Her step had replaced the bounce of youth with the caution of a woman often hunted. But still there remained a charm about Delly, a sensual wickedness that many of the patrons, particularly after a few drinks, found too tempting to resist.\\n\\n \"If ye\u0027re to be killing every man who\u0027s grabbing Delly\u0027s bottom, I\u0027ll have no patrons left within the week,\" Arumn said dryly.\\n\\n \"Just push them out,\" Arumn continued when Wulfgar offered no response, not even a change of expression. \"Ye don\u0027t have to be throwing them halfway to Waterdeep.\" He motioned back to the crowd, indicating that he was done with the barbarian.\\n\\n Wulfgar walked away, back to his duties sifting through the boisterous bunch.\\n\\n Within an hour another man, bleeding from his nose and mouth, took the aerial route, this time a two-handed toss that put him almost to the other side of the street.\\n\\n Wulfgar held up his shirt, revealing the jagged line of deep scars. \"Had me up in its mouth,\" he explained grimly, slurring the words. It had taken more than a little of the potent spirits to bring him to a level of comfort where he could discuss this battle, the fight with the yochlol, the fight that had brought him to Lolth, and she to Errtu for his years of torment. \"A mouse in the cat\u0027s mouth.\" He gave a slight chuckle. \"But this mouse had a kick.\"\\n\\n His gaze drifted to Aegis-fang, lying on the bar a couple of feet away.\\n\\n \"Prettiest hammer I\u0027ve ever seen,\" remarked Josi Puddles. He reached for it tentatively, staring at Wulfgar as his hand inched in, for he, like all the others, had no desire to anger the frightfully dangerous man.\\n\\n But Wulfgar, usually very protective of Aegis-fang, his sole link to his past life, wasn\u0027t even watching. His recounting of the yochlol fight had sent his thoughts and his heart careening back across the years, had locked him into a replay of the events that had put him in living hell.\\n\\n \"And how it hurt,\" he said softly, voice quavering, one hand subconsciously running the length of the scar.\\n\\n Arumn Gardpeck stood before him staring, but though Wulfgar\u0027s eyes aimed at those of the barkeep, their focus was far, far away. Arumn slid another drink before the man, but Wulfgar didn\u0027t notice. With a deep and profound sigh the barbarian dropped his head into his huge arms, seeking the comfort of blackness.\\n\\n He felt a touch on his bare arm, gentle and soft, and turned his head so that he could regard Delly. She nodded to Arumn, then gently pulled Wulfgar, coaxing him to rise and leading him away.\\n\\n Wulfgar awoke later that night, long and slanted rays of moonlight filtering into the room through the western window. It took him a few moments to orient himself and to realize that this was not his room, for his room had no windows.\\n\\n He glanced around and then to the blankets beside him, to the lithe form of Delly amidst those blankets, her skin seeming soft and delicate in the flattering light.\\n\\n Then he remembered. Delly had taken him from the bar to bed-not to his own, but to hers-and he remembered all they had done.\\n\\n Fearful, recalling his less-than-tender parting with Catti-brie, Wulfgar gently reached over and put his hand about the woman\u0027s neck, sighing in profound relief to find that she still had a pulse. Then he turned her over and scanned her bare body, not in any lustful way, but merely to see if she showed any bruises, any signs that he had brutalized her.\\n\\n Her sleep was quiet and sound.\\n\\n Wulfgar turned to the side of the bed, rolling his legs off the edge. He started to stand, but his throbbing head nearly knocked him backward. Reeling, he fought to control his balance and then ambled over to the window, staring out at the setting moon.\\n\\n Catti-brie was likely watching that same moon, he thought, and somehow knew it to be true. After a while he turned to regard Delly again, all soft and snuggled amidst mounds of blankets. He had been able to make love to her without the anger, without the memories of the succubi balling his fists in rage. For a moment he felt as if he might be free, felt as if he should burst out of the house, out of Luskan altogether, running down the road in search of his old friends. He looked back at the moon and thought of Catti-brie and how wonderful it would be to fall into her arms.\\n\\n But then he realized the truth of it all.\\n\\n The drink had allowed him to build a wall against those memories, and behind that protective barrier he had been able to live in the present and not the past.\\n\\n \"Come on back to bed,\" came Belly\u0027s voice behind him, a gentle coax with a subtle promise of sensual pleasure. \"And don\u0027t you be worrying over your hammer,\" she added, turning so that Wulfgar could follow her gaze to the opposite wall, against which Aegis-fang rested.\\n\\n Wulfgar spent a long moment regarding the woman, caretaker of his emotions and his possessions. She was sitting up, the covers bundled about her waist, and making no move to cover her nakedness. Indeed she seemed to flaunt it a bit to entice the man back into her bed,\\n\\n A large part of Wulfgar did want to go to her. But he resisted, realizing the danger, realizing that the drink had worn off. In a fit of passion, a fit of remembered rage, how easy it would be for him to squeeze her bird-like neck.\\n\\n \"Later,\" he promised, moving to gather his clothes. \"Before we go to work this night.\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t have to leave.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" he said briskly, and he saw the flash of pain across her face. He moved to her immediately, very close. \"I do,\" he repeated in a softer tone. \"But I will come back to you. Later.\"\\n\\n He kissed her gently on the forehead and started for the door.\\n\\n \"You are thinking that I\u0027ll want you back,\" came a harsh call behind him, and he turned to see Delly staring at him, her gaze ice cold, her arms folded defensively across her chest.\\n\\n At first surprised, Wulfgar only then realized that he wasn\u0027t the only one in this room carrying around personal demons.\\n\\n \"Go,\" Delly said to him. \"Maybe I\u0027ll take you back, and maybe I\u0027ll find another. All the same to me.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar sighed and shook his head, then pushed out into the hall, more than happy to be out of that room.\\n\\n The sun peeked over the eastern rim before the barbarian, an empty bottle at his side, found his way back into the void of sleep. He didn\u0027t see the sunrise, though, for his room had no windows.\\n\\n He preferred it that way.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-15.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
