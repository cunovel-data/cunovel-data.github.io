{"id":94494,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Part 4 KINGDOMS\\n\\n Whether a king\u0027s palace, a warrior\u0027s bastion, a wizard\u0027s tower, an encampment for nomadic barbarians, a farmhouse with stone-lined or hedge-lined fields, or even a tiny and unremarkable room up the back staircase of a ramshackle inn, we each of us spend great energy in carving out our own little kingdoms. From the grandest castle to the smallest nook, from the arrogance of nobility to the unpretentious desires of the lowliest peasant, there is a basic need within the majority of us for ownership, or at least for stewardship. We want to-need to-find our realm, our place in a world often too confusing and too overwhelming, our sense of order in one little corner of a world that oft looms too big and too uncontrollable.\\n\\n And so we carve and line, fence and lock, then protect our space fiercely with sword or pitchfork.\\n\\n The hope is that this will be the end of that road we chose to walk, the peaceful and secure rewards for a life of trials. Yet, it never comes to that, for peace is not a place, whether lined by hedges or by high walls. The greatest king with the largest army in the most invulnerable fortress is not necessarily a man at peace. Far from it, for the irony of it all is that the acquisition of such material wealth can work against any hope of true serenity. But beyond any physical securities there lies yet another form of unrest, one that neither the king nor the peasant will escape. Even that great king, even the simplest beggar will, at times, be full of the unspeakable anger we all sometimes feel. And I do not mean a rage so great that it cannot be verbalized but rather a frustration so elusive and permeating that one can find no words for it. It is the quiet source of irrational outbursts against friends and family, the perpetrator of temper. True freedom from it cannot be found in any place outside one\u0027s own mind and soul.\\n\\n Bruenor carved out his kingdom in Mithral Hall, yet found no peace there. He preferred to return to Icewind Dale, a place he had named home not out of desire for wealth, nor out of any inherited kingdom, but because there, in the frozen northland, Bruenor had come to know his greatest measure of inner peace. There he surrounded himself with friends, myself among them, and though he will not admit this-I am not certain he even recognizes it-his return to Icewind Dale was, in fact, precipitated by his desire to return to that emotional place and time when he and I, Regis, Catti-brie, and yes, even Wulfgar, were together. Bruenor went back in search of a memory.\\n\\n I suspect that Wulfgar now has found a place along or at the end of his chosen road, a niche, be it a tavern in Luskan or Waterdeep, a borrowed barn in a farming village, or even a cave in the Spine of the World. Because what Wulfgar does not now have is a clear picture of where he emotionally wishes to be, a safe haven to which he can escape. If he finds it again, if he can get past the turmoil of his most jarring memories, then likely he, too, will return to Icewind Dale in search of his soul\u0027s true home.\\n\\n In Menzoberranzan I witnessed many of the little kingdoms we foolishly cherish, houses strong and powerful and barricaded from enemies in a futile attempt at security. And when I walked out of Menzoberranzan into the wild Underdark, I, too, sought to carve out my niche. I spent time in a cave talking only to Guenhwyvar and\\n\\n sharing space with mushroomlike creatures that I hardly understood and who hardly understood me. I ventured to Blingdenstone, city of the deep gnomes, and could have made that my home, perhaps, except that staying there, so close to the city of drow, would have surely brought ruin upon those folk.\\n\\n And so I came to the surface and found a home with Montolio deBrouchee in his wondrous mountain grove, perhaps the first place I ever came to know any real measure of inner peace. And yet I came to learn that the grove was not my home, for when Montolio died I found to my surprise that I could not remain there.\\n\\n Eventually I found my place and found that the place was within me, not about me. It happened when I came to Icewind Dale, when I met Catti-brie and Regis and Bruenor. Only then did I learn to defeat the unspeakable anger within. Only there did I learn true peace and serenity.\\n\\n Now I take that calm with me, whether my friends accompany me or not. Mine is a kingdom of the heart and soul, defended by the security of honest love and friendship and the warmth of memories. Better than any land-based kingdom, stronger than any castle wall, and most importantly of all, portable.\\n\\n I can only hope and pray that Wulfgar will eventually walk out of his darkness and come to this same emotional place.\\n\\n Chapter 19 CONCERNING WULFGAR\\n\\n Delly pulled her coat tighter about her, more trying to hide her gender than to fend off any chill breezes. She moved quickly along the street, skipping fast to try and keep up with the shadowy figure turning corners ahead of her, a man one of the other patrons of the Cutlass had assured her was indeed Morik the Rogue, no doubt come on another spying mission.\\n\\n She turned into an alleyway, and there he was. He was standing right before her, waiting for her, dagger in hand.\\n\\n Delly skidded to a stop, hands up in a desperate plea for her life. \"Please Mister Morik!\" she cried. \"I\u0027m just wantin\u0027 to talk to ye.\"\\n\\n \"Morik?\" the man echoed, and his hood slipped back revealing a dark-skinned face-too dark for the man Delly sought.\\n\\n \"Oh, but I\u0027m begging yer pardon, good sir,\" Delly stammered, backing away. \"I was thinking ye were someone else.\" The man started to respond, but Delly hardly heard him, for she turned about and sprinted back toward the Cutlass.\\n\\n When she got safely away, she calmed and slowed enough to consider the situation. Ever since the fight with Tree Block Breaker, she and many other patrons had seen Morik the Rogue in every shadow, had heard him skulking about every corner. Or had they all, in their fears, just thought they had seen the dangerous man? Frustrated by that thought, knowing that there was indeed more than a little truth to her reasoning, Delly gave a great sigh and let her coat droop open.\\n\\n \"Selling your wares, then, Delly Curtie?\" came a question from the side.\\n\\n Belly\u0027s eyes widened as she turned to regard the shadowy figure against the wall, the figure belonging to a voice she recognized. She felt the lump grow in her throat. She had been looking for Morik, but now that he had found her on his terms she felt foolish indeed. She glanced down the street, back toward the Cutlass, wondering if she could make it there before a dagger found her back.\\n\\n \"You have been asking about me and looking for me,\" Morik casually remarked. \"I\u0027ve been doing no such-\"\\n\\n \"I was one of those whom you asked,\" Morik interrupted dryly. His voice changed pitch and accent completely as he added, \"So be tellin\u0027 me, missy, why ye\u0027re wantin\u0027 to be seein\u0027 that nasty little knife-thrower.\"\\n\\n That set Delly back on her heels, remembering well her encounter with an old woman who had said those very words in that very voice. And even if she hadn\u0027t recognized the phrasing or the voice, she wouldn\u0027t for a moment doubt the man who was well-known as Luskan\u0027s master of disguise. She had seen Morik on several occasions, intimately, many months before. Every time he had appeared differently to her, not just in physical features but in demeanor and attitude as well, walking differently, talking differently, even making love differently. Rumors circulating through Luskan for years had claimed that Morik was, in fact, several different men, and while Delly thought them exaggerated, she realized just then that if they turned out to be correct, she wouldn\u0027t be surprised.\\n\\n \"So you have found me,\" Morik said firmly.\\n\\n Delly paused, not sure how to proceed. Only Morik\u0027s obvious agitation and impatience prompted her to blurt out, \"I\u0027m wanting ye to leave Wulfgar alone. He gave Tree Block what Tree Block asked for and wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve gone after the man if the man didn\u0027t go after him.\"\\n\\n \"Why would I care for Tree Block Breaker?\" Morik asked, still using a tone that seemed to say that he had hardly given it a thought. \"An irritating thug, if ever I knew one. Half Moon Street seems a better place without him.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then ye\u0027re not for avenging that one,\" Delly reasoned. \"But word\u0027s out that ye\u0027re none too fond o\u0027 Wulfgar and looking to prove-\"\\n\\n \"I have nothing to prove,\" Morik interrupted.\\n\\n \"And what of Wulfgar then?\" Delly asked.\\n\\n Morik shrugged noncommittally. \"You speak as if you love the man, Delly Curtie.\"\\n\\n Delly blushed fiercely. \"I\u0027m speaking for Arumn Gardpeck, as well,\" she insisted. \"Wulfgar\u0027s been good for the Cutlass, and as far as we\u0027re knowing, he\u0027s been not a bit o\u0027 trouble outside the place.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, but it seems as if you do love him, Delly, and more than a bit,\" Morik said with a laugh. \"And here I thought that Delly Curtie loved every man equally.\"\\n\\n Delly blushed again, even more fiercely.\\n\\n \"Of course, if you do love him, then I, out of obligation to all other suitors, would have to see him dead,\" Morik reasoned. \"I would consider that a duty to my fellows of Luskan, you see, for a treasure such as Delly Curtie is not to be hoarded by any one man.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not loving him,\" Delly said firmly. \"But I\u0027m asking ye, for meself and for Arumn, not to kill him.\"\\n\\n \"Not in love with him?\" Morik asked slyly.\\n\\n Delly shook her head.\\n\\n \"Prove it,\" Morik said, reaching out to pull the tie string on the neck of Dolly\u0027s dress.\\n\\n The woman teetered for just a moment, unsure. And then for Wulfgar only, for she did not wish to do this-she nodded her agreement.\\n\\n Later on, Morik the Rogue lay alone in his rented bed, Delly long gone-to Wulfgar\u0027s bed, he figured. He took a deep draw on his pipe, savoring the intoxicating aroma of the exotic and potent pipeweed.\\n\\n He considered his good fortune this night, for he hadn\u0027t been with Delly Curtie in more than a year and had forgotten how marvelous she could be.\\n\\n Especially when it didn\u0027t cost him anything, and on this nigh, it most certainly had not. Morik had indeed been watching Wulfgar but had no intention of killing the man. The fate of Tree Block Breaker had shown him well how dangerous a proposition that attempt could prove.\\n\\n He did plan to have a long talk with Arumn Gardpeck, though, one that Delly would surely make easier now. There was no need to kill the barbarian, as long as Arumn kept the huge man in his place.\\n\\n Delly fumbled with her dress and cloak, all in a fit after her encounter with Morik, as she stumbled through the upstairs rooms of the inn. She turned a corner in the hallway and was surprised indeed to see the street looming in front of her, right in front of her, and before she could even stop herself, she was outside. And then the world was spinning all about.\\n\\n When she at last re-oriented herself, she glanced back behind her, seeing the open street under the moonlight, and the inn where she had left Morik many yards away. She didn\u0027t understand, for hadn\u0027t she been walking inside just a moment ago? And in an upstairs hallway? Delly merely shrugged. For this woman, not understanding something was not so uncommon an occurrence. She shook her head, figured that Morik had really set her thoughts to spinning that night, and headed back for the Cutlass.\\n\\n On the other side of the dimensional door that had transported the woman out of the inn, Kimmuriel Oblodra almost laughed aloud at the bumbling spectacle. Glad of his camouflaging piwafwi cloak, for Jarlaxle had insisted that he leave no traces of his ever being in Luskan, and Jarlaxle considered murdered humans as traces, the drow turned the corner in the hallway and lined up his next spatial leap.\\n\\n He winced at the notion, reminding himself that he had to handle this one delicately; he and Rai\u0027gy had done some fine spying on Morik the Rogue, and Kimmuriel knew the man to be dangerous, for a human, at least. He brought up his kinetic barrier, focused all his thoughts on it, then enacted the dimensional path down the corridor and beyond Morik\u0027s door.\\n\\n There lay the man on his bed, bathed in the soft glow of his pipe and the embers from the hearth across the room. Morik sat up immediately, obviously sensing the disturbance, and Kimmuriel went through the portal, focusing his thoughts more strongly on the kinetic barrier. If the disorientation of the spatial walk defeated his concentration, he would likely be dead before his thoughts ever unscrambled.\\n\\n Indeed, the drow felt Morik come into him hard, felt the jab of a dagger against his belly. But the kinetic barrier held, and he absorbed the blow. As he found again his conscious focus and took two more hits, he pushed back against the man and wriggled out to the side, standing facing Morik and laughing at him.\\n\\n \"You can not hurt me,\" he said haltingly, his command of the common tongue less than perfect, even with the magics Rai\u0027gy had bestowed upon him.\\n\\n Morik\u0027s eyes widened considerably as he recognized the truth of the intruder, as his mind came to grips with the fact that a drow elf had come into his room. He glanced about, apparently seeking an escape route.\\n\\n \"I come to talk, Morik,\" Kimmuriel explained, not wanting to have to chase this one all across Luskan. \"Not to hurt you.\"\\n\\n Morik hardly seemed to relax at the assurance of a dark elf.\\n\\n \"I bring gifts,\" Kimmuriel went on, and he tossed a small box onto the bed, its contents jingling. \"Belaern, and pipeweed from the great cavern of Yoganith. Very good. You must answer questions.\"\\n\\n \"Questions about what?\" the still nervous thief asked, remaining in his defensive crouch, one hand turning his dagger over repeatedly. \"Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"My master is...\" Kimmuriel paused, searching for the right word. \"Generous,\" he decided. \"And my master is merciless. You deal with us.\" He stopped there and held up his hand to halt any reply before Morik could respond. Kimmuriel felt the energy tingling within him, and holding it had become a drain he could ill afford. He focused on a small chair, sending his thoughts into it, animating it and having it walk right past him.\\n\\n He touched it as it crossed before him, releasing all the energy of Morik\u0027s hits, shattering the wooden chair completely.\\n\\n Morik eyed him skeptically, without comprehension. \"A warning?\" he asked.\\n\\n Kimmuriel only smiled.\\n\\n \"You did not like my chair?\"\\n\\n \"My master wishes to hire you,\" Kimmuriel explained. \"He needs eyes in Luskan.\"\\n\\n \"Eyes and a sword?\" Morik asked, his own eyes narrowing.\\n\\n \"Eyes and no more,\" Kimmuriel came back. \"You tell me of the one called Wulfgar now, and then you will watch him closely and tell me about him when occasions have me return to you.\"\\n\\n \"Wulfgar?\" Morik muttered under his breath, fast growing tired of the name.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar,\" answered Kimmuriel, who shouldn\u0027t have been able to hear, but of course, with his keen drow ears, certainly did. \"You watch him.\"\\n\\n \"I would rather kill him,\" Morik remarked. \"If he is trouble-\" He stopped abruptly as murderous intent flashed across Kimmuriel\u0027s dark eyes.\\n\\n \"Not that,\" the drow explained. \"Kyorlin ... watch him. Quietly. I return with more belaern for more answers.\" He motioned to the box on the bed and repeated the drow word, \"Belaern,\" with great emphasis.\\n\\n Before Morik could ask anything else the room darkened utterly, a blackness so complete that the man couldn\u0027t see his hand if he had waved it an inch before his eyes. Fearing an attack, he went lower and skittered forward, dagger slashing.\\n\\n But the dark elf was long gone, was back through his dimensional door into the hallway, then through that onto the street, then back through Rai\u0027gy\u0027s teleportation gate, walking all that way back to Calimport before the globe of darkness even dissipated in Morik\u0027s room. Rai\u0027gy and Jarlaxle, both of whom had watched the exchange, nodded their approval.\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s grasp on the surface world widened.\\n\\n Morik came out from under his bed tentatively when the embers of the hearth at last reappeared. What a strange night it had been! he thought. First with Delly, though that was not so unexpected, since she obviously loved Wulfgar and knew that Morik could easily kill him.\\n\\n But now ... a drow elf! Coming to Morik to talk about Wulfgar! Was everything on Luskan\u0027s street suddenly about Wulfgar? Who was this man, and why did he attract such amazing attention?\\n\\n Morik looked at the blasted chair-an impressive feat then, frustrated, threw his dagger across the room so that it sank deep into the opposite wall. Then he went to the bed.\\n\\n \"Belaern,\" he said quietly, wondering what that might mean. Hadn\u0027t the dark elf said something about pipeweed?\\n\\n He gingerly inspected the unremarkable box, looking for any traps. Finding none and reasoning that the dark elf could have used a more straightforward method of killing him if that had been the drow\u0027s intent, he set the box solidly on a night table and gently pulled its latch back and opened the lid.\\n\\n Gems and gold stared back at him, and packets of a dark weed.\\n\\n \"Belaern,\" Morik said again, his smile gleaming as did the treasure before him. So he was to watch Wulfgar, something he had planned to do anyway, and he would be rewarded handsomely for his efforts.\\n\\n He thought of Delly Curtie; he looked at the contents of the opened box and the rumpled sheets.\\n\\n Not a bad night.\\n\\n Life at the Cutlass remained quiet and peaceful for several days, with no one coming in to challenge Wulfgar after the demise of the legendary Tree Block Breaker. But when the peace finally broke, it did so in grand fashion. A new ship put in to Luskan harbor with a crew too long on the water and looking for a good row.\\n\\n And they found one in the form of Wulfgar, in a tavern they nearly pulled down around them.\\n\\n Finally, after many minutes of brawling, Wulfgar lifted the last squirming sailor over his head and tossed the man out through the hole in the wall created by the four previous men the barbarian had thrown out. Another stubborn sea dog tried to rush back in through the hole, and Wulfgar hit him in the face with a bottle.\\n\\n Then the big man wiped a bloody forearm across his bloody face, took up another bottle-this one fall-and staggered to the nearest intact table. Falling into a chair and taking a deep swig, Wulfgar grimaced as he drank, as the alcohol washed over his torn lip.\\n\\n At the bar, Josi and Arumn sat exhausted and also beaten. Wulfgar had taken the brunt of it, though; these two had minor cuts and bruises only.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s hurt pretty bad,\" Josi remarked, motioning to the big man-to his leg in particular, for Wulfgar\u0027s pants were soaked in blood. One of the sailors had struck him hard with a plank. The board had split apart and torn fabric and skin, leaving many large slivers deeply embedded in the barbarian\u0027s leg.\\n\\n Even as Arumn and Josi regarded him, Delly moved beside him, falling to her knees and wrapping a clean cloth about the leg. She pushed hard on the deep slivers and made Wulfgar growl in agony. He took another deep drink of the pain killing liquor.\\n\\n \"Delly will see to him again,\" Arumn remarked. \"That\u0027s become her lot in life.\"\\n\\n \"A busy lot, then,\" Josi agreed, his tone solemn. \"I\u0027m thinking that the last crew Wulfgar dumped, Rossie Doone and his thugs, probably pointed this bunch in our direction. There\u0027ll always be another to challenge the boy.\"\\n\\n \"And one day he will find his better. As did Tree Block Breaker,\" Arumn said quietly. \"He\u0027ll not die comfortably in bed, I fear.\"\\n\\n \"Nor will he outlive either of us,\" Josi added, watching as Delly, supporting the barbarian, led him out of the room.\\n\\n Just then another pair of rowdy sailors came rushing through the broken wall, running straight for the staggering Wulfgar\u0027s back. Just before they got to him, the huge barbarian found a surge of energy. He pushed Delly safely away, then spun, fist flying between the reaching arms of one man to slam him in the face. He dropped as though his legs had turned to liquid beneath him.\\n\\n The other sailor barreled into Wulfgar, but the big man didn\u0027t move an inch, just grunted and accepted the man\u0027s left and right combination.\\n\\n But then Wulfgar had him, grabbing tight under his arms and squeezing hard, lifting the man right from the floor. When the sailor tried to punch and kick at him, the barbarian shook him so violently that the man bit the tip right off his tongue.\\n\\n Then he was flying, Wulfgar taking two running steps and launching him for the hole in the wall.\\n\\n Wulfgar\u0027s aim wasn\u0027t true, though, and the man crashed against the wall a foot or so to the left.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll push him out for ye,\" Josi Puddles called from the bar.\\n\\n Wulfgar nodded, accepted Delly\u0027s arm again, and ambled away.\\n\\n \"But he will take his share down with him, now won\u0027t he?\" Arumn Gardpeck remarked with a chuckle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-20.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
