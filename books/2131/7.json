{"id":94481,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Drizzt watched every move the barbarian made-the way Wulfgar sat opposite him across the fire, the way the man went at his dinner-looking for some hint of the barbarian\u0027s mindset. Had the battle with the giants helped? Had Drizzt \"run the horse\" as he had explained his hopes to Regis? Or was Wulfgar in worse shape now than before the battle? Was he more consumed by this latest guilt, though his actions, or inaction, hadn\u0027t really cost them anything?\\n\\n Wulfgar had to recognize that he had not performed well at the beginning of the battle, but had he, in his own mind, made up for that error with his subsequent actions?\\n\\n Drizzt was as perceptive to such emotions as anyone alive, but, in truth, he could not get the slightest read of the barbarian\u0027s inner turmoil. Wulfgar moved methodically, mechanically, as he had since his return from Errtu\u0027s clutches, going through the motions of life itself without any outward sign of pain, satisfaction, relief, or anything else. Wulfgar was existing, but hardly living. If there remained a flicker of passion within those sky-blue orbs, Drizzt could not see it.\\n\\n Thus, the drow ranger was left with the impression that the battle with the giants had been inconsequential, had neither bolstered the barbarian\u0027s desire to live nor had placed any further burdens upon Wulfgar. In looking at his friend now, the man tearing a piece of fowl from the bone, his expression unchanging and un-revealing, Drizzt had to admit to himself that he had not only run out of answers but out of places to look for answers.\\n\\n Catti-brie moved over and sat down beside Wulfgar then, and the barbarian did pause to regard her. He even managed a little smile for her benefit. Perhaps she might succeed where he had failed, the drow thought. He and Wulfgar had been friends, to be sure, but the barbarian and Catti-brie had shared something much deeper than that.\\n\\n The thought of it brought a tumult of opposing feelings into Drizzt\u0027s gut. On the one hand he cared deeply for Wulfgar and wanted nothing more in all the world than for the barbarian to heal his emotional scars. On the other hand, seeing Catti-brie close to the man pained him. He tried to deny it, tried to elevate himself above it, but it was there, and it was a fact, and it would not go away.\\n\\n He was jealous.\\n\\n With great effort, the drow sublimated those feelings enough to honestly leave the couple alone. He went to join Bruenor and Regis and couldn\u0027t help but contrast the halfling\u0027s beaming face as he devoured his third helping with that of Wulfgar, who seemed to be eating only to keep his body alive. Pragmatism against pure pleasure.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll be out o\u0027 the dale tomorrow,\" Bruenor was saying, pointing out the dark silhouettes of the mountains, looming much larger to the south and east. Indeed, the wagon had turned the corner and they were heading south now, no longer west. The wind, which always filled the ears in Icewind Dale, had died to the occasional gust.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s me boy?\" Bruenor asked when he noticed the dark elf.\\n\\n Drizzt shrugged.\\n\\n \"Ye could\u0027ve got him killed, ye durned fool elf,\" the dwarf huffed. \"Ye could\u0027ve got us all killed. And not for the first time!\"\\n\\n \"And not for the last,\" Drizzt promised with a smile, bowing low. He knew that Bruenor was playing with him here, that the dwarf loved a good fight as much as he did, particularly one against giants. Bruenor had been upset with him, to be sure, but only because Drizzt hadn\u0027t included him in the original battle plans. The brief but brutal fight had long since exorcised that grudge from Bruenor, and so now he was just teasing the drow as a means of relieving his honest concerns for Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"Did ye see his face when we battled?\" the dwarf asked more earnestly. \"Did ye see him when Rumblebelly showed up with his stinkin\u0027 giant friend and it appeared as if me boy was about to be squished flat?\"\\n\\n Drizzt admitted that he did not. \"I was engaged with my own concerns at the time,\" he explained. \"And with Guenhwyvar\u0027s peril.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Bruenor declared. \"Nothing at all. No anger as he lifted his hammer to throw it at the giants.\"\\n\\n \"The warrior sublimates his anger to keep in conscious control,\" the drow reasoned.\\n\\n \"Bah, not like that,\" Bruenor retorted. \"I saw rage in me boy when we fought Errtu on the ice island, rage beyond anything me old eyes\u0027ve ever seen. And how I\u0027d like to be seein\u0027 it again. Anger, rage, even fear!\"\\n\\n \"I saw him when I arrived at the battle,\" Regis admitted. \"He did not know that the new and huge giant would be an ally, and if it was not, if it had joined in on the side of the other giants, then Wulfgar would have easily been killed, for he had no defense against our angle from his open ledge. And yet he was not afraid at all. He looked right up at the giant, and all I saw was...\"\\n\\n \"Resignation,\" the drow finished for him. \"Acceptance of whatever fate might throw at him.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not for understanding.\" Bruenor admitted.\\n\\n Drizzt had no answers for him. He had his suspicions, of course, that Wulfgar\u0027s trauma had been too great and had thus stolen from him his hopes and dreams, his passions and purpose, but he could find no way to put that into words that the ever-pragmatic dwarf might understand. He thought it ironic, in a sense, for the closest example of similar behavior he could recall was Bruenor\u0027s own, soon after Wulfgar had fallen to the yochlol. The dwarf had wandered aimlessly through the halls for days on end, grieving.\\n\\n Yes, Drizzt realized, that was the key word. Wulfgar was grieving.\\n\\n Bruenor would never understand, and Drizzt wasn\u0027t sure that he understood.\\n\\n \"Time to go,\" Regis remarked, drawing the dark elf from his contemplation. Drizzt looked to the halfling, then to Bruenor.\\n\\n \"Camlaine\u0027s invited us to a game o\u0027 bones,\" Bruenor explained. \"Come along, elf. Yer eyes see better\u0027n most, and I might be needing ye.\"\\n\\n Drizzt glanced back to the fire, to Wulfgar and Cattibrie, sitting very close and talking. He noted that Cattibrie wasn\u0027t doing all of the speaking. She had somehow engaged Wulfgar, even had him a bit animated in his discussion. A big part of Drizzt wanted to stay right there and watch their every move, but he wouldn\u0027t give in to that weakness, so he went with Bruenor and Regis to watch the game of bones.\\n\\n \"Ye cannot know our pain at seeing the ceiling fall in on ye,\" Catti-brie said, gently moving the conversation to that fateful day in the bowels of Mithral Hall. Up to now, she and Wulfgar had been sharing happier memories of previous fights, battles in which the companions had overwhelmed monsters and put down threats without so high a price.\\n\\n Wulfgar had even joined in, telling of his first battle with Bruenor-against Bruenor-when he had broken his standard staff over the dwarf\u0027s head, only to have the stubborn little creature swipe his legs out from under him and leave him unconscious on the field. As the conversation wound on, Catti-brie focused on another pivotal event: the Grafting of Aegis-fang. What a labor of love that had been, the pinnacle of Bruenor\u0027s amazing career as a smith, done purely out of the dwarf\u0027s affection for Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"If he hadn\u0027t loved ye so, he\u0027d ne\u0027er been able to make so great a weapon,\" she had explained. When she saw that her words were getting through to the pained man she had shifted the conversation subtly again, to the reverential treatment Bruenor had shown the warhammer after Wulfgar\u0027s apparent demise. And that, of course, had brought Catti-brie to the discussion of the day of Wulfgar\u0027s fall, to the memory of the evil yochlol.\\n\\n To her great relief, Wulfgar had not tightened up when she went in this direction, but had stayed with her, hearing her words and adding his own when they seemed relevant.\\n\\n \"All the strength went from me body,\" Catti-brie went on. \"And never have I seen Bruenor closer to breaking. But we went on and started fighting in yer name, and woe to our enemies then.\"\\n\\n A distant look came into Wulfgar\u0027s light eyes and the woman went silent, giving him time to digest her words. She thought he would respond, but he did not, and the seconds slipped away quietly.\\n\\n Catti-brie moved closer to him and put her arm about his back, resting her head on his strong shoulder. He didn\u0027t push her away, even shifted so they would both be more comfortable. The woman had hoped for more, had hoped to get Wulfgar into an emotional release. But while she hadn\u0027t achieved quite that, she recognized that she had gotten more than she could have rightfully expected. The love had not resurfaced, but neither had the rage.\\n\\n It would take time.\\n\\n The group did indeed roll out of Icewind Dale the next morning, a distinction made clear by the shifting wind. In the dale, the wind came from the northeast, rolling down off the cold waters of the Sea of Moving Ice. At the juncture to points south, east, and north of the bulk of the mountains, the wind blew constantly no longer, but was more a matter of gusts than the incessant whistle through the dale. And now, moving more to the south, the wind again kicked up, swirling against the towering Spine of the World. Unlike the cold breeze that gave its name to Icewind Dale, this was a gentle blow. The winds wafted up from warmer climes to the south or off the warmer waters of the Sword Coast, hitting against the blocking mountains and swirling back.\\n\\n Drizzt and Bruenor spent most of the day away from the wagon, both to scout a perimeter about the steady but slow pacing team and to give some privacy to Catti-brie and Wulfgar. The woman was still talking, still trying to bring the man to a better place and time. Regis rode all the day long nestled in the back of the wagon among the generous-smelling foodstuffs.\\n\\n It proved to be a quiet and uneventful day of travel, except for one point where Drizzt found a particularly disturbing track, that of a huge, booted giant.\\n\\n \"Rumblebelly\u0027s friend?\" Bruenor asked, bending low beside the ranger as he inspected the footprint.\\n\\n \"So I would guess,\" Drizzt replied.\\n\\n \"Durned halfling put more of a spell than he should\u0027ve on the thing,\" Bruenor grumbled.\\n\\n Drizzt, who understood the power of the ruby pendant and the nature of enchantments in general, could not agree. He knew that the giant, no stupid creature, had been released from any spell Regis had woven soon after leaving the group. Likely, before they were miles apart, the giant had begun to wonder why in the world he had ever deigned to help the halfling and his strange group of friends. Then, soon after that, he had either forgotten the whole incident or was angry indeed at having been so deceived.\\n\\n And now the behemoth seemed to be shadowing them, Drizzt realized, noting the general course of the tracks.\\n\\n Perhaps it was mere coincidence, or perhaps even a different giant-Icewind Dale had no shortage of giants, after all. Drizzt could not be sure, and so, when he and Bruenor returned to the group for their evening meal, they said nothing about the footprints or about increasing the night watch. Drizzt did go off on his own, though, as much to get away from the continuing scene between Catti-brie and Wulfgar as to scout for any rogue giants. There in the dark of night, he could be alone with his thoughts and his fears, could wage his own emotional wars and remind himself over and over that Catti-brie alone could decide the course of her life.\\n\\n Every time he recalled an incident highlighting how intelligent and honest the woman had always been, he was comforted. When the full moon began its lazy ascent over the distant waters of the Sword Coast, the drow felt strangely warm. Though he could hardly see the glow of the campfire, he understood that he was truly among friends.\\n\\n Wulfgar looked deeply into her blue eyes and knew that she had purposefully brought him to this point, had smoothed the jagged edges of his battered consciousness slowly and deliberately, had massaged the walls of anger until her gentle touch had rubbed them into transparency. And now she wanted, she demanded, to look behind those walls, wanted to see the demons that so tormented Wulfgar.\\n\\n Catti-brie sat quietly, calmly, patiently waiting. She had coaxed some specific horror stories out of the man and then had probed deeper, had asked him to lay bare his soul and his terror, something she knew could not be easy for the proud and strong man.\\n\\n But Wulfgar hadn\u0027t rebuffed her. He sat now, his thoughts whirling, his gaze locked firmly by hers, his breath coming in gasps, his heart pounding in his huge chest.\\n\\n \"For so long I held on to you,\" he said quietly. \"Down there, among the smoke and the dirt, I held fast to an image of my Catti-brie. I kept it right before me at all times. I did.\"\\n\\n He paused to catch his breath, and Catti-brie placed a gentle hand on his.\\n\\n \"So many sights that a man was not meant to view,\" Wulfgar said quietly, and Catti-brie saw a hint of moisture in his light eyes. \"But I fought them all with an image of you.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie offered a smile, but that did little to comfort Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"He used it against me,\" the man went on, his tone lowering, becoming almost a growl. \"Errtu knew my thoughts and turned them against me. He showed me the finish of the yochlol fight, the creature pushing through the rubble, falling over you and tearing you to pieces. Then it went for Bruenor....\"\\n\\n \"Was it not the yochlol that brought you to the lower planes?\" Catti-brie asked, trying to use logic to break the demonic spell.\\n\\n \"I do not remember,\" Wulfgar admitted. \"I remember the fall of the stones, the pain of the yochlol\u0027s bite tearing into my chest, and then only blackness until I awakened in the court of the Spider Queen.\\n\\n \"But even that image ... you do not understand! The one thing I could hold onto Errtu perverted and turned against me. The one hope left in my heart burned away and left me empty.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie moved closer, her face barely an inch from Wulfgar\u0027s. \"But hope rekindles,\" she said softly. \"Errtu is gone, banished for a hundred years, and the Spider Queen and her hellish drow minions have shown no interest in Drizzt for years. That road has ended, it seems, and so many new ones lie before us. The road to the Spirit Soaring and Cadderly. From there to Mithral Hall perhaps, and then, if we choose, we might go to Waterdeep and Captain Deudermont, take a wild voyage on Sea Sprite, cutting the waves and chasing pirates.\\n\\n \"What possibilities lie before us!\" she went on, her smile wide, her blue eyes flashing with excitement. \"But first we must make peace with our past.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar heard her well, but he only shook his head, reminding her that it might not be as easy as she made it sound. \"For all those years you thought I was dead,\" he said. \"And so I thought of you for that time. I thought you killed, and Bruenor killed, and Drizzt cut apart on the altar of some vile drow matron. I surrendered hope because there was none.\"\\n\\n \"But you see the lie,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"There is always hope, there must always be hope. That is the lie of Errtu\u0027s evil kind. The lie about them, and the lie that is them. They steal hope, because without hope there is no strength. Without hope there is no freedom. In slavery of the heart does a demon find its greatest pleasures.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar took a deep, deep breath, trying to digest it all, balancing the logical truths of Catti-brie\u0027s words- and of the simple fact that he had indeed escaped Errtu\u0027s clutches-against the pervasive pain of memory.\\n\\n Catti-brie, too, spent a long moment digesting all that Wulfgar had shown to her over the past days. She understood now that it was more than pain and horror that bound her friend. Only one emotion could so cripple a man. In replaying his memories within his own mind, Wulfgar had found some wherein he had surrendered, wherein he had given in to the desires of Errtu or the demon\u0027s minions, wherein he had lost his courage or his defiance. Yes, it was obvious to Cattibrie, staring hard at the man now that guilt above all else was the enduring demon of Wulfgar\u0027s time with Errtu.\\n\\n Of course to her that seemed absurd. She could readily forgive anything Wulfgar had said or done to survive the decadence of the Abyss. Anything at all. But it was not absurd, she quickly reminded herself, for it was painted clearly on the big man\u0027s pained features.\\n\\n Wulfgar squinted his eyes shut and gritted his teeth. She was right, he told himself repeatedly. The past was past, an experience dismissed, a lesson learned. Now they were all together again, healthy and on the road of adventure. Now he had learned the errors of his previous engagement to Cattibrie and could look at her with fresh hopes and desires.\\n\\n She recognized a measure of calm come over the man as he opened his eyes again to stare back at her. And then he came forward, kissing her softly, just brushing his lips against hers as if asking permission.\\n\\n Catti-brie glanced all around and saw that they were indeed alone. Though the others were not so far away, those who were not asleep were too engaged in their gambling to take note of anything.\\n\\n Wulfgar kissed her again, a bit more urgently, forcing her to consider her feelings for the man. Did she love him? As a friend, surely, but was she ready to take that love to a different level?\\n\\n Catti-brie honestly did not know. Once she had decided to give her love to Wulfgar, to marry him and bear his children, to make her life with him. But that was so many years ago, a different time, a different place. Now she had feelings for another, perhaps, though in truth, she hadn\u0027t really examined those feelings any deeper than she had her current feelings for Wulfgar.\\n\\n And she hadn\u0027t the time to examine them now, for Wulfgar kissed her again passionately. When she didn\u0027t respond in kind, he backed off to arms\u0027 length, staring at her hard.\\n\\n Looking at him then, on the brink of disaster, on a precipice between past and future, Catti-brie came to understand that she had to give this to him. She pulled him back and initiated another kiss, and they embraced deeply, Wulfgar guiding her to the ground, rolling about, touching, caressing, fumbling with their clothes.\\n\\n She let him lose himself in the passion, let him lead with touches and kisses, and she took comfort in the role she had accepted, took hope that their encounter this night would help bring Wulfgar back to the world of the living.\\n\\n And it was working. Wulfgar knew it, felt it. He bared his heart and soul to her, threw away his defenses, basked in the feel of her, in the sweet smell of her, in the very softness of her.\\n\\n He was free! For those first few moments he was free, and it was glorious and beautiful, and so real.\\n\\n He rolled to his back, his strong hug rolling Catti-brie atop him. He bit softly on the nape of her neck, then, nearing a point of ecstasy, leaned his head back so that he could look into her eyes and share the moment of joy.\\n\\n A leering succubus, vile temptress of the Abyss, stared back at him.\\n\\n Wulfgar\u0027s thoughts careened back across Icewind Dale, back to the Sea of Moving Ice, to the ice cave and the fight with Errtu, then back beyond that, back to the swirling smoke and the horrors. It had all been a lie, he realized. The fight, the escape, the rejoining with his friends. All a lie perpetrated by Errtu to rekindle his hope that the demon could then snuff it out once again. All a lie, and he was still in the Abyss, dreaming of Catti-brie while entwining with a horrid succubus.\\n\\n His powerful hand clamped under the creature\u0027s chin and pushed it away. His second hand came across in a vicious punch and then he lifted the beast into the air above his prone form and heaved it away, bouncing across the dirt. With a roar, Wulfgar pulled himself to his feet, fumbling to lift and straighten his pants. He staggered for the fire and, ignoring the pain, reached in to grab a burning branch, then turned back to attack the wicked succubus.\\n\\n Turned back to attack Catti-brie.\\n\\n He recognized her then, half-undressed, staggering to her hands and knees, blood dripping freely from her nose. She managed to look up at him. There was no rage, only confusion on her battered face. The weight of guilt nearly buckled the barbarian\u0027s strong legs.\\n\\n \"I did not . . .\" he stammered. \"Never would I ...\" With a gasp and a stifled cry, Wulfgar rushed across the campsite, tossing the burning stick aside, gathering up his pack and warhammer. He ran out into the dark of night, into the ultimate darkness of his tormented mind. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-7.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
