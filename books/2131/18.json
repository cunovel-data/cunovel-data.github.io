{"id":94492,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"There was indeed something appealing about the fighting, about the feeling of superiority and the element of control. Between the fact that the fights were not lethal-though more than a few patrons were badly injured-and the conscience- dulling drinks, no guilt accompanied each thunderous punch.\\n\\n Just satisfaction and control, an edge that had been too long absent.\\n\\n Had he stopped to think about it, Wulfgar might have realized that he was substituting each new challenger for one particular nemesis, one he could not defeat alone, one who had tormented him all those years.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t bother with contemplation, though. He simply enjoyed the sensation of his fist colliding with the chest of this latest troublemaker, sending the tall, thin man reeling back in a hopping, staggering, stumbling quickstep, finally to fall backward over a bench some twenty feet from the barbarian.\\n\\n Wulfgar methodically waded in, grabbing the decked man by the collar (and taking out more than a few chest hairs in the process) and the groin (and similarly extracting hair). With one jerk the barbarian brought the horizontal man level with his waist. Then a rolling motion snapped the man up high over his head.\\n\\n \"I just fixed that window,\" Arumn Gardpeck said dryly, helplessly, seeing the barbarian\u0027s aim.\\n\\n The man flew through it to bounce across Half Moon Street.\\n\\n \"Then fix it again,\" Wulfgar replied, casting a glare over Arumn that the barkeep did not dare to question.\\n\\n Arumn just shook his head and went back to wiping his bar, reminding himself that, by keeping such complete order in the place Wulfgar was attracting customers-many of them. Folk now came looking for a safe haven in which to waste a night, and then there were those interested in the awesome displays of power. These came both as challengers to the mighty barbarian or, more often, merely as spectators. Never had the Cutlass seen so many patrons, and never had Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s purse been so full.\\n\\n But how much more full it would be, he knew, if he didn\u0027t have to keep fixing the place.\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t\u0027ve done that,\" a man near the bar remarked to Arumn. \"That\u0027s Rossie Doone, he throwed, a soldier.\"\\n\\n \"Not wearing any uniform,\" Arumn remarked.\\n\\n \"Came in unofficial,\" the man explained. \"Wanted to see this Wulfgar thug.\"\\n\\n \"He saw him,\" Arumn replied in the same resigned and dry tones.\\n\\n \"And he\u0027ll be seein\u0027 him again,\" the man promised. \"Only next time with friends.\"\\n\\n Arumn sighed and shook his head, not out of any fear for Wulfgar, but because of the expenses he anticipated if a whole crew of soldiers came in to fight the barbarian.\\n\\n Wulfgar spent that night-half the night-in Delly Curtie\u0027s room again, taking a bottle with him from the bar, then grabbing another one on his way outside. He went down to the docks and sat on the edge of a long wharf, watching the sparkles grow on the water as the sun rose behind him.\\n\\n Josi Puddles saw them first, entering the Cutlass the very next night, a half-dozen grim-faced men including the one the patron had identified as Rossie Doone. They moved to the far side of the room, evicting several patrons from tables, then pulling three of the benches together so they could all sit side by side with their backs to the wall.\\n\\n \"Full moon tonight,\" Josi remarked.\\n\\n Arumn knew what that meant. Every time the moon was full the crowd was a bit rowdier. And what a crowd had come in this evening, every sort of rogue and thug Arumn could imagine.\\n\\n \"Been the talk of the street all the day,\" Josi said quietly.\\n\\n \"The moon?\" Arumn asked.\\n\\n \"Not the moon,\" Josi replied. \"Wulfgar and that Rossie fellow. All have been talking of a coming brawl.\"\\n\\n \"Six against one,\" Arumn remarked.\\n\\n \"Poor soldiers,\" Josi said with a snicker.\\n\\n Arumn nodded to the side then, to Wulfgar, who, sitting with a foaming mug in hand, seemed well aware of the group that had come in. The look on the barbarian\u0027s face, so calm and yet so cold, sent a shiver along Arumn\u0027s spine. It was going to be a long night.\\n\\n On the other side of the room, in a corner opposite where sat the six soldiers, another man, quiet and unassuming, also noted the tension and the prospective combatants with more than a passing interest. The man\u0027s name was well known on the streets of Luskan, though his face was not. He was a shadow stalker by trade, a man cloaked in secrecy, but a man whose reputation brought trembles to the hardiest of thugs.\\n\\n Morik the Rogue had been hearing quite a bit about Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s new strong-arm; too much, in fact. Story after story had come to him about the man\u0027s incredible feats of strength. About how he had been hit squarely in the face with a heavy club and had shaken it away seemingly without care. About how he lifted two men high into the air, smashed their heads together, then simultaneously tossed them through opposite walls of the tavern. About how he had thrown one man out into the street, then rushed out and blocked a team of two horses with his bare chest to stop the wagon from running down the prone drunk. . . .\\n\\n Morik had been living among the street people long enough to understand the exaggerated nonsense in most of these tales. Each storyteller tried to outdo the previous one. But he couldn\u0027t deny the impressive stature of this man Wulfgar. Nor could he deny the many wounds showing about the head of Rossie Doone, a soldier Morik knew well and whom he had always respected as a solid fighter.\\n\\n Of course Morik, his ears so attuned to the streets and alleyways, had heard of Rossie\u0027s intention to return with his friends and settle the score. Of course Morik had also heard of another\u0027s intention to put this newcomer squarely in his place. And so Morik had come in to watch, and nothing more, to measure this huge northerner, to see if he had the strength, the skills, and the temperament to survive and become a true threat.\\n\\n Never taking his gaze off Wulfgar, the quiet man sipped his wine and waited.\\n\\n As soon as he saw Delly moving near to the six men, Wulfgar drained his beer in a single swallow and tightened his grip on the table. He saw it coming, and how predictable it was, as one of Rossie Doone\u0027s sidekicks reached out and grabbed Delly\u0027s bottom as she moved past.\\n\\n Wulfgar came up in a rush, storming in right before the offender, and right beside Delly.\\n\\n \"Oh, but \u0027tis nothing,\" the woman said, pooh-poohing Wulfgar away. He grabbed her by the shoulders, lifted her, and turned, depositing her behind him. He turned back, glaring at the offender, then at Rossie Doone, the true perpetrator.\\n\\n Rossie remained seated, laughing still, seeming completely relaxed with three burly fighters on his right, two more on his left.\\n\\n \"A bit of fun,\" Wulfgar stated. \"A cloth to cover your wounds, deepest of all the wound to your pride.\"\\n\\n Rossie stopped laughing and stared hard at the man.\\n\\n \"We have not yet fixed the window,\" Wulfgar said. \"Do you prefer to leave by that route once more?\"\\n\\n The man next to Rossie bristled, but Rossie held him back. \"In truth, northman, I prefer to stay,\" he answered. \"In my own eyes it\u0027s yourself who should be leaving.\"\\n\\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t blink. \"I ask you a second time, and a last time, to leave of your own accord,\" he said.\\n\\n The man farthest from Rossie, down to Wulfgar\u0027s left, stood up and stretched languidly. \"Think I\u0027ll get me a bit o\u0027 drink,\" he said calmly to the man seated beside him, and then, as if going to the bar, he took a step Wulfgar\u0027s way.\\n\\n The barbarian, already a seasoned veteran of barroom brawls, saw it coming. He understood that the man would grab at him to hold and slow him so that Rossie and the others could pummel him. He kept his apparent focus directly on Rossie and waited. Then, as the man came within two steps, as his hands started coming up to grab at Wulfgar, the barbarian spun suddenly, stepping inside the other\u0027s reach. The barbarian snapped his back muscles, launching his forehead into the man\u0027s face, crushing his nose and sending him staggering backward.\\n\\n Wulfgar turned back fast, fist flying, and caught Rossie across the jaw as he started to rise, slamming the man back against the wall. Hardly slowing, Wulfgar grabbed the stunned Rossie by the shoulders and yanked him hard to the side, flipping him to the left to deflect the coming rush of the two men remaining there. Then around went the barbarian again, growling, fists flying, to swap heavy punches with the two men leaping at him from that direction.\\n\\n A knee came up for his groin, but Wulfgar recognized the move and reacted fast. He turned his leg in to catch the blow with his thigh, then reached down under the bent leg. The attacker instinctively grabbed at Wulfgar, catching shoulder and hair, trying to use him for balance. But the powerful barbarian, simply too strong, drove on, heaving him up and over his shoulder, turning as he went to again deflect the attack from the two men coming in at his back.\\n\\n The movement cost Wulfgar several punches from the man who had been standing next to the latest human missile. Wulfgar accepted them stoically, hardly seeming to care. He came back hard, legs pumping, to drive the puncher into the wall, wrestling him around.\\n\\n The desperate soldier grabbed on with all his strength, and the man\u0027s friends fast approached from behind. A roar, a wriggle, and a stunning punch extracted Wulfgar from the man\u0027s grasp. He skittered back away from the wall and the pursuers, instinctively ducking a punch as he went and grabbing a table by the leg.\\n\\n Wulfgar spun back, facing the group, and halted the swinging momentum of the table so fully that the item snapped apart. The bulk of the table flew into the chest of the closest man, leaving Wulfgar standing with a wooden table leg in hand, a club he wasted no time in putting to good use. The barbarian smacked it below the table at the exposed legs of the man he had hit with the missile, cracking the side of the soldier\u0027s knee once and then again. The man howled in pain and shoved the table back out at Wulfgar, but he accepted the missile strike with merely a shrug, concentrating instead on turning the club in line and jabbing the man in the eye with its narrow end.\\n\\n A half turn and full swing caught another across the side of the head, splitting the club apart and dropping the attacker like a sack of ground meal. Wulfgar ran right over him as he fell-the barbarian understood that mobility was his only defense against so many. He barreled into the next man in line, carrying him halfway across the room to slam into a wall, a journey that ended with a wild flurry of fists from both. Wulfgar took a dozen blows and gave a like number, but his were by far the heavier, and the dazed and defeated man crumbled to the floor-or would have, had not Wulfgar grabbed him as he slumped. The barbarian turned about fast and let his latest human missile fly, spinning him in low across the ankles of the closest pursuer, who tripped headlong, both arms reaching out to grab the barbarian. Wulfgar, still in his turn, using the momentum of that spin, dived forward, punch leading, stretching right between those arms. His force combined with the momentum of the stumbling man, and he felt his fist sink deep into the man\u0027s face, snapping his head back violently.\\n\\n That man, too, went down hard.\\n\\n Wulfgar stood straight, facing Rossie and his one standing ally, who had blood rolling freely from his nose. Another man holding his torn eye tried to stand beside them, but his broken knee wouldn\u0027t support his weight. He stumbled away to the side to slam into a wall and sink there into a sitting position.\\n\\n In the first truly coordinated attack since the chaos had begun, Rossie and his companion came in slow and then leaped together atop Wulfgar, thinking to bear him down. But though the two were both large men, Wulfgar didn\u0027t fall, didn\u0027t stumble in the least. The barbarian caught them as they soared in and held his footing. His thrashing had them both holding on for dear life. Rossie slipped away, and Wulfgar managed to get both arms on the other, dragging the clutching man horizontally across in front of his face. The man\u0027s arms flailed about Wulfgar\u0027s head, but the angle of attack was all wrong, and the blows proved ineffectual.\\n\\n Wulfgar roared again and bit the man\u0027s stomach hard, then started a full-out, blind run across the tavern floor. Gauging the distance, Wulfgar dipped his head at the last moment to put his powerful neck muscles in proper alignment, then rammed full force into the wall. He bounced back, holding the man with just one arm hooked under his shoulder, and kept it there long enough to allow the man to come down on his feet.\\n\\n The man stood, against the wall, watching in confusion as Wulfgar ran back a few steps, and then his eyes widened indeed when the huge barbarian turned about, roared, and charged, dipping his shoulder as he came.\\n\\n The man put his arms up, but that hardly mattered, for Wulfgar shoulder-drove him against the planking- right into the planking, which cracked apart. Louder than the splitting wood came the sound of a groan and a sigh from resigned Arumn Gardpeck.\\n\\n Wulfgar bounced back again but leaned in fast, slamming left and right repeatedly, each thunderous blow driving the man deeper into the wall. The poor man, crumbled and bloody, splinters deep in his back, his nose already broken and half his body feeling the same way, held up a feeble arm to show that he had had enough.\\n\\n Wulfgar smashed him again, a vicious left hook that came in over the upraised arm and shattered his jaw, throwing him into oblivion. He would have fallen except that the broken wall held him fast in place.\\n\\n Wulfgar didn\u0027t even notice, for he had turned around to face Rossie, the lone enemy still showing any ability to fight. One of the others, the man Wulfgar had traded blows with against the wall, crawled about on hands and knees, seeming as if he didn\u0027t even know where he was. Another, the side of his head split wide by the vicious club swing, kept trying to stand and kept falling over, while a third still sat against the wall, clutching his torn eye and broken knee. The fourth of Rossie\u0027s companions, the one Wulfgar had hit with the single, devastating punch, lay very still with no sign of consciousness.\\n\\n \"Gather your friends and be gone,\" a tired Wulfgar offered to Rossie. \"And do not return.\"\\n\\n In answer, the outraged man reached down to his boot and drew out a long knife. \"But I want to play,\" Rossie said wickedly, approaching a step.\\n\\n \"Wulfgar!\" came Belly\u0027s cry from across the way, from behind the bar, and both Wulfgar and Rossie turned to see the woman throwing Aegis-fang out toward her friend, though she couldn\u0027t get the heavy warhammer half the distance.\\n\\n That hardly mattered, though, for Wulfgar reached for it with his arm and with his mind, telepathically calling to the hammer.\\n\\n The hammer vanished, then reappeared in the barbarian\u0027s waiting grasp. \"So do I,\" Wulfgar said to an astonished and horrified Rossie. To accentuate his point, he swung Aegisfang, one armed, out behind him. The swing hit and split a beam, which drew another profound groan from Arumn.\\n\\n Rossie, his eager expression long gone, glanced about and backed away liked a trapped animal. He wanted to back out, to find some way to flee-that much was apparent to everybody in the room.\\n\\n And then the outside door banged open, turning all heads-those that weren\u0027t broken open-Rossie Doone\u0027s and Wulfgar\u0027s included, and in strode the largest human, if he was indeed a human, that Wulfgar had ever seen. He was a giant man, taller than Wulfgar by a foot at least, and almost as wide, weighing perhaps twice the barbarian\u0027s three hundred pounds. Even more impressive was the fact that very little of the giant\u0027s bulk jiggled as he stormed in. He was all muscle, and gristle, and bone.\\n\\n He stopped inside the suddenly hushed tavern, his huge head turning slowly to scan the room. His gaze finally settled on Wulfgar. He brought his arms out slowly from under the front folds of his cloak to reveal that he held a heavy length of chain in one hand and a spiked club in the other.\\n\\n \"Ye too tired for me, Wulfgar the dead?\" Tree Block Breaker asked, spittle flying with each word. He finished with a growl, then brought his arm across powerfully, slamming the length of chain across the top of the nearest table and splitting the thing neatly down the middle. The three patrons sitting at that particular table didn\u0027t scamper away. They didn\u0027t dare to move at all.\\n\\n A smile widened across Wulfgar\u0027s face. He flipped Aegis-fang into the air, a single spin, to catch it again by the handle.\\n\\n Arumn Gardpeck groaned all the louder; this would be an expensive night.\\n\\n Rossie Doone and those of his friends who could still move scrambled across the room, out of harm\u0027s way, leaving the path between Wulfgar and Tree Block Breaker clear.\\n\\n In the shadows across the room, Morik the Rogue took another sip of wine. This was the fight he had come to see.\\n\\n \"Well, ye give me no answer,\" Tree Block Breaker said, whipping his chain across again. This time it did not connect solidly but whipped about one angled leg of the fallen table. Then, after slapping the leg of one sitting man, its tip got a hold on the man\u0027s chair. With a great roar, Tree Block yanked the chain back, sending table and chair flying across the room and dropping the unfortunate patron on his bum.\\n\\n \"Tavern etiquette and my employer require that I give you the opportunity to leave quietly,\" Wulfgar calmly replied, reciting Arumn\u0027s creed.\\n\\n On came Tree Block Breaker, a great, roaring monster, a giant gone wild. His chain flailed back and forth before him, his club raised high to strike.\\n\\n Wulfgar realized that he could have taken the giant out with a well-aimed throw of Aegis-fang before Tree\\n\\n Block had gone two steps, but he let the creature come on, relishing the challenge. To everyone\u0027s surprise he dropped Aegis-fang to the floor as Tree Block closed. When the chain swished for his head, he dropped into a sudden squat but held his arm vertically above him.\\n\\n The chain hooked around, and Wulfgar reached over it and grabbed on, giving a great tug that only increased Tree Block\u0027s charge. The huge man swung with his club, but he was too close and still coming. Wulfgar went down low, driving his shoulder against the man\u0027s legs. Tree Block\u0027s momentum carried his bulk across the bent barbarian\u0027s back.\\n\\n Amazingly, stunningly, Wulfgar stood up straight, bringing Tree Block up above him. Then, to the astonished gasps of all watching, he bent at the knees quickly and jerked back up straight. Pushing with all his strength, he lifted Tree Block into the air above his head.\\n\\n Before the huge man could wriggle about and bring his club to bear, Wulfgar ran back the way Tree Block had charged, and with a great roar of his own, threw the man right through the door, taking it and the jamb out completely and depositing the huge man in a jumble of kindling outside the Cutlass. His arm still enwrapped by the chain, Wulfgar gave a huge tug that sent Tree Block spinning about in the pile of wood before he surrendered the chain altogether.\\n\\n The stubborn giant thrashed about, finally extricating himself from the wood heap. He stood roaring, his face and neck cut in a dozen places, his club whirling about wildly.\\n\\n \"Turn and leave,\" Wulfgar warned. The barbarian reached behind him and with a thought brought Aegis-fang back to his hand.\\n\\n If Tree Block even heard the warning, he showed no indication. He smacked his club against the ground and came forward in a rush, snarling.\\n\\n And then he was dead. Just like that, caught by surprise as the barbarian\u0027s arm came forward, as the mighty warhammer twirled out, too fast for his attempted deflection with the club, too powerfully for Tree Block\u0027s massive chest to absorb the hit.\\n\\n He stumbled backward and went down with more a whisper than a bang and lay very still.\\n\\n Tree Block Breaker was the first man Wulfgar had killed in his tenure at Arumn Gardpeck\u0027s bar, the first man killed in the Cutlass in many, many months. All the tavern, Delly and Josi, Rossie Doone and his thugs, seemed to stop in pure amazement. The place went perfectly silent.\\n\\n Wulfgar, Aegis-fang returned to his grasp, calmly turned about and walked over to the bar, paying no heed to the dangerous Rossie Doone. He placed Aegis-fang on the bar before Arumn, indicating that the bar-keep should replace it on the shelves behind the counter, then casually remarked, \"You should fix the door, Arumn, and quickly, else someone walks in and steals your stock.\"\\n\\n And then, as if nothing had happened, Wulfgar walked back across the room, seemingly oblivious to the silence and the open-mouthed stares that followed his every stride.\\n\\n Arumn Gardpeck shook his head and lifted the warhammer, then stopped as a shadowy figure came up opposite him.\\n\\n \"A fine warrior you have there, Master Gardpeck,\" the man said. Arumn recognized the voice, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up.\\n\\n \"And Half Moon Street is a better place without that bully Tree Block running about,\" Morik went on. \"I\u0027ll not lament his demise.\"\\n\\n \"I have never asked for any quarrel,\" Arumn said. \"Not with Tree Block and not with you.\"\\n\\n \"Nor will you find one,\" Morik assured the innkeeper as Wulfgar, noting the conversation, came up beside the man-as did Josi Puddles and Delly, though they kept a more respectful distance from the dangerous rogue.\\n\\n \"Well fought, Wulfgar, son of Beornegar,\" Morik said. He slid a glass of drink along the bar before Wulfgar, who looked down at it, then back at Morik suspiciously. After all, how could Morik know his full name, one he had not used since his entry into Luskan, one that he had purposely left far, far behind.\\n\\n Delly slipped in between the two, calling for Arumn to fetch her a couple of drinks for other patrons, and while the two stood staring at each other, she slyly swapped the drink Morik had placed with one from her tray. Then she moved out of the way, rolling back behind Wulfgar, wanting the security of his massive form between her and the dangerous man.\\n\\n \"Nor will you find one,\" Morik said again to Arumn. He tapped his forehead in salute and walked away, out of the Cutlass.\\n\\n Wulfgar eyed him curiously, recognizing the balanced gait of a warrior, then moved to follow, pausing only long enough to lift and drain the glass.\\n\\n \"Morik the Rogue,\" Josi Puddles remarked to Arumn and Delly, moving opposite the barkeep. Both he and Arumn noted that Delly was holding the glass Morik had offered to Wulfgar.\\n\\n \"And likely this\u0027d kill a fair-sized minotaur,\" she said, reaching over to dump the contents into a basin.\\n\\n Despite Morik\u0027s assurances, Arumn Gardpeck did not disagree. Wulfgar had solidified his reputation a hundred times over this night, first by absolutely humbling Rossie Doone and his crowd-there would be no more trouble from them and then by downing-and oh, so easily-the toughest fighter Half Moon Street had known in years.\\n\\n But with such fame came danger, all three knew. To be in the eyes of Morik the Rogue was to be in the sights of his deadly weapons. Perhaps the man would keep his promise and let things lay low for a time, but eventually Wulfgar\u0027s reputation would grow to become a distraction, and then, perhaps, a threat.\\n\\n Wulfgar seemed oblivious to it all. He finished his night\u0027s work with hardly another word, not even to Rossie Doone and his companions, who chose to stay- mostly because several of them needed quite a bit of potent drink to dull the pain of their wounds-but quietly so. And then, as was his growing custom, he took two bottles of potent liquor, took Delly by the arm, and retired to her room for half the night.\\n\\n When that half a night had passed he, the remaining bottle in hand, went to the docks to watch the reflection of the sunrise.\\n\\n To bask in the present, care nothing about the future, and forget the past. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-18.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) \\n Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
