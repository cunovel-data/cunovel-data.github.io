{"id":94490,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"The prow cut swiftly through the azure blanket of the Sword Coast, shooting great fins of water and launching spray high into the air. At the forward rail, Catti-brie felt the stinging, salty droplets, so cold in contrast to the heat of the brilliant sun on her fair face. The ship, Quester, sailed south, and so south the woman looked. Away from Icewind Dale, away from Luskan, away from Waterdeep, from which they had sailed three days previous. Away from Wulfgar. Not for the first time, and she knew not for the last, the woman reconsidered their decision to let the beleaguered barbarian go off on his own. In his present state of mind, a state of absolute tumult and confusion, how could Wulfgar not need them? And yet she had no way to get to him now, sailing south along the Sword Coast. Catti-brie blinked away moisture that was not sea spray and set her gaze firmly on the wide waters before them, taking some heart at the sheer speed of the vessel. They had a mission to complete, a vital mission, for during their days crossing by land they had come to learn beyond doubt that Crenshinibon remained a potent foe, sentient and intelligent. It was able to call in creatures to serve as its minions, monsters of dark heart eager to grasp at the promises of the relic. Thus the friends had gone to Waterdeep and had taken passage on the sturdiest available ship in the harbor, believing that enemies would be fewer at sea and far easier to discern. Both Drizzt and Catti-brie greatly lamented that Captain Deudermont and his wondrous Sea Sprite were not in. Less than two hours out from port one of the crewmen had come after Drizzt, thinking to steal the crystal. Battered by the flat sides of flashing twin scimitars, the man, bound and gagged, had been handed off to another ship passing by, heading to the north to Waterdeep, with instructions to turn him over to the dock authorities in that lawful city for proper punishment. Since then, though, the voyage had been uneventful, just swift sailing and empty waters, flat horizons dotted rarely by the sails of another distant ship. Drizzt moved to join Catti-brie at the rail. Though she didn\u0027t turn around, she knew by the footsteps that followed the near-silent drow that Bruenor and Regis had come too. \"Only a few more days to Baldur\u0027s Gate,\" the drow said. Catti-brie glanced over at him, noting that he kept the cowl of his traveling cloak low over his face-not to block any of the stinging spray, she knew, for Drizzt loved that feel as much as she, but to keep him in comfortable shade. Drizzt and Catti-brie had spent years together aboard Deudermont\u0027s Sea Sprite, and still the high sun of midday glittering off the waters bothered the drow elf, whose heritage had designed him for walking lightless caverns. \"How fares Bruenor?\" the woman asked quietly, pretending not to know that the dwarf was standing behind her. \"Grumbling for solid ground and all the enemies in the world to stand against him, if necessary, to get him off this cursed floating coffin,\" the ranger replied, playing along. Catti-brie managed a slight grin, not surprised at all. She had journeyed the seas with Bruenor farther to the south. While the dwarf had kept a stoic front on that occasion, his relief had been obvious when they had at last docked and returned again to solid ground. This time Bruenor was having an even worse time of it, spending long stretches at the rail-and not for the view. \"Regis seems unbothered,\" Drizzt went on. \"He makes certain that no food remains on Bruenor\u0027s plate soon after Bruenor declares that he cannot eat.\" Another smile found its way onto Catti-brie\u0027s face. Again it was short-lived. \"Do ye think we\u0027ll be seeing him again?\" she asked. Drizzt sighed and turned his gaze out to the empty waters. Though they were both looking south, the wrong direction, they were both, in a manner of speaking, looking for Wulfgar. It was as if, against all logic and reason, they expected the man to come swimming toward them. \"I do not know,\" the drow admitted. \"In his mood, it is possible that Wulfgar has found many enemies and has flung himself against them with all his heart. No doubt many of them are dead, but the north is a place of countless foes, some, I fear, too powerful even for Wulfgar.\" \"Bah!\" Bruenor snorted from behind. \"We\u0027ll find me boy, don\u0027t ye doubt. And the worst foe he\u0027ll be seeing\u0027ll be meself, paying him back for slapping me girl and for bringing me so much worry!\" \"We shall find him,\" Regis declared. \"And Lady Alustriel will help, and so will the Harpells.\" The mention of the Harpells brought a groan from Bruenor. The Harpells were a family of eccentric wizards known for blowing themselves and their friends up, turning themselves quite by accident and without repair-into various animals and all other manner of self-inflicted catastrophes. \"Alustriel, then,\" Regis agreed. \"She will help if we cannot find him on our own.\" \"Bah! And how tough\u0027re ye thinking that to be?\" Bruenor argued. \"Are ye knowin\u0027 many rampaging seven-footers then? And them carrying hammers that can knock down a giant or the house it\u0027s living in with one throw?\" \"There,\" Drizzt said to Catti-brie. \"Our assurances that we will indeed find our friend.\" The woman managed another smile, but it, too, was a strained thing and could not last. And what would they find when they at last located their missing friend? Even if he was physically unharmed, would he wish to see them? And even if he did, would he be in a better humor? And most important of all, would they- would she-really wish to see him? Wulfgar had hurt Catti-brie badly, not in body, but in heart, when he had struck her. She could forgive him that, she knew, to some extent at least. But only once. She studied her drow friend, saw his shadowed profile under the edge of his cowl as he stared vacantly to the empty waters, his lavender eyes glazed, as if his mind were looking elsewhere. She turned to consider Bruenor and Regis then and found them similarly distracted. All of them wanted to find Wulfgar again-not the Wulfgar who had left them on the road but the one who had left them those years ago in the tunnels beneath Mithral Hall, taken by the yochlol. They all wanted it to be as it had once been, the Companions of the Hall adventuring together without the company of brooding internal demons. \"A sail to the south,\" Drizzt remarked, drawing the woman from her contemplation. Even as Catti-brie looked out from the rail, squinting in a futile attempt to spot the too distant ship, she heard the cry from the crow\u0027s nest confirming the drow\u0027s claim. \"What\u0027s her course?\" Captain Vaines called from somewhere near the middle of the deck. \"North,\" Drizzt answered quietly so that only Catti-brie, Bruenor, and Regis could hear. \"North,\" cried the crewman from the crow\u0027s nest a few seconds later. \"Yer eyes\u0027ve improved in the sunlight,\" Bruenor remarked. \"Credit Deudermont,\" Catti-brie explained. \"My eyes,\" Drizzt added, \"and my perceptions of intent.\" \"What\u0027re ye babbling about?\" Bruenor asked, but the ranger held up his hand, motioning for silence. He stood staring intently at the distant ship whose sails now appeared to the other three as tiny black dots, barely above the horizon. \"Go and tell Captain Vaines to turn us to the west,\" Drizzt instructed Regis. The halfling stood staring for just a moment, then rushed back to find Vaines. Just a minute or so later the friends felt the pull as Quester leaned and turned her prow to the left. \"Ye\u0027re just making the trip longer,\" Bruenor started to complain, but again Drizzt held up his hand. \"She is turning with us, keeping her course to intercept,\" the drow explained. \"Pirates?\" Catti-brie asked, a question echoed by Captain Vaines as he moved up to join the others. \"They are not in trouble, for they cut the water as swiftly as we, perhaps even more so,\" Drizzt reasoned. \"Nor are they a ship of a king\u0027s fleet, for they fly no standard, and we are too far out for any coastal patrollers.\" \"Pirates,\" Captain Vaines spat distastefully. \"How can ye know all that?\" an unconvinced Bruenor demanded. \"Comes from hunting \u0027em,\" Catti-brie explained. \"And we\u0027ve hunted more than our share.\" \"So I heard in Waterdeep,\" said Vaines, which was why he had agreed to take them aboard for a swift run to Baldur\u0027s Gate in the first place. Normally a woman, a dwarf, and a halfling would find no easy-and surely no cheap-passage out of Waterdeep Harbor when accompanied by a dark elf, but among the honest sailors of Waterdeep the names Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and Catti-brie rang out as sweet music. The approaching ship showed bigger on the horizon now, but it was still too small for any detailed images-except to Drizzt, and to Captain Vaines and the man in the crow\u0027s nest, both holding rare and expensive spyglasses. The captain put his to his eye now and recognized the telltale triangular sails. \"She\u0027s a schooner,\" he said. \"And a light one. She cannot hold more than twenty or so and is no match for us.\" Catti-brie considered the words carefully. Quester was a caravel, and a large one at that. She held three strong banks of sails and had a front end long and tapered to aid in her run, but she carried a pair of ballistae, and had thick and strong sides. A slender schooner did not seem much of a match for Quester, to be sure, but how many pirates had said the same about another schooner, Deudermont\u0027s Sea Sprite, only to wind up fast filling with sea water? \"Back to the south with us!\" the captain called, and Quester creaked and leaned to the right. Soon enough, the approaching schooner corrected her course to maintain her intercepting route. \u0027Too far to the north,\" Vaines remarked, striking a pensive pose, one hand coming up to stroke the gray hairs of his beard. \"Pirates should not be this far north and should not deign to approach us.\" The others, particularly Drizzt and Catti-brie, understood his trepidation. Concerning brute force at least, the schooner and her crew of twenty, perhaps thirty, would seem no match for the sixty of Vaines\u0027s crew. But such odds could often be overcome at sea by use of a single wizard, Catti-brie and Drizzt both knew. They had seen Sea Sprite\u0027s wizard, a powerful invoker named Robillard, take down more than one ship single-handedly long before conventional weapons had even been used. \"Shouldn\u0027t and aren\u0027t ain\u0027t the same word,\" Bruenor remarked dryly. \"I\u0027m not knowing if they\u0027re pirates or not, but they\u0027re coming, to be sure.\" Vaines nodded and moved back to the wheel with his navigator. \"I\u0027ll get me bow and go up to the nest,\" Catti-brie offered. \"Pick your shots well,\" Drizzt replied. \"Likely there is one, or maybe a couple, who are guiding this ship. If you can find them and down them, the rest might flee.\" \"Is that the way of pirates?\" Regis asked, seeming more than a little confused. \"If they even are pirates?\" \"That is the way of a lesser ship coming after us because of the crystal shard,\" Drizzt replied, and then the other two caught on. \"Ye\u0027re thinking the damned thing\u0027s calling them?\" Bruenor asked. \"Pirates take few chances,\" Drizzt explained. \"A light schooner coming after Quester is taking a great chance.\" \"Unless they got wizards,\" Bruenor reasoned, for he, too, had understood Captain Vaines\u0027s concerns. Drizzt was shaking his head before the dwarf ever finished. Catti-brie would have been, too, except that she had already run off to retrieve Taulmaril. \"A pirate running with enough magical aid to destroy Quester would have long ago been marked,\" the drow explained. \"We would have heard of her and been warned of her before we ever left Waterdeep.\" \"Unless she is new to the trade or new of the power,\" Regis reasoned. Drizzt conceded the point with a nod, but he remained unconvinced, believing that Crenshinibon had brought this new enemy in, as it had brought in so many others in a desperate attempt to wrest the relic away from those who would see it destroyed. The drow looked back across the deck, spotting the familiar form of Catti-brie with Taulmaril, the wondrous Heart-seeker, strapped across her back as she made her nimble way up the knotted rope. Then he opened his belt pouch and gazed upon the wicked relic, Crenshinibon. How he wished he could hear its call to better understand the enemies it would bring before them. Quester shuddered suddenly as one of its great ballistae let fly. The huge spear leaped away, skipping a couple times across the water far short of the out-of-range schooner, but close enough to let the sailors aboard her recognize that Quester had no intention of parlay or surrender. But the schooner flew on without the slightest course change, splitting the water right beside the spent ballista bolt, even clipping the metal-tipped spear as it hung buoy like in the swelling sea. Smooth and swift was its run, seeming more like an arrow cutting the air than a ship cutting the water. The narrow hull had been built purely for speed. Drizzt had seen pirates such as this; often similar ships had led Sea Sprite, also a schooner, but a three-master and much larger, on long pursuits. The drow had enjoyed those chases most of all during his time with Deudermont, sails full of wind, spray rushing past, his white hair flowing out behind him as he stood poised at the forward rail. He was not enjoying this scenario, though. There were many pirates along the Sword Coast well capable of destroying Quester, larger and better armed and armored than the well structured caravel, truly the hunting lions of the region. But this approaching ship was more a bird of prey, a swift and cunning hunter designed for smaller quarry, for fishing boats wandering too far from protected harbors or the luxury barges of wealthy merchants who let their warship escorts get a bit too far away from them. Or pirate schooners would work in conjunction, several on a target, a fleet hunting pack. But no other sails were to be seen on any horizon. From a different pouch, Drizzt took out his onyx figurine. \"I will bring in Guenhwyvar soon,\" he explained to Regis and Bruenor. Captain Vaines came up again, a nervous expression stamped on his face-one that told the drow that, despite his many years at sea, Vaines had not seen much battle. \"With a proper run the panther can leap fifty feet or more to gain the deck of our enemies\u0027 ship. Once there she will make more than a few call for a retreat.\" \"I have heard of your panther friend,\" Vaines said. \"She was much the talk of Waterdeep Harbor.\" \"Ye better bring the damned cat up soon then,\" Bruenor grumbled, looking out over the rail. Indeed, the schooner already seemed much closer, speeding over the waves. To Drizzt the image struck him as purely out of control; suicidal, like the giant that had followed them out of the Spine of the World. He put the figurine on the ground and called softly for the panther, watching as the telltale gray mist began to swirl about the statue, gradually taking shape. Catti-brie wiped her eyes, then lifted the spyglass once again, scanning the deck, hardly believing what she saw. But again she saw the truth of it all: that this was no pirate, at least none of the kind she had ever before seen. There were women aboard, and not warrior women, not even sailors, and surely not prisoners. And children! Several she had seen, and none of them dressed as cabin boys. She winced as a ballista spear grazed the schooner\u0027s deck, skipping off a turnstile and cracking through the side rail, only missing a young boy by a hands\u0027 breadth. \"Get ye down, and be quick,\" she instructed the lookout sharing the crow\u0027s nest. \"Tell yer captain to load chain and take her in her high sails.\" The man, obviously impressed with the tales he had heard of Drizzt and Catti-brie, turned without hesitation and started down the rope, but the woman knew that the task for stopping this coming travesty had fallen squarely upon her shoulders. Quester had dropped to battle sail, but the schooner kept at full, kept its run straight and swift, and seemed as if it meant to smash right through the larger caravel. Catti-brie put up the spyglass again, scanning slowly, searching, searching. She knew now that Drizzt\u0027s guess about the schooner\u0027s course and intent had been correct, knew that this was Crenshinibon\u0027s doing, and that truth made her blood boil with rage. One, or two, perhaps, would be the key, but where . . . She spotted the man at the forward rail of the flying bridge, his form mostly obscured by the mainmast. She held her sights on him for a long while, resisting the urge to shift and observe damage as Quester\u0027s ballistae let fly again, this time in accord with Catti-brie\u0027s orders. Spinning chains ripped high through the schooner\u0027s top sails. This sight, this man at the rail, one hand gripping the wood so tightly that it was white for lack of blood, was more important. The schooner flinched, the ship veering slightly, unintentionally, until the crew could work the ballistaaltered sails to put her in line again. In that turn, the image of the man at the rail drifted clear of the obstructing mast, and Catti-brie saw him clearly, saw the crazed look upon his face, saw the line of drool running from the corner of his mouth. And she knew. She dropped the spyglass and took up Taulmaril, lining her shot with great care, using the mainmast as a guide, for she could hardly even see the target. \"If they\u0027ve a wizard, he should have acted by now,\" a frantic Captain Vaines cried. \"For what do they wait? To tease us, as a cat to a mouse?\" Bruenor looked at the man and snorted derisively. \"They\u0027ve no wizard,\" Drizzt assured the captain. \"Do they mean to simply ram us, then?\" the captain asked. \"We\u0027ll take her down, then!\" He turned to yell new instructions to the ballista crews, to instruct his archers to rake the deck. But before he uttered a word a silver streak from the nest above startled him. He spun around to see the streak cut across the schooner\u0027s deck, then angle sharply to the right and fly out over the open sea. Before he could begin to question it another streak shot out, following nearly the same course, except that this one didn\u0027t deflect. It soared right past the schooner\u0027s mainmast. Everything seemed to come to a stop, a tangible pause from caravel and schooner alike. \"Hold the cat!\" Catti-brie called down to Drizzt. Vaines looked at the drow doubtfully, but Drizzt didn\u0027t doubt, not at all. He put his hand up and called Guenhwyvar who had moved back on the deck to get a running start-back to his side. \"It is ended,\" the dark elf announced. The captain\u0027s doubting expression melted as the schooner\u0027s mainsail dropped, the ship\u0027s prow also dropping instantly, deeper into the sea. Her back beam swung out wide, turning the triangular back sail. She leaned far to the side, turning her prow back toward the east, back toward the far distant shore. Through the spyglass, Catti-brie saw a woman kneeling over the dead man while another man cradled his head. An emptiness settled in Catti-brie\u0027s breast, for she never enjoyed such an action, never wanted to kill anyone. But that man had been the antagonist, the driving force behind a battle that would have left many innocents on the schooner dead. Better that he pay for his failings with his own life alone than with the lives of others. She told herself that repeatedly. It helped but a little. Certain that the fight had indeed been avoided, Drizzt looked down at the crystal shard once more with utter contempt. A single call to a single man had nearly brought ruin to so many. He could not wait to be rid of the thing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-silent-blade-paths-of-darkness-1/page-16.html","bookId":2131,"book":{"id":2131,"title":"The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1)","description":"Storyline: The Silent Blade (Paths of Darkness #1) Can the Crystal Shard be destroyed at last?
