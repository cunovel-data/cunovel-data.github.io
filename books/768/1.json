{"id":11010,"no":1,"title":"SCENE I","content":"\"What? My sweet Lady Standish in tears!\" Mistress Kitty Bellairs poised her dainty person on one foot and cast a mocking, somewhat contemptuous, yet good-humoured glance at the slim length of sobbing womanhood prone on the gilt-legged, satin-cushioned sofa. \"Tears,\" said Mistress Kitty, twirling round on her heel to look at the set of her new sacque in the mirror and admire its delicate flowered folds, as they caught the shafts of spring sunshine that pierced into the long dim room from the narrow street. \"Tears, my dear, unless you cry becomingly, which I would have you know not one in the thousand can, are a luxury every self-respecting woman ought to deny herself. Now I,\" said Mistress Kitty, and tweaked at a powdered curl and turned her head like a bird for a last glimpse at the mirror before sinking into an arm-chair and drawing closer to her afflicted friend, \"have not shed a tear since I lost my first lover, and that is—I will not say how many years ago. I was a mightily precocious child! When I say a tear, mind you, \u0027tis a figure of speech. Far be it from me to deny the charm of a pearly drop—just one: enough to gather on the tip of the finger, enough just to suffuse the pathetic eye. Oh, that is not only permissible, \u0027tis to be cultivated. But such weeping as yours—sobs that shake you, tears that drench the handkerchief, redden the eyes, not to speak of the nose—fie! fie! it is clean against all reason. Come!\" with a sudden gentle change of tone, putting her hand on the abased head, where fair curls luxuriated in all their native sunshine, \"what is it all about?\" Lady Standish slowly and languidly drew herself into a sitting posture, and raised a countenance marred out of its delicate beauty by the violent passion of her grief. Swimming blue eyes she fixed upon the Mistress Kitty\u0027s plump dimpling face. \"Alas!\" she breathed upon the gust of a sigh that was as wet as an April breeze, and tripped up by a belated sob. \"Alas! you see in me the most miserable of women. Alas! my heart is broken!\" Here the kerchief, soaked indeed beyond all possible utility, was frantically held to streaming eyes once more. \"Mercy!\" cried the pretty widow, \"you could not take on worse if you had the smallpox: you a three-months\u0027 wife!\" \"Ah me!\" moaned Lady Standish. \"So,\" said Mistress Kitty, \"he has been a brute again, has he? Come, Julia, weep on my bosom. What is it now? Did he kiss you on the forehead instead of on the lips? Or did he say: \u0027Zounds, madam!\u0027 when you upset a dish of tea over his waistcoat? Or yet did he, could he, the monster!—nay it is not possible, yet men are so—could he have whispered that Lady Caroline looked—passable last night?\" Lady Standish rose to her feet, crumpled her kerchief in one small hand and faced her friend with tragic passion. \"It is useless to blind myself,\" she said. \"Cease to gibe at me, pray, Mistress Bellairs; I must face the truth! My husband loves me no longer. Oh! Kitty, Kitty,\" dropping from her height of tragedy very quickly and landing on a whimper again, \"is it not sad? I have tried, Heaven is my witness, to win him back by the tenderest love, by the most pitiful pleading. He has seen me weep and pine. \u0027Rob me of your love,\u0027 I have told him, \u0027and you rob me of life.\u0027 And he, he—oh, how shall I tell you! As the days go by he is with me less and less. He walks abroad with others. His evenings he gives to strangers—ay, and half his nights—while I may sob myself to sleep at home. I saw him to-day but for two minutes—\u0027twas half an hour ago. He entered here upon me, looking, ah Kitty! as only he can look, the most elegant and beautiful of men. I was singing, piping as a poor bird may to strive and call its mate to the nest. He passed through the room without a word, without a sign; he that used to say \u0027twas heaven to sit and listen to my voice. \u0027What!\u0027 I exclaimed as he reached the door, \u0027not a word for poor Julia?\u0027 Kitty, at the sound of that cry, wrung from my heart, he turned and frowned, and said—— (Oh, oh, oh.)\" \"Ha!\" cried Mistress Kitty, \"what said he?\" (\"Heaven help him,\" said she aside; \"the woman\u0027s a fountain.\") \"He said,\" sobbed Julia, \"\u0027Mayn\u0027t a man even go for a stroll?\u0027 Oh, had you but heard the cold indifferent tone, you would have understood how it cut me to the heart. I ran to him and laid my hand upon his sleeve, and he said——\" Again grief overcame her. \"Well, what said he?\" \"He said—oh, oh—he said, \u0027Julia don\u0027t paw me.\u0027\" Mistress Kitty Bellairs, the reigning toast of Bath, the prettiest woman, in the estimation of her admirers, in all England, and the wittiest, laughed low to herself, then rose from her chair, took her tall friend by the shoulders, and walked her up to the mirror. \"Look at yourself,\" said she, \"and look at me.\" Lady Standish winced. The contrast between her own dishevelled hair, her marbled swollen countenance, her untidy morning gown, and the blooming perfection of the apparition beside her, was more than she could contemplate. Kitty Bellairs—as complete in every detail of beauty as a carnation—smiled upon herself sweetly. \"My dear,\" said she, \"I have had thirty-seven declared adorers these three years, and never one tired of me yet. Poor Bellairs,\" she said with a light sigh, \"he had two wives before me, and he was sixty-nine when he died, but he told me with his last breath that \u0027twas I gave him all the joy he ever knew.\" Lady Standish ceased weeping as suddenly as if her tears had been mechanically turned off. She regarded the widow earnestly. \"Now, child,\" said Mistress Bellairs, with all the authority of her twenty-six years, \"here we have been four weeks acquainted, and you have more than once done me the honour of saying that you considered me your friend.\" \"\u0027Tis so,\" said Lady Standish. \"Then listen to me. There are three great rules to be observed in our dealings with men. The first rule comprises an extraordinary number of minor details, but briefly and comprehensively it runs thus: Never be monotonous! Second rule: Never let a man be too sure of you! Oh that is a wonderful wise maxim: reflect upon it. Third: Never, never let a man see how—well, how far from lovely you can look! Tush, tush, you are a better-looking woman than I am, but not when you have been blubbering and not when you are fretful.\" Lady Standish suddenly sat down as if her limbs could support her no more. She looked up at the ceiling with tear-dimmed eyes. \"Pray,\" said Mistress Kitty inquisitorially ex cathedra, \"how many times a day do you tell that unfortunate man that you love him? And, worse still, how many times a day do you want him to say that he loves you? I vow \u0027tis enough to drive him to cards, or wine, or something infinitely worse that also begins with a w! And, pray, if you spend all you have, and empty your purse, do you think your purse becomes a very valuable possession? \u0027Tis a mere bit of leather. Nay, nay, keep your gold, and give it out piece by piece, and do not give it at all unless you get good change for it. Oh,\" cried Kitty, a fine flush of indignation rising scarlet behind her rouge, \"I marvel that women should be such fools!—to act the handmaid where they should ever rule as mistress; to cast forth unsought what they should dole out only to the supplicant on bended knee. Hath a man ever had from me an unsolicited avowal? Have I ever thrown the most ardent lover more than a \u0027perhaps\u0027 and \u0027it may be,\u0027 a smile, a dimple, a finger-tip? (What they have stolen I have not given, that is obvious! And, besides, \u0027tis neither here nor there.) And pray, Lady Standish, since when have you left off putting on rouge and having your hair tired and powdered, and wearing a decent gown of mornings and a modish sacque, and a heel to that pretty foot, a jewel in the ear and a patch beneath the lip?\" Lady Standish had ceased contemplating the ceiling; she was looking at her friend. \"But, madam,\" she said, \"this is strange advice. Would you have me coquette with my husband, as if—God forgive me for even saying such a thing—as if I were not wife, but mistress?\" \"La, you there,\" said Mistress Bellairs, and clapped her hands, \"there is the whole murder out! You are the man\u0027s lawful, honest wife, and therefore all tedium and homeliness, all fretful brow and tearful eye. God save us! who shall blame him if he seek a pleasant glint of vice to change him of you?\" There fell a silence. Lady Standish rose indignant, grew red, grew pale, caught a glimpse of herself again in the mirror, shrank from the sight, and crept back to the sofa with a humble and convicted air. Then she cast a look of anguished pleading at Mistress Bellairs\u0027s bright unfeeling countenance. \"Tell me,\" she said with a parched lip, \"what shall I do?\" \"Do!\" cried the widow, rising with a brisk laugh, \"get some powder into your hair, and some colour into those cheeks! And when Sir Jasper returns (he left you in tears, he will be sullen when he comes home; \u0027tis a mere matter of self-defence) let him find you gay, distraite; say a sharp thing or two if you can; tell him you do not need his company this afternoon. Ah, and if you could make him jealous! \u0027Tis a very, very old trick, but then, you see, love is a very old game, the oldest of all. Make him jealous, my dear, make him jealous and you\u0027ll win the rubber yet!\" \"Jealous!\" cried the three-months\u0027 wife, and all the blood of the innocent country girl leapt to her brow. \"Oh, madam, how could that be?\" \"Look out a beau, nay, two or three, \u0027tis safer! Talk discreetly with them in the Pump-Room, let them fan you at the ball, let them meet you in Orange-Grove. Or, if you have not spirit enough—and indeed, my sweet life, you sadly lack spirit—start but an imaginary one, merely for the use of your lord and master: I wager you he will rise to the fly.\" \"I am afraid Sir Jasper could be very jealous,\" said the other uneasily. \"I remember before we were wed, when my cousin Harry would ride with me to the meet, oh, how angry Sir Jasper was! He swore he would shoot himself, ay, and he was all for shooting Harry too.\" \"But he was not the less ardent with you on the score of it, I\u0027ll warrant him,\" said the experienced Mistress Bellairs. \"Ah, no,\" said Lady Standish, and her lip trembled over a smile, while the ready water sprang to her eyelashes, and: \"Ah, no!\" she said again. \"Indeed, he loved me then very ardently.\" \"And he\u0027ll love you so still if you have but a spark of courage. Get you to your room,\" said the widow, goodhumouredly, \"bustle up and play your part. Where is that woman of yours?\" She pushed Lady Standish before her as she spoke, herself rang the call-bell for the tire-woman, and gave a few pregnant suggestions to that worthy, who advanced all sour smiles and disapproving dips. Then she strolled back into the drawing-room and paused a moment as she slipped on her long gloves. Next she drew a letter from her pocket and began to read it with a thoughtful brow. \"No, no, Sir Jasper,\" she said half aloud, \"you\u0027re a fine gentleman, and a pretty fellow, you have a neat leg, and an eloquent turn of speech, but I will not have the child\u0027s heart broken for the amusement of an idle day.\" She took the letter between each little forefinger and thumb as if to tear it, thought better of it, folded it again and thrust it back into its place of concealment. Presently she smiled to herself, and walked out of the long open window across the little strip of garden, and so through the iron gate into the shady back street.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1945/55681.html","bookId":768,"book":{"id":768,"title":"The Bath Comedy","description":"简介： Mistress Kitty Bellairs poised her dainty person on one foot and cast a mocking, somewhat contemptuous, yet good-humoured glance at the slim length of sobbing womanhood prone on the gilt-legged, satin-cushioned sofa....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1945","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:17 AM"}}
