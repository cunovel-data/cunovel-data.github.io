{"id":11014,"no":5,"title":"SCENE V","content":"As he stood turning the seething brew of his dark thoughts, there came a pair of knowing raps upon the street-door, and in upon him strode with cheery step and cry the friends he was expecting. \n \n \"Ah, Jasper, lad,\" cried Tom Stafford, and struck him upon his shoulder, \"lying in wait for us? Gad, you\u0027re a blood-thirsty fellow!\" \n \n \"And quite right,\" said Colonel Villiers, clinking spurred legs, and flinging off a military cloak. \"Zounds, man, would you have him sit down in his dishonour?\" \n \n Sir Jasper stretched a hand to each; and holding him by the elbows they entered his private apartment and closed the door with such carefulness that the tall footman had no choice but to take it in turns to listen and peep through the key-hole. \n \n \"Tom,\" said Sir Jasper, \"Colonel Villiers, when I begged you to favour me with this interview, I was anxious for your services because, as I told you, of a strong suspicion of Lady Standish\u0027s infidelity to me. Now, gentlemen, doubt is no longer possible, I have the proofs!\" \n \n \"Come, come, Jasper, never be down-hearted,\" cried jovial Tom Stafford. \"Come, sir, you have been too fond of the little dears in your day not to know what tender yielding creatures they are. \u0027Tis their nature man; and then, must they not follow the mode? Do you want to be the only husband in Bath whose wife is not in the fashion? Tut, tut, so long as you can measure a sword for it and let a little blood, why, \u0027tis all in the day\u0027s fun!\" \n \n \"Swords?\" gurgled Colonel Villiers. \"No, no, pistols are the thing, boy. You are never sure with your sword: \u0027tis but a dig in the ribs, a slash in the arm, and your pretty fellow looks all the prettier for his pallor, and is all the more likely to get prompt consolation in the proper quarter. Ha!\" \n \n \"Consolation!\" cried Sir Jasper, as if the word were a blow. \"Ay, consolation! damnation!\" \n \n \"Whereas with your bullet,\" said the Colonel, \"in the lungs, or in the brain—at your choice—the job is done as neat as can be. Are you a good hand at the barkers, Jasper?\" \n \n \"Oh, I can hit a haystack!\" said Sir Jasper. But he spoke vaguely. \n \n \"I am for the swords, whenever you can,\" cried comely Stafford, crossing a pair of neat legs as he spoke and caressing one rounded calf with a loving hand. \"\u0027Tis a far more genteel weapon. Oh, for the feel of the blades, the pretty talk, as it were, of one with the other! \u0027Ha, have I got you now, my friend?\u0027—\u0027Ha, would you step between me and my wife? or my mistress? or my pleasure?\u0027—as the case may be. \u0027Would you? I will teach you, sa—sa!\u0027 Now—now one in the ribs! One under that presuming heart! Let the red blood flow, see it drop from the steel: that is something like! Pistols, what of them! pooh! Snap, you blow a pill into the air, and \u0027tis like enough you have to swallow it yourself! \u0027Tis for apothecaries, say I, and such as have not been brought up to the noble and gentlemanly art of self-defence.\" \n \n \"Silence, Tom,\" growled the Colonel; \"here is no matter for jesting. This friend of ours has had a mortal affront, has he not? \u0027Tis established. Shall he not mortally avenge himself upon him who has robbed him of his honour? That is the case, is it not? And, blast me, is not the pistol the deadlier weapon and therefore the most suited? Hey?\" \n \n Sir Jasper made an inarticulate sound that might have passed for assent or dissent, or merely as an expression of excessive discomfort of feeling. \n \n \"To business then,\" cried Colonel Villiers. \"Shall I wait upon Lord Verney and suggest pistols at seven o\u0027clock to-morrow morning in Hammer\u0027s Fields? That is where I generally like to place such affairs: snug enough to be out of disturbers\u0027 way, and far enough to warm the blood with a brisk walk. Gad, \u0027twas but ten days ago that I saw poor Ned Waring laid as neatly on his back by Lord Tipstaffe (him they call Tipsy Tip, you know) as ever it was done; as pretty a fight! Six paces, egad, and Ned as determined a dog as a fellow could want to second. \u0027Villiers,\u0027 said he, as I handed him his saw-handle, \u0027if I do not do for him, may he do for me! One of us must kill the other,\u0027 said he. \u0027Twas all about Mistress Waring, you know, dashed pretty woman! Poor Ned, he made a discovery something like yours, eh? Faith! ha, ha! And devil take it, sir, Tip had him in the throat at the first shot, and Ned\u0027s bullet took off Tipstaffe\u0027s right curl! Jove, it was a shave! Ned never spoke again. Ah, leave it to me; see if I do not turn you out as rare a meeting.\" \n \n \"But stay,\" cried Stafford, as Sir Jasper writhed in his arm-chair, clenched and unclenched furious hands and felt the curl of red hair burn him where he had thrust it into his bosom. \"Stay,\" cried Stafford, \"we are going too fast, I think. Do I not understand from our friend here that he called Lord Verney a rat? Sir Jasper is therefore himself the insulting party, and must wait for Lord Verney\u0027s action in the matter.\" \n \n \"I protest,\" cried the Colonel, \"the first insult was Lord Verney\u0027s in compromising our friend\u0027s wife.\" \n \n \"Pooh, pooh,\" exclaimed Stafford, recrossing his legs to bring the left one into shapely prominence this time, \"that is but the insult incidental. But to call a man a rat, that is the insult direct. Jasper is therefore the true challenger; the other has the choice of arms. It is for Lord Verney to send to our friend!\" \n \n \"Sir!\" exclaimed the Colonel, growing redder about the gills than Nature and port wine had already made him. \"Sir, would you know better than I?\" \n \n \"Gentlemen,\" said Sir Jasper, sitting up suddenly, \"as I have just told you, since I craved of your kindness that you would help me in this matter, I have made discoveries that alter the complexion of the affair very materially. I have reason to believe that if Lord Verney be guilty in this matter it is in a very minor way. You know what they call in France un chandelier. Indeed it is my conviction—such is female artfulness—that he has merely been made a puppet of to shield another person. It is this person I must find first, and upon him that my vengeance must fall before I can attend to any other business. Lord Verney indeed has already sent to me, but his friend, Captain Spicer, a poor fool (somewhat weak in the head, I believe), left suddenly without our coming to any conclusion. Indeed, I do not regret it—I do not seek to fight with Lord Verney now. Gentlemen,\" said Sir Jasper, rising and drawing the letter from his breast—\"gentlemen, I shall neither eat nor sleep till I have found out the owner of this curl!\" \n \n He shook out the letter as he spoke, and fiercely thrust the tell-tale love-token under the noses of his amazed friends. \"It is a red-haired man, you see! There lives no red-haired man in Bath but him I must forthwith spit or plug lest the villain escape me!\" \n \n Colonel Villiers started to his feet with a growl like that of a tiger aroused from slumber. \n \n \"Zounds!\" he exclaimed. \"An insult.\" \n \n \"How!\" cried Jasper, turning upon him and suddenly noticing the sandy hue of his friend\u0027s bushy eyebrows. \"You, good God! You? Pooh, pooh, impossible, and yet.... Colonel Villiers, Sir!\" cried Sir Jasper, in awful tones, \"did you write this letter? Speak! Yes or no, man! Speak, or must I drag the words from your throat?\" \n \n Purple and apoplectic passion well-nigh stifled Colonel Villiers. \n \n \"Stafford, Stafford,\" he spluttered, \"you are witness. These are gross affronts, affronts which shall be wiped out.\" \n \n \"Did you write that letter? Yes or no!\" screamed Sir Jasper, shaking the offending document in the Colonel\u0027s convulsed countenance. \n \n \"I?\" cried the Colonel, and struck away Sir Jasper\u0027s hand with a furious blow, \"I? I write such brimstone nonsense? No, sir! Now, damn you body and soul, Sir Jasper, how dare you ask me such a question?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Sir Jasper, \"of course not! Ah, I am a fool, Villiers. Forgive me. There\u0027s no quarrel between us! No, of course it could not be you! With that nose, that waistcoat, your sixty years! Gad, I am going mad!\" \n \n \"Why, man,\" said Stafford, as soon as he could speak for laughing, \"Villiers has not so much hair on all his head as you hold in your hand there. Off with your wig, Villiers, off with your wig, and let your bald pate proclaim its shining innocence.\" \n \n The gallant gentleman thus addressed was by this time black in the face. Panting as to breath, disjointed as to speech, his fury had nevertheless its well-defined purpose. \n \n \"I have been insulted, I have been insulted,\" he gasped; \"the matter cannot end here. Sir Jasper, you have insulted me. I am a red-haired man, sir. I shall send a friend to call upon you.\" \n \n \"Nay, then,\" said Sir Jasper, \"since \u0027tis so between us I will even assure myself that Tom has spoken the truth and give you something to fight for!\" He stretched out his hand as he spoke, and plucked the wig from Colonel Villiers\u0027 head. \n \n Before him indeed spread so complete an expanse of hairless candour, that further evidence was not necessary; yet the few limp hairs that lingered behind the Colonel\u0027s ears, if they had once been ruddy, shone now meekly silver in the candle-light. \n \n \"I thank you,\" said Sir Jasper, \"that is sufficient. When you send your friend to call upon me, I shall receive him with pleasure.\" He handed back the Colonel\u0027s wig with a bow. \n \n The Colonel stood trembling, his knotted hand instinctively fumbled for his sword. But remembering perhaps that this was eminently a case for pistols, he bethought himself, seized his wig, clapped it on defiantly, settled it with minute care, glared, wheeled round and left the room, muttering as he went remarks of so sulphurous a nature as to defy recording. \n \n Sir Jasper did not seem to give him another thought. He fell into his chair again and spread out upon his knee the sorely crumpled letter. \n \n \"Confusion!\" said he. Who can it be? \"Tom, you scamp, I know your hair is brown. Thou art not the man, Tom. Oh, Tom, oh, Tom, if I do not kill him I shall go mad!\" \n \n Stafford was weak with laughter, and tears rolled from his eyes as he gasped: \n \n \"Let us see, who can the Judas be? (Gad, this is the best joke I have known for years. Oh, Lord, the bald head of him! Oh, Jasper, \u0027tis cruel funny! Stab me, sir, if I have known a better laugh these ten years!) Nay, nay, I will help thee. Come, there\u0027s his Lordship the Bishop of Bath and Wells, he is red, I know, for I have seen him in the water. Gad, he was like a boiled lobster, hair and all. Could it be he, think you? They have a way, these divines, and Lady Standish has a delicate conscience. She would like the approval of the Church upon her deeds. Nay, never glare like that, for I will not fight you! Have you not got your rosary of red polls to tell first. Ha! there is O\u0027Hara, he is Irish enough and rake enough and red enough. Oh, he is red enough!\" \n \n \"O\u0027Hara,\" cried Sir Jasper, struck. \n \n There came a fine rat-tat-tat at the door, a parley in the hall, and the servant announced Mr. Denis O\u0027Hara. \n \n \"Talk of the devil,\" said Stafford. \n \n Sir Jasper rose from his armchair with the air of one whose enemy is delivered into his hands. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1945/55685.html","bookId":768,"book":{"id":768,"title":"The Bath Comedy","description":"简介： Mistress Kitty Bellairs poised her dainty person on one foot and cast a mocking, somewhat contemptuous, yet good-humoured glance at the slim length of sobbing womanhood prone on the gilt-legged, satin-cushioned sofa....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1945","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:17 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:17 AM"}}
