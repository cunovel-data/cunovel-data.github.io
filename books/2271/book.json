{"id":2271,"title":"The Seance (Harrison Investigation #5)","description":"Storyline: The Seance (Harrison Investigation #5) \\n A chill falls over Christina Hardy\u0027s housewarming party when talk turns to a recent murder that has all the hallmarks of the so-called \u0027Interstate Killer\u0027 murders from fifteen years before. To lighten the mood, the guests drag out an old Ouija board for a little spooky fun -- and that\u0027s when things become truly terrifying. \\n Summoned by the Ouija board, the restless spirit of Beau Kidd, the lead detective -- and chief suspect -- on the original case, seeks Christina\u0027s help: the latest killing isn\u0027t a copycat crime, and he wants his name cleared. Back in the real world, cop-turned-writer Jed Braden is skeptical of Christina\u0027s ghostly encounters, but his police sources confirm all the intimate details of the case -- her otherworldly source is reliable, and the body count is growing. \\n The spirits are right. The Interstate Killer is still out there, and Christina\u0027s life is hanging in the balance between this world and the next.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-seance-harrison-investigation-5.jpg","author":"Heather Graham","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
