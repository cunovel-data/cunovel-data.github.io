{"id":96699,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Wroth shot up in bed, feeling nauseated, physically ill from his nightmares.\\n\\n He\u0027d been lashed by the usual dreams of her gloating at a gravesite, then the Roman stroking himself as she slowly dragged her skirt up her thighs. \"I\u0027ll possess Myst the Coveted...\"\\n\\n But details of the memories became more evident each time. This time he\u0027d heard Myst\u0027s amused thoughts at his words - No one possesses me, but in their fantasies. I\u0027ll kill you as easily as kiss you... \"And I\u0027ll be yours, only yours,\" she purred, though she detested him.\\n\\n Now he\u0027d seen something new. A different, more recent memory. Myst was smoothing on hose, her foot daintily placed on his bed, as she made a decision to...trick him? To act as though she\u0027d capitulated easily in order to get her chain back.\\n\\n Play at love and act at surrender.\\n\\n He gripped his forehead in his hand. Irrationally, he waited for the soft touch of her hand on his back. She was his Bride, his wife, and she offered him no comfort.\\n\\n Even had she truly had that urge, she couldn\u0027t, since he was still secretly commanding her to sleep throughout the day. So she wouldn\u0027t run away from him and leave him in torment again.\\n\\n Kill you as easily as kiss you...\\n\\n He\u0027d thought they\u0027d had a place to start from, to move forward from, but he\u0027d been fooled by her beauty and abandon. She\u0027d seduced him, made sure he \"caught\" her working her body that same night, knowing he would lose his mind at the sight.\\n\\n He was as much a fool as the Roman, besotted with a fantasy that didn\u0027t exist. At least that long-dead Roman had suffered no delusions that she could care for him. He\u0027d known that she was incapable of feeling and had wanted possession only.\\n\\n Wroth had been falling for a fantasy, one that easily manipulated him.\\n\\n She desired her freedom and she would use whatever means she had available to get it, leaving him as soon as she\u0027d succeeded.\\n\\n Fool.\\n\\n When Myst woke, she burrowed down into the covers, feeling relaxed and content to her toes.\\n\\n Today was D-day - delivery day for the chain - the end of the demo that she realized had resulted in a sale.\\n\\n She snuggled into his pillow, loving his scent, and considered her new feelings. She\u0027d feared her life as she\u0027d known it had ended the minute he\u0027d vowed to give her the chain back. It was a leap of faith on his part and she\u0027d responded to it. Responded in kind. It was a bit ironic that she\u0027d smugly planned to punk him only to get snared in her own machinations. She\u0027d lasted only a few days playing easy till she went easy, her femme fatale plans culminating in the oh-sonefarious leap into his arms.\\n\\n She grinned into the pillow. She\u0027d take back her chain, but only because it looked so damned sassy on her.\\n\\n When she rose and stretched, she found him watching her. Her grin widened, but he didn\u0027t return her smile, just glanced at her bare breasts and snapped, \"Put on some clothes.\"\\n\\n She drew her head back, frowning. \"Are you angry with me?\" He was usually brusque when they woke, but she could tell this was much worse. She was baffled by what could have happened since she\u0027d gone to sleep, tucked against his chest, secure under his heavy arm. His eyes were somehow crazed and bleak at the same time, his face exhausted. Alarm began to build inside her.\\n\\n \"We have a lot to discuss tonight.\" He tossed her a robe. \"Put it on and sit here.\"\\n\\n She had no choice but to comply. He traced away and was back seconds later, holding the chain fisted in his whitened grip. \"Tonight we\u0027re going to make some adjustments between us - or more accurately, in you.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"Wroth, what are you doing?\" she asked slowly. \"You vowed to give it back today.\"\\n\\n \"A woman like you should understand broken vows.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about? How can you do this to me now?\" The evening she\u0027d decided to stay.\\n\\n His face was crueler than she\u0027d ever seen it. \"You mean after the last two weeks? Just because you wanted to be fucked and I complied doesn\u0027t mean I won\u0027t treat you as you deserve.\"\\n\\n She put the back of her hand to her face as if she\u0027d been struck. He didn\u0027t say \"treat you as a whore,\" didn\u0027t call her that, but somehow he made her feel it. \"As I deserve,\" she repeated dumbly.\\n\\n He grasped her arm, squeezing it hard. \"I can\u0027t live like this, Myst. With this.\" At her confused expression, he said, \"I\u0027ve seen your past. I know what you were, what you are.\"\\n\\n \"What I was?\" Her frown deepened. She hadn\u0027t lived her life perfectly - there\u0027d been missteps and misjudgments - but she\u0027d done little to be ashamed of. Was the killing too much for him to handle? He\u0027d been a freaking warlord! \"If you find me lacking, know that I regret very few of my actions over my long life.\"\\n\\n That seemed to enrage him. \"No? What about playing at love and acting at surrender?\"\\n\\n \"Wroth, that was - \"\\n\\n \"Silence.\" He kissed her roughly, harshly, though she struggled against him before he pulled back. \"I\u0027ve realized you are heartless.\" His eyes appeared tortured, his entire body tight with tension. \"But what if I just ordered you to be kinder, then made you forget all the men that came before me? Made you forget all that, forget your vicious sisters who kill without remorse?\"\\n\\n She gasped, eyes watering, but she couldn\u0027t speak after his command. Her hands clenched. She\u0027d never wanted to scream more in her life, and yet her lips parted silently in shock when he said, \"I believe I\u0027ll just order you to want me so fiercely that you can\u0027t think of anything or anyone else - \"\\n\\n A voice interrupted from downstairs. \"General Wroth, you\u0027re needed at Oblak immediately.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" he bellowed. She felt his eyes on her as she staggered to the window seat, tears beginning to fall. She curled up, leaning her forehead against the glass.\\n\\n \"Your brother\u0027s been badly injured.\"\\n\\n He pointed at her. \"Stay here,\" he bit out, then disappeared. She heard him downstairs, locking away her freedom again, then he was gone once more. Stay here? In the room or the manor? He\u0027d been so thrown by the news that he hadn\u0027t elaborated.\\n\\n So stumbling, clutching at the wall as energy funneled out of her, she finally made her way to his study. She pulled aside the cabinet, finding the safe behind it. When she reached for the lock, her hand veered off course as though pushed by an unseen force. She bit her lip and tried again, fighting to simply brush the metal.\\n\\n Commanded not to touch it. Just like he would command her to forget who she was, that she even had a family. Lightning cracked outside in time with a sob. He\u0027d been about to do it.\\n\\n It was true then. Vampires couldn\u0027t be trusted - he\u0027d seemed out of his mind with rage. Why had she gone against all she\u0027d ever learned to be with him?\\n\\n The years had been weighing on her and she\u0027d been overwhelmed by the yearning to simply lean on someone, just for a while, to have a partner to watch her back and hold her when she needed it. Surely she\u0027d convinced herself to accept him because he was strong and she had grown so weak. No longer.\\n\\n There were ways she could get around his orders - nimble thinking, creative reasoning. As tears poured from her eyes and the lightning grew to constant furious bolts, she tore at the wall, at the very stone that housed it.\\n\\n So he would use her? Like a toy. A mindless slave. Adjustments?\\n\\n Toy, bait, whore...Just because you wanted to be fucked, he\u0027d sneered.\\n\\n Two millennia of people thinking they could use her. Always using her.\\n\\n She\u0027d take this safe with her teeth if she had to.\\n\\n \"You should see the other guy,\" Murdoch grated from his bed when Wroth traced into his room.\\n\\n Wroth shuddered to see his brother\u0027s face torn and limbs broken like this even while knowing he couldn\u0027t die from anything short of a beheading or sunlight. He shook himself. \"What has happened to you?\" he asked, his voice a rasp.\\n\\n \"About to ask you the same. My God, Nikolai, you look worse than I do.\"\\n\\n He thought about how he\u0027d left Myst at the window, crying, staring out at the lightning storm that came from within her. It pained him so much to think of her hurting alone... \"We\u0027ll talk of my problems later. Who has done this to you?\"\\n\\n \"Ivo has demons. Demons turned vampires. They are strong - you can\u0027t imagine it. He is looking for someone, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s your Bride - they mentioned something about a \u0027halfling\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"How many?\"\\n\\n \"There were three in his party - other vampires as well. We took down two of the demons but one remains.\" He glanced behind him. \"Where\u0027s your Bride?\"\\n\\n After a hesitation, he explained everything, seeking the same unburdening he felt when he spoke with Myst. His brother\u0027s expression grew stark.\\n\\n Long moments of silence passed before he said incredulously, \"Wroth, you took away the free will of a creature that has had it for two thousand years. A good wager says she\u0027s going to want it back.\"\\n\\n \"No, you don\u0027t understand. She\u0027s callous. Incapable of love. It eats at me, her deception, because it\u0027s the only thing that makes sense.\" More to himself, he muttered, \"Why else would she want me?\"\\n\\n Murdoch weakly grabbed Wroth\u0027s wrist. \"For all these years I\u0027ve seen you continually choose the best, most rational course, even if it\u0027s the most difficult. I\u0027ve been proud to follow your leadership because you\u0027ve acted with courage and always - always - with rationality. I never thought I would have to inform you that your reason and judgment have failed you, Nikolai. If she\u0027s as bad as you say then you have to...I don\u0027t know, just help her change, but you can\u0027t order this. Get back to her. Explain your fears to her.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I can. You saw her, Murdoch. Why would she so quickly acquiesce?\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you just ask her?\"\\n\\n Because I don\u0027t want to show her again how craven I\u0027ve become with wanting her.\\n\\n \"And about the other men - this isn\u0027t the sixteen hundreds anymore,\" Murdoch said. \"This isn\u0027t even the same plane. She\u0027s immortal, not an eighteen-year-old blushing bride straight from a convent. She can\u0027t change these things, so if you want her, you have to adjust.\"\\n\\n Wroth ran a hand over his face and snapped, \"When did you get so bloody understanding?\"\\n\\n Murdoch shrugged. \"I had someone explain a few rules of the Lore to me and learned we can\u0027t apply our human expectations to the beings within it.\"\\n\\n \"Who told you this?\" When he didn\u0027t answer, Wroth didn\u0027t press, not with all the secrets he\u0027d been keeping. \"Will you be all right?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the thing about being immortal. It\u0027ll always look worse than it is.\"\\n\\n Wroth attempted a grin and failed.\\n\\n \"Good luck, Nikolai.\"\\n\\n Outside of the room, he spoke with those watching over Murdoch and emphasized what would happen to them should his brother worsen, then contemplated tracing back. He was almost glad when Kristoff called a meeting about this newest threat, grateful for the time to cool off before he faced Myst again.\\n\\n Kristoff didn\u0027t hesitate to ask, \"Why didn\u0027t your wife tell you about the turned demons?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I will ask her when I return.\" He wondered as well. Had she known? No, she\u0027d been teaching him everything she knew - teaching him constantly.\\n\\n Why would she do that if she only planned to leave him?\\n\\n When he cringed, he realized Kristoff was still studying him.\\n\\n \"Something to add?\"\\n\\n He owed Kristoff his life and the life of his brothers. Three brothers and for Myst herself, he owed his king. He would withhold information on Myst\u0027s kind but relate the rest. \"I\u0027ve learned a good deal about the Lore from her and want to discuss it with you, but I left my wife feeling poorly. I\u0027d like to get back to her.\"\\n\\n \"By all means,\" Kristoff said, his face unreadable. \"But tomorrow we\u0027ll talk of this.\"\\n\\n Wroth nodded, then traced back to Myst, frowning as a hazy idea surfaced in the turmoil of his mind. Had his brother\u0027s heart been beating earlier? But before he could contemplate this further, Wroth\u0027s attention was distracted by Myst\u0027s sleeping form. He gazed down at her, chest aching as usual. Sometimes he damned his beating heart because of the pain that seemed to follow it.\\n\\n Murdoch was right. She couldn\u0027t change what she was, and he\u0027d wronged her today. If only he could think more clearly where she was concerned instead of reacting viscerally. Primitively. Before, he\u0027d never understood when men talked of madness and love in the same breath. Now he understood.\\n\\n He only hoped that when he asked her to forgive him his weakness, she could.\\n\\n After undressing, he climbed into bed with her. He pulled her close to him, running his hand down her arm, burying his face in her hair and smelling her soft, sweet scent. Finally at dawn, he passed out with exhaustion. When he dreamed, he opened his mind to her memories, to what had become his nightmares. They superseded all his other visions of battle and famine because these hurt him the most. See her in a sordid light. Punish yourself.\\n\\n See them all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-warlord-wants-forever-immortals-after-dark-1/page-10.html","bookId":2152,"book":{"id":2152,"title":"The Warlord Wants Forever (Immortals After Dark #1)","description":"Storyline: The Warlord Wants Forever (Immortals After Dark #1) \\n EXCLUSIVE EBOOK NOVELLA with teaser chapters of the hugely anticipated LOTHAIRE \\n Nikolai Wroth, once a ruthless human warlord in the 1700s and now a general in the rebel vampire army, needs to find his bride, the one woman who can render him truly alive.
