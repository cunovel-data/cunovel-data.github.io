{"id":96693,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Present Day Never-ending sexual desire that could never be slaked. She\u0027d knowingly - delightedly - surrendered him to this torment. His Bride had blooded him, giving him his first need as a vampire, then stoked it to a fever pitch - and only his Bride could work his body free to release the first time. If she had only stayed long enough for him to take her just once, or to merely touch her skin as he\u0027d taken his own ease, she could\u0027ve spared him this. But then she\u0027d clearly said that that was the plan. And for the last five years, Wroth had been cursed with more than that. He was cursed with her memories as well. The minuscule drop of blood taken directly from her body did more than make any other blood taste like tar to him - it did just what the Forbearers feared. With her living blood came dreams where her memories unfolded, so realistic they were as if he was there to experience scents she\u0027d smelled and textures she\u0027d felt. Sometimes he could even feel her hands clench in anger. But he\u0027d told no one, keeping his secrets because he didn\u0027t want to lose his power within their army - or be killed. Each sunset he rose and checked his eyes for the telltale red, and every day if he could manage to sleep, he was subjected to the same series of memories that subtly grew in detail each time. The first found her atop a hill, sun bright, with snow still on the ground. \"I\u0027ve cursed you to your hell,\" Myst hissed at the site of a rough gravestone. She was roiling with so much hostility that Wroth knew she must have killed whatever being lay there. She spoke an ancient language that Wroth shouldn\u0027t understand, but he did. He felt the sensations she\u0027d felt, the constant sway of her chain around her waist, the smell of the ocean just below her, brine on a cold day. Another familiar dream. A drunken Roman senator kneeling at her feet. \"At long last, I\u0027m about to have Myst the Coveted. And you\u0027ll no longer be coveted, you\u0027ll be possessed.\" He laughed. \"You\u0027ll make me twist on your little hook no longer.\" Wroth had discovered the full name of his tormenter. Myst the Coveted. With disgust, Wroth saw the Roman take Myst\u0027s dainty foot in his mouth, sucking greedily, stroking himself, as she slowly lifted her skirt up her silken thighs for him. As ever, Wroth fought not to see this, fought to wake. His violent revulsion never diminished over time. The first time he\u0027d had that dream, he\u0027d been relieved when another scene unfolded before that one came to some kind of sick conclusion. But never again... Myst was running past a Viking raiding party on the coast of some northern land. Purposely. She wanted them to hunt her. To catch her and throw her to the ground in the hard snow. What kind of twisted need did she have? She was excited, her blood pumping. Her skin felt like it was sizzling with electricity, and lightning was generated from her excitement. She stifled a smile, when with bellows and cheers, the men gave chase... As ever, Wroth fought to force his mind away before he saw a dozen Vikings rutting on his Bride. To her delight. Tonight a new dream. Finally. Snow outside, packed so high it covered half the window. Women, or other creatures like her, met around a great hearth. They were sisters and Wroth saw their faces as though familiar and knew their names and who they were as well as Myst did. He recognized the archer as Lucia, and the bright one he now knew was Regin the Radiant. A vacant-eyed one was called N\u0026iuml;x, the oldest of her sisters and believed to be a soothsayer. Their clothing indicated early twentieth century. They were meeting over the fate of a baby that their leader, a somber creature named Annika, wished to keep. Myst frowned at the little girl in Annika\u0027s arms, confused to feel some stirring of feeling for it. \"How are we to care for her, Annika?\" Lucia murmured. Regin snapped, \"How can you bring a vampire among us when they slaughtered my people?\" One named Daniela the Ice Maiden knelt beside Annika, gazing up at her, briefly touching her with a pale hand. Myst shivered to think of the pain Danii had just felt to offer that cold touch. Daniela\u0027s mother\u0027s people had been the ice fey and she couldn\u0027t be touched by anyone but one of them without extreme pain. \"She needs to be with her own kind. I know this well.\" Annika shook her head determinedly. \"Her ears. Her eyes. She\u0027s Valkyrie as much as vampire.\" Valkyrie...? Impossible. \"She\u0027ll grow to be evil,\" Regin insisted. \"She\u0027s already snapped at me with her baby fangs. By Freya, she drinks blood!\" \"Trifling,\" Myst interjected in a casual tone. \"We eat electricity.\" The vacant-eyed N\u0026iuml;x laughed. A vampire child? Eating electricity? His heart was racing... Annika said, \"I will keep Emmaline from the Horde and guide her to be all that was good and honorable about the Valkyrie before time eroded us.\" Her words were laced with sadness and triggered a memory that Myst hated. Wroth wanted to see it but couldn\u0027t. Annika rubbed noses with the baby and asked her, \"Now where\u0027s the best place to hide the most beautiful little vampire in the world?\" N\u0026iuml;x laughed delightedly. \"Laissez les bon temps roulez...\" New Orleans. Wroth shot up in bed, body drenched with sweat. My Bride\u0027s a Valkyrie? he thought with a choking cough. His mind couldn\u0027t wrap around the idea of it. He hadn\u0027t known they even existed. A character from legends told around campfires was linked to him for eternity. From the dreams, he knew she was a millennias-old mystical being born of a fierce Pictish princess - who\u0027d plunged a dagger into her heart rather than be taken alive by an enemy - and of gods. She didn\u0027t eat because she took electrical energy from the earth and gave it back with her emotions in the form of lightning. She was a killer and had been a Roman senator\u0027s whore. She despised men and enjoyed tormenting them, just as she\u0027d done with him. He glanced down at his throbbing erection. Even his hatred couldn\u0027t battle his relentless need for her. The impulse to take his cock in his fist was there, but he fought it, knowing he could never bring himself to come, knowing it would only increase his pain. For five years she\u0027d sentenced him to suffering from this constant, grueling ache. Before he\u0027d learned there was no relief without her, he would\u0027ve futilely stroked himself or thrust against the bed, imagining it was Myst clutched beneath him, but he never took release. Other females repelled him - because they weren\u0027t her. Even if he believed he could find ease with another woman, he would never demean himself with another. He\u0027d felt his Myst\u0027s incredible softness, felt her wet with desire for him, her body squeezing around his fingers as she\u0027d climaxed from his touch. He shuddered and his cock pulsed hungrily. Linked for eternity. To Myst the Coveted, a mythological being who despised him. The only way he\u0027d keep her for eternity would be to punish her for that long. He knew he coveted her as none other had. And now he knew where to find her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-warlord-wants-forever-immortals-after-dark-1/page-4.html","bookId":2152,"book":{"id":2152,"title":"The Warlord Wants Forever (Immortals After Dark #1)","description":"Storyline: The Warlord Wants Forever (Immortals After Dark #1) EXCLUSIVE EBOOK NOVELLA with teaser chapters of the hugely anticipated LOTHAIRE Nikolai Wroth, once a ruthless human warlord in the 1700s and now a general in the rebel vampire army, needs to find his bride, the one woman who can render him truly alive.
