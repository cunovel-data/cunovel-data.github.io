{"id":2671,"title":"The Sunbird (The Lion Hunters #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Sunbird (The Lion Hunters #3) \n Telemakos is the grandson of two noble men: Kidane, member of the parliament in the African kingdom of Aksum, and Artos, the fallen High King of Britain. Telemakos is also an exceptional listener and tracker, resolute and inventive in his ability to discover and retain information. Now his aunt Goewin, the British ambassador to Aksum, needs his skill. Plague has come to Britain, and threatens Aksum. Disguised, Telemakos must travel to the city of Afar where saltthe currency of sixth century Africais mined, and discover the traitor who has ignored the emperor\u0027s command, spreading plague with the salt from port to port. This challenge will take all of Telemakos\u0027s skill, strength, and couragebecause otherwise it will cost him his life. \n The Sunbird is the third in Elizabeth E. Wein\u0027s ongoing Arthurian/ Aksumite cycle. Its striking, spare language, riveting plot, and all-too-human characters are unforgettable. \n “The exotic culture and well-developed code of honor of the Aksumite court give this post-Arthurian/ancient Ethiopian fusion its striking flavor. . . . With her thorough command of historic characters, a grand scope, and a swift-paced, heroic plot, Wein has laid out an appealing and sumptuous literary banquet.” (The Horn Book)\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sunbird-the-lion-hunters-3.jpg","author":"Elizabeth Wein","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":22,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
