{"id":108304,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Madeleine had a checkup at the vet\u0027s office scheduled the next morning. I got out the stout metal cage Jane had bequeathed me and opened the little door. I put one of Madeleine\u0027s toys inside. I set the cage, door open, on the kitchen table. I put on gardening gloves.\\n\\n I had profited by experience. Madeleine knew the instant the cage came out. She could find places to hide you\u0027d swear a fat old cat could never squeeze into. I\u0027d quietly gone upstairs first and closed all the doors while Madeleine was in plain view on the couch, and even closed off the front downstairs living room and the downstairs bathroom. But still, Madeleine had disappeared.\\n\\n I groaned and started searching.\\n\\n This time she\u0027d wedged herself under the television stand.\\n\\n \"Come on, old girl,\" I coaxed, knowing I was wasting my breath.\\n\\n The battle raged for nearly twenty minutes. Madeleine and I cursed at each other, and very nearly spat at each other. But after that twenty minutes, Madeleine was in the cage, staring out with the haunted expression of a political prisoner being filmed by Amnesty International.\\n\\n I dabbed some antibiotic ointment on the worst scratches and pulled on my coat. I was bracing myself for the ordeal to come.\\n\\n Madeleine wailed all the way to Dr. Jamerson\u0027s office. Nonstop.\\n\\n Sometimes I loathed that cat.\\n\\n \"Oh, good, Madeleine\u0027s right on time,\" said Dr. Jamerson\u0027s nice receptionist with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. I returned a grim nod.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see. What does Madeleine need today?\"\\n\\n She knew damn good and well.\\n\\n \"All her shots.\"\\n\\n \"Charlie\u0027ll get his gloves,\" she said, heaving a resigned sigh. \"He\u0027ll be with you in just a minute.\"\\n\\n Charlie helped Dr. Jamerson with the really difficult animals. He was a huge cheerful young man, working at the vet\u0027s office until he had enough saved to go to college full-time instead of part- time.\\n\\n \"Is she here yet?\" I heard Charlie asked the receptionist apprehensively. A moment later Charlie stuck his head out into the waiting room.\\n\\n \"Right on time, as always, Miss Teagarden! And how is your kitty today?\"\\n\\n Madeleine yowled. The Labrador on the other side of the room began to whine and pressed his nose against his owner\u0027s leg. Charlie winced.\\n\\n \"Better bring her back,\" he said with false assurance. \"Doctor\u0027s waiting.\"\\n\\n I struggled with the heavy carrier, knowing I\u0027d have to heft it myself, since Madeleine had found out last time that her paw could fit through the mesh door nicely, even with her claws fully extended. Dr. Jamerson had all Madeleine\u0027s shots laid out ready, plus a generous supply of cotton balls and antiseptic. His jaw was set, and he gave me a grim smile.\\n\\n \"Bring her on, Miss Teagarden. We got through her neutering before, we\u0027ll get through her shots now. Thank God she\u0027s a healthy cat.\"\\n\\n That thought certainly gave me pause. If Madeleine was like this when she felt good- \"Oh, dear,\" I said.\\n\\n I pulled my gloves back on. \"Are you ready?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s do it,\" Dr. Jamerson said to Charlie and me, and we all nodded simultaneously. I unlatched the cage door and pulled it open.\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later I emerged from the vet\u0027s office, lugging the cage with the cat screaming triumphantly inside. She\u0027d had her shots. And we\u0027d pretty much had ours, too.\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t bleed very much, Mother,\" I said reassuringly when she called to see how Dr. Jamerson was doing.\\n\\n \"I sold him a house. He\u0027s such a nice man,\" she sighed. \"I wish you\u0027d take that cat to Dr. Caitlin. He went through Today\u0027s Homes.\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t see her,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n \"What time Saturday night?\" I asked. \"The banquet.\"\\n\\n \"What did you do with your invitation?\"\\n\\n \"It got lost or something.\"\\n\\n \"You need a bulletin board and some thumbtacks.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I know. What time do we need to be there?\"\\n\\n \"Drinks at seven, dinner at seven-thirty.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to be showing him some more houses, you know.\" \"Oh--no, we didn\u0027t talk about it.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing as grand as the Anderton place, but all in the one to two hundred thousand range. He must be planning on doing a lot of entertaining.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the head man here. I guess so.\"\\n\\n \"Still, a single man ... why does he want that much room?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Because he came from a poor farm in America\u0027s heartland? I had no idea.\\n\\n \"Well, I hope you know what you\u0027re doing.\"\\n\\n \"I do too,\" I said softly.\\n\\n \"Oh, Roe, have you got it bad?\" My mother was suddenly distressed.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, and closed my eyes.\\n\\n \"Oh, dear.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you Saturday night,\" I said hastily. \"Bye, Mother.\"\\n\\n \"Bye, baby.\" My mother was worried.\\n\\n I\u0027d rented a movie to watch that night, and I was curled up in front of the television wrapped in a quilt and eating crackers and peanut butter when Martin called. He just wanted to see if I was okay, he told me, after the incident with Sam Ulrich the morning before. He was lonely in his hotel room, he told me.\\n\\n After I hung up, I thought about his exercise equipment and his running and his racquetball, and I closed the peanut butter jar.\\n\\n And before I went to bed, I thought about Sam Ulrich--and Idella and Tonia Lee--and I double-checked all my doors and windows.\\n\\n I\u0027d just pulled on my jeans and a sweater the next morning when the phone rang.\\n\\n \"Roe,\" said the warm voice on the other end, \"how are you this morning?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, hi, Franklin.\" Mild curiosity stirred within me. \"I\u0027m all right.\"\\n\\n \"Not too shaken up by your dreadful experience?\"\\n\\n \"You mean finding Idella. It was just horrible, Franklin, but I haven\u0027t dwelt on it.\" I\u0027d been dwelling on something else. I felt myself smiling, and was ashamed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good. Life goes on,\" he said offhandedly. \"I called to see if by chance you would go with me to the realtor\u0027s banquet?\"\\n\\n Well, well. The legendary Franklin Farrell was asking little old me for a date. He\u0027d probably gone out with every other woman in Lawrenceton.\\n\\n \"Franklin, how nice of you to ask. I\u0027m flattered. But I already have plans for that night.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s too bad. Well, another time then.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for calling.\"\\n\\n If anyone had been there to see me, I would have raised my eyebrows in amazement. Franklin Farrell without a date, and the banquet so close? Something must have happened to his original plans. Did this mean someone had canceled on Franklin? That would indeed be news.\\n\\n I drummed my fingers on the kitchen counter.\\n\\n The next thing I knew, I was asking Patty to connect me with Eileen.\\n\\n \"How are you doing, honey?\" Eileen asked, but without her usual boom.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just fine. You?\"\\n\\n \"Still upset, Roe. I just can\u0027t stop seeing Idella, thrown down like a sack of garbage.\"\\n\\n \"It had to have been quick, Eileen. Maybe she didn\u0027t know anything about it.\"\\n\\n The paper had quoted Lynn as saying it was believed Idella\u0027d been strangled like Tonia Lee, though that wouldn\u0027t be a certainty until the autopsy. I did hope it had been quick, but I had a conviction that Idella had known exactly who was killing her and that she was being killed. I tried so hard not to imagine that that I bit my lip.\\n\\n \"I hope not,\" Eileen was sighing. \"Listen, Roe, not to change the subject, but I have to get on with my work, I guess. I took yesterday off. Do you want to do any more house-hunting today?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, Eileen. I\u0027ve kind of lost my taste for it, for a little while at least. I liked the Julius house so much better than anything I\u0027ve seen, but I have to ponder long and hard about whether I could live out of town without getting the willies every night.\"\\n\\n \"I can understand that, believe me. Just give me a call when you make up your mind.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, Eileen. Do you know if Idella had been dating anyone special?\"\\n\\n \"If she was, she didn\u0027t tell me who. But she had been very `up\u0027 lately, dressing more carefully, cheerful, eyes shiny, etcetera. Idella wasn\u0027t one to talk about her personal life. I worked with her for a month without her mentioning her children!\"\\n\\n \"She was closemouthed,\" I said, impressed. \"I just wondered if she hadn\u0027t been dating Franklin Farrell.\"\\n\\n \"I would be extremely surprised,\" Eileen said instantly. \"You know what a reputation he has as a ladies\u0027 man. Idella was very shy.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d have been a real challenge to a Franklin Farrell.\\n\\n \"You heard they questioned Jimmy Hunter?\" Eileen told me suddenly.\\n\\n \"Yes, but I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s guilty.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s got to be someone,\" Eileen said practically. \"Though I hear his alibi for the time Idella was killed is pretty strong.\"\\n\\n \"So there are two stranglers in Lawrenceton, attacking real estate saleswoman?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve heard about copycat killers. Maybe this is one.\"\\n\\n \"What about the thefts?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not the police,\" Eileen said irritably. \"I\u0027m just hoping all this is over and I can go back to my job without being scared every time I have an appointment to meet someone at an empty house.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" I said, instantly contrite. \"I\u0027m a friend of Susu\u0027s, or at least I used to be in high school.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going to come out of this with everyone happy.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. Listen, when do you walk every evening?\"\\n\\n \"Terry and I usually walk at five in the winter, seven in the summer. Did you want to join us?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, how nice of you! No, I\u0027d just slow you down. I thought I might give it a try, but I\u0027d better go by myself at first.\"\\n\\n \"Then be careful.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. See you Saturday night.\"\\n\\n \"Bye.\"\\n\\n I actually found myself a tiny bit regretful I wasn\u0027t going to see Franklin in action. Amina had told me a date with Franklin was like being in a warm, soothing bubble bath. You felt cherished and delicate and pamperable. And of course you wanted that to go on and on, so the date extended very easily into bed. Once or twice, or perhaps even for a month. And then Franklin stopped calling and you had to come back to the real world.\\n\\n If Martin hadn\u0027t happened, I would certainly have accepted, just to sample the experience. I would have stopped short of bed, I told myself firmly.\\n\\n I put out fresh food and water for Madeleine, who was still hiding somewhere in the townhouse, sulking about the great indignity done her at the vet\u0027s.\\n\\n And the phone rang again.\\n\\n This time it was Sally Allison.\\n\\n \"The police searched the Hunters\u0027 house and came up with zilch,\" she said without preamble.\\n\\n \"Oh, thank God. Maybe he\u0027s not such a suspect anymore?\"\\n\\n \"Could be. The afternoon Idella Yates was killed, he was in the hardware store without a break, in full view of at least three people at any given moment. And he says he did look at the Anderton house with Tonia Lee, but on a different day. That\u0027s how his fingerprints got on the night table.\"\\n\\n \"Is it okay for you to be telling me this?\"\\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t tell anyone else. Otherwise, Paul will have my guts for garters.\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re a friend of Susu\u0027s, so I just wanted you to know.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, Sally. Listen, did you ever date Franklin Farrell?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, and laughed. \"I didn\u0027t want to be a clich?. He tries to date you when he thinks you\u0027re especially lonely, or rebounding from a relationship, or if you\u0027re a little stupid. I understand he really wines and dines you before the Big Move, but when he called me, I was too scared I\u0027d join the ranks to accept.\"\\n\\n \"Just wondered.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, did you get that newspaper article I sent you?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, shoot. I forgot to check my mail yesterday. I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s out there. I\u0027ll go see.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. If you don\u0027t get it, call me.\"\\n\\n I reached in my mailbox eagerly and came out with a handful. Yes, here was the article Sally had sent me as she\u0027d promised. There was Martin\u0027s picture. I sighed absurdly. Martin, I read, had a background in agriculture (I assumed that was his being raised on a farm); a distinguished service record, including two purple hearts (that explained the scars I hadn\u0027t yet asked him about); and a long work history with Pan-Am Agra ... a brief chronicle of his steady rise through the ranks followed .. . then a noncommital statement of Martin\u0027s, about his plans for the plant.\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t anything much to it, really, but for some reason it was very exciting to read about my--well, whatever--in the paper. So I read it over. And over.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that strange,\" I said out loud.\\n\\n Martin had mentioned casually to me that he had gotten out of the Army in 1971. This article stated that he\u0027d begun work at Pan-Am Agra in 1973.\\n\\n What had Martin been doing for those two years? I wondered. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/three-bedrooms-one-corpse-aurora-teagarden-3/page-11.html","bookId":2238,"book":{"id":2238,"title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden #3)","description":"Storyline: Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #3) \\n Deciding if she wants to go into real estate becomes a life-or-death choice for Aurora \"Roe\" Teagarden.
