{"id":108296,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"That question had to be asked and answered sooner rather than later, and I stuck my neck out to ask it because I was very interested in the answer.\n But you would have thought I was a policeman with a rubber hose, one who was furthermore holding their kids as hostages.\n \"We have to find out,\" my mother said. \"Someone in this office got that key and put it back on the key board. No one here knew I was going to show the Anderton house this morning. I didn\u0027t know it myself until last night, when Mr. Bartell called me at home. So it was likely the body wouldn\u0027t be found for a long time--how often do we show the Anderton house? Maybe one client in ten can afford a house like that.\"\n For the first time Debbie Lincoln opened her mouth. \"Someone,\" she offered softly, \"could have come in when Patty and me were both gone from the reception area.\"\n Patty shot her a look. \"We\u0027re never supposed to both be gone from the reception area. But there was a period of maybe five minutes this morning when both Debbie and I were not there,\" she admitted. \"While Debbie was in the back copying the sheet for the Blanding house, I had to visit the ladies\u0027 room.\"\n \"I walked through while no one was there,\" Eileen said immediately. \"And I didn\u0027t see anyone coming in from outside.\"\n \"So that narrows the time someone could have come in by a few more seconds,\" I observed.\n Mother said, \"It would have to be someone who knew our system and could find the right hook for the Anderton key very quickly.\"\n \"Every realtor in town knows where our key board is, and that we label every hook alphabetically,\" Mackie said.\n \"So you\u0027re saying whoever returned the key is another realtor, or one of you,\" I pointed out. \"Though I think anyone coming into the office could figure out the key board in seconds. But it does make more sense for a realtor to have returned it, to have realized not having the key on the board would have alerted us much sooner than the key being there. It\u0027s just bad luck for whoever killed Tonia Lee that Martin Bartell wanted to see some big houses this morning, and that he called Mother at home last night after the office was closed.\"\n Again I was aware of my lack of popularity as the people around the table realized they\u0027d just been boxed in.\n \"All right,\" said Patty defensively and illogically, \"where is Tonia Lee\u0027s car? Why wasn\u0027t it at the Anderton house this morning?\"\n That was another interesting question. And one I hadn\u0027t thought of... nor had anyone else in the room.\n \"It\u0027s parked behind Greenhouse Realty,\" said a new voice from the door. \"And wiped clean of fingerprints.\"\n My old buddy Lynn Liggett Smith, making another of her silent entrances.\n \"Your daughter-in-law told me to come on back,\" she told my mother, who had a particularly nasty gleam in her eye. I didn\u0027t think Melinda would be asked to answer the phones anymore.\n Lynn was a tall, slim woman with short brown hair very attractively styled. She wore little or no makeup, always pumps or flats, and plain solid-color suits with bright blouses. Lynn was brave and smart, and sometimes I regretted that because of Arthur we would never be good friends. Lynn was also the only detective specifically designated \"homicide\" at the Lawrenceton police department; she\u0027d served on the Atlanta police force before taking what she thought would be a lower-stress job. She hadn\u0027t counted on Detective Sergeant Jack Burns.\n \"When did you find her car?\" Mother was scrambling to regain her composure.\n \"This afternoon. Mr. Greenhouse knew it was there this morning, but he didn\u0027t think that was important, because he thought Mrs. Greenhouse had driven off in someone else\u0027s car. He just plain didn\u0027t know where Mrs. Greenhouse was, and when she didn\u0027t come home last night, he thought she was just spending the night with someone else. I gather it\u0027s common knowledge she was prone to do that sort of thing.\" Lynn had made a little pun, and she gave me the ghost of a smile.\n \"But today Mr. Knight has told us that Mrs. Greenhouse\u0027s car was in the driveway of the Anderton house last night, so she got there under her own steam. Someone, presumably the murderer, drove that car to Greenhouse Realty and left it there out of sight of the street.\" Lynn cocked her head and scanned our faces.\n The absence of the car would have been noticed by Donnie Greenhouse, just as the absence of the key would have been noticed at our office, sooner or later. But the murderer had had bad luck, no doubt about it.\n \"So,\" Lynn continued, \"who put the key back?\"\n \"My daughter brought that up, too,\" Mother said smoothly. \"We have decided that at one point this morning, early, someone could have entered the reception area without being seen.\"\n \"How long a time would this one point have lasted?\"\n \"Five minutes. Or less,\" Patty Cloud said reluctantly.\n \"No one wants to \u0027fess up, I guess,\" Lynn said hopefully.\n Silence.\n \"Well, I\u0027ll need to talk to each of you separately,\" she said. \"If you all have finished your meeting, perhaps I could just stay in here? I\u0027ll start with you, Mrs. Tea--No, Mrs. Queensland. That okay?\"\n \"Of course,\" Mother said. \"Back to your work, the rest of you. But don\u0027t leave until the detective has a chance to talk to you. Rearrange your appointments.\"\n Beside me Idella Yates sighed. She picked up her briefcase and pushed back her chair. I turned to make some remark and suddenly realized Idella had been crying silently, something I have never mastered. I caught her eye as she dabbed at her cheeks with a handkerchief.\n \"Stupid,\" she said bitterly. Feeling rather puzzled, I watched her leave the room. If Idella and Tonia Lee had been friends, it would have surprised me considerably. And Idella\u0027s reaction seemed a little extreme otherwise.\n I made my own exit wondering where I would wait for my turn with Lynn. My mother\u0027s office, I decided, and started down the hall.\n A young woman was standing in the reception area. I vaguely recognized her as I went through on my way to the left-hand corridor that led to Mother\u0027s office.\n \"Miss Teagarden?\" she said hesitantly. I turned and smiled with equal uncertainty.\n \"I believe I met you at the church last week,\" she said, holding out a slim hand. I jogged my memory.\n \"Oh, of course,\" I said, none too soon. \"Mrs. Kaye.\"\n \"Emily,\" she said, smiling.\n \"Aurora,\" I told her, and to her credit, her smile barely faltered.\n \"Do you work here?\" she asked. \"At Select Realty?\"\n \"Not really,\" I confessed. \"It\u0027s my mother\u0027s agency, and I\u0027m trying to find out a little more about how the business works.\" That was close enough to the truth.\n Emily Kaye was at least five inches taller than I, no great feat. She was slim and small- breasted and dressed in a perfect suburban sweater and skirt and low-heeled shoes ... and her purse matched, too. Her jewelry was small, unobtrusive, but real. Her hair was golden brown and tossed back from her face in a smooth, well-cut mane.\n \"Did you like the church?\" I asked.\n \"Oh, yes, and Father Scott is so nice,\" she said earnestly.\n Huh?\n \"He is so good with children,\" she went on. \"My little girl, Elizabeth, just loves him. He promised he\u0027d take her to the park soon.\"\n He what?\n All my senses went on full alert.\n \"You\u0027re so lucky,\" she said.\n My stare must have made her a bit nervous.\n \"To be dating him,\" she added hastily.\n So she\u0027d been doing some research. I was thinking a number of things, so many that it would have taken a long time to have completed each thought.\n Aubrey loved children? Aubrey had already visited his new parishioner and invited her little girl to the park?\n \"You play the organ, don\u0027t you?\" I said thoughtfully.\n \"Oh, yes. Well, not very well.\" She was lying through her teeth, I just knew it. \"I did play for the church in Macon.\" Suspicion confirmed.\n \"You\u0027re--excuse me, you\u0027re a widow?\"\n \"Yes,\" she said briskly, to get quickly over a painful subject. \"Ken died last year in a car wreck, and it was hard to live in Macon after that. I don\u0027t have any family there, we were there just because of his job ... but I do have an aunt, Cile Vernon, here in Lawrenceton, and she heard there was a teacher\u0027s job available at the kindergarten here, and I was lucky enough to get it. So now I\u0027m house-hunting for a little place for Elizabeth and me.\"\n \"Well, you came to the right realtor,\" I said, trying to brighten up the conversation and not give way to my deep suspicions. I had a feeling that if I looked over Emily Kaye\u0027s shoulder, I would see writing on the wall for my relationship with Father Aubrey Scott.\n \"Yes, Mrs. Yates is so nice. I\u0027m really looking seriously at a little house on Honor right by the junior high school. It\u0027s just a couple of blocks from the kindergarten, and there\u0027s a preschool for my little girl nearby, too. Of course, I\u0027d really like to quit work and stay home with Elizabeth,\" she said wistfully.\n That writing got darker and darker. Sure she would.\n And to top it all off, that was my house, the house I\u0027d inherited from Jane Engle, she was thinking of buying.\n She\u0027d be right across the street from Lynn and Arthur and their baby.\n Aubrey would drop me and fall in love with this organ-playing widow with the cute little girl.\n No, I was being paranoid.\n No, I was being realistic.\n \"Mrs. Kaye,\" Idella\u0027s sweet voice said, just in the nick of time. \"I\u0027m so sorry, we have to rearrange our appointment to see the house again.\"\n \"Oh, and I had my aunt keep Elizabeth just so I could see it by myself!\" Emily Kaye said, regret and accusation mingling in her voice.\n I was battling a tide of rage and self-pity that had torn through me with the force of a monsoon. And I would rather have died than for Emily Kaye to notice that anything was wrong with me.\n \"Why don\u0027t you just go ask Detective Smith if you could run over for a half hour and show the house to Mrs. Kaye?\" I suggested to Idella, who was looking distressed at her client\u0027s disappointment. My voice rang a little hollow in my ears, and I felt my expression probably didn\u0027t match my concerned words, but I was doing the best I could.\n \"I\u0027ll do that,\" Idella said with unaccustomed decision. \"Excuse me just a second.\"\n \"Oh, thanks,\" Emily told me with a warm sincerity that made me want to throw up. \"I hated to ask Aunt Cile to keep Elizabeth this morning. I don\u0027t want her to think I moved here just to have a free babysitter!\"\n \"Think nothing of it,\" I answered with equal sincerity. I wanted to get out of that room so badly my feet were itching. Any minute I was going to slap the tar out of Emily Kaye.\n And why? I asked myself as I gave her a final, civil nod and glided off down the hall to Mother\u0027s office. Because, I answered myself angrily, Emily Kaye was going to get married, she would marry Aubrey, and even if I didn\u0027t want to marry him, I would once again be left. I knew I was being childish, I knew there was nothing logical about my feeling, and still I couldn\u0027t help it. This was not my finest hour.\n It was time for one of my pep talks.\n It is better not to be married than to be married unhappily.\n Women do not need to be married to have rich, fulfilled lives.\n I didn\u0027t want to marry Aubrey anyway, and I probably wouldn\u0027t have accepted if Arthur Smith had asked me. (Well, yes I would, but it would\u0027ve been a mistake.)\n All relationships fail until you find the right one. It\u0027s inevitable.\n The failure of a relationship to lead to marriage does not mean you are unworthy or unattractive.\n Having told myself all this, I recited the list again.\n By the time Mother returned to her office, I\u0027d completed the circuit three times. Mother was not in the best of humor, either. She was fuming about the disruption of the office, about being questioned again by the police, about the nerve of Tonia Lee, turning up dead in a Select Realty listing. Of course, she didn\u0027t use those words, but that was the gist of her diatribe.\n \"Oh, listen to me!\" she said suddenly. \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m going on like this, and a woman I know is probably lying on a table somewhere waiting to be autopsied.\" She shook her head at her own lack of empathy. \"We\u0027ll just have to put up with all this. I wasn\u0027t crazy about Tonia Lee, God knows, but no one should have to go through what she must have.\"\n \"You did tell Lynn about the thefts?\"\n \"Yes. I let her draw her own conclusions. I\u0027d already told her about the vases missing from the Anderton house. So I went on and told her about the pilfering that\u0027s been going on. Of course, it\u0027s more than pilfering. Someone in our little group of realtors is seriously dishonest.\" \"Mom, have you happened to think that Tonia Lee found out who stole the stuff from the houses? That maybe that was why she got killed?\"\n \"Yes. Of course. I hope the thefts had nothing to do with the murder.\"\n \"That would mean that a realtor is the killer.\"\n \"Yes. Let\u0027s just drop the subject. We don\u0027t know anything. It was probably one of Tonia Lee\u0027s conquests that did her in.\"\n \"Probably. Well, I\u0027m going to go home as soon as Lynn talks to me.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have a feel for the business, do you?\" Mother said reluctantly.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said with equal regret.\n She reached across her desk and patted my hand, surprising me for the second time today. We are not touchers.\n \"Excuse me,\" Debbie Lincoln said from the doorway. \"That woman wants you, Miss Teagarden.\"\n \"Thanks,\" I said. I retrieved my purse from the floor and fluttered my fingers at my mother. \"See you tomorrow night, Mom, if not sooner.\"\n \"Okay, Aurora.\"\n That night, after I\u0027d taken my shower and wrapped myself up in a warm robe, something that had been picking at the edges of my mind finally surfaced.\n I looked up a number in the little Lawrenceton phone book and dialed.\n \"Hello?\"\n \"Gerald, this is Roe Teagarden.\"\n \"My goodness, girl. I haven\u0027t seen you in a year, I guess.\"\n \"How are you doing, Gerald?\"\n \"Oh, pretty well. You know, don\u0027t you, that I\u0027ve remarried?\"\n \"That\u0027s what I heard. Congratulations.\"\n \"Mamie\u0027s cousin Marietta came to help me clean out her stuff after Mamie--died, and we just hit it off.\"\n \"I\u0027m so glad, Gerald.\"\n \"Is there anything I can do for you, Roe?\"\n \"Listen, I heard a name today and I\u0027m trying to pin a case to it. Think you can help me?\"\n \"I\u0027ll sure give it a shot. It\u0027s been a long time since I\u0027ve read any true crime. Mamie getting killed kind of made my interest in crime fade ...\"\n \"Of course. I\u0027m being so stupid calling you ...\"\n \"But lately I\u0027ve thought about taking it up again. So what\u0027s your question?\"\n \"You were always our walking encyclopedia in Real Murders, Gerald. So here\u0027s the question. Emily Kaye?\"\n \"Emily Kaye ... hmmmm. A victim, not a killer, I remember that right off the bat.\"\n \"Okay. American?\"\n \"Nope. Nope. English ... early this century, 1920s, I think.\"\n I kept a respectful silence while Gerald rummaged through his mental attic of old murder cases. Since Gerald was an insurance salesman, his interest in wrongful death had always seemed rather natural.\n \"I got it!\" he said triumphantly. \"Patrick Mahon! Married man who killed and cut up his mistress, Emily Kaye. There were pieces of her all over the holiday cottage he\u0027d rented; he\u0027d tried several methods to dispose of the body. He\u0027d bought a knife and saw before he\u0027d gone down to the cottage, so the jury didn\u0027t believe his excuse that she\u0027d died accidentally. Let me flip open this book, Roe. Okay ... his wife, who\u0027d thought he was fooling around, found a ticket to retrieve a bag from the train station . .. and in the bag was a woman\u0027s bloodstained clothing. She told the police, I believe. So they backtracked Mahon and found the body parts. That what you needed to know?\"\n \"Yes, thank you, Gerald. I appreciate your help.\"\n \"No trouble at all.\"\n The early Emily Kaye was certainly a far cry from the present-day Emily. I couldn\u0027t imagine the Emily I knew going to a cottage for an illicit vacation with a married man.\n So a little niggling point had been settled. I knew where I\u0027d heard the name.\n But there was no one I could share this fascinating bit of information with, no one who would appreciate it. For the second time in one day, I regretted the disbanding of Real Murders. Call us ghouls, call us just plain peculiar, we had had a good time with our admittedly offbeat hobby. What had happened to the members of our little club? Of the twelve, one would go on trial soon for multiple murder, another had committed suicide, one had been murdered, one had been widowed, one had died of natural causes, one had been arrested for drug trafficking (Gifford\u0027s unusual lifestyle had finally attracted the wrong attention), one was in a mental institution ... on the other hand, LeMaster was still busy and prosperous with his dry-cleaning business, presumably, though I hadn\u0027t seen him since Jane Engle\u0027s funeral. John Queensland had married my mother. Gerald had remarried. Arthur Smith had gotten married. And I...\n It seemed LeMaster Cane and I were the only ones who were basically unchanged in life condition in the eighteen months or so since Real Murders had had its last meeting. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/three-bedrooms-one-corpse-aurora-teagarden-3/page-3.html","bookId":2238,"book":{"id":2238,"title":"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Three Bedrooms, One Corpse (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #3) \n Deciding if she wants to go into real estate becomes a life-or-death choice for Aurora \"Roe\" Teagarden.
