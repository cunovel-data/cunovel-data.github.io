There\u0027s a sheer drop over the wall. Follow me!\u0027\\n\\n Down the road from the gate they fled. In fifty paces, with a swift bend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from the Tower. They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back against the rock they drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. Perching now on the wall beside the ruined gate the Nazg\u0026ucirc;l sent out its deadly cries. All the cliffs echoed.\\n\\n In terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the Tower. As they flitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement; then they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the Morgul-road. They came to the way-meeting. There was still no sign of orcs, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazg\u0026ucirc;l; but they knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt would begin.\\n\\n \u0027This won\u0027t do, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027If we were real orcs, we ought to be dashing back to the Tower, not running away. The first enemy we meet will know us. We must get off this road somehow.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we can\u0027t,\u0027 said Sam, \u0027not without wings.\u0027\\n\\n The eastern faces of the Ephel Duath were sheer, falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner ridge. A short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying bridge of stone leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam dashed along the bridge; but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the mountain-side, loomed the Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. Suddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shattering peal. Horns sounded. And now from beyond the bridge-end came answering cries. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of Orodruin, Frodo and Sam could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs.\\n\\n \u0027Quick, Sam! Over we go!\u0027 cried Frodo. They scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge. Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall.\\n\\n \u0027Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Good-bye!\u0027\\n\\n He let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than a dozen feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny bushes. There Sam lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.\\n\\n When the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper. \u0027Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn\u0027t know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I had a\u0027known, this is just what I\u0027d have looked for. These thorns must be a foot long by the feel of them; they\u0027ve stuck through everything I\u0027ve got on. Wish I\u0027d a\u0027put that mail-shirt on!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Orc-mail doesn\u0027t keep these thorns out,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Not even a leather jerkin is any good.\u0027\\n\\n They had a struggle to get out of the thicket. The thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last.\\n\\n \u0027Now down we go, Sam,\u0027 Frodo whispered. \u0027Down into the valley quick, and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.\u0027\\n\\n Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of Mordor the Sun was climbing over the eastern rim of Middle-earth; but here all was still dark as night. The Mountain smouldered and its fires went out. The glare faded from the cliffs. The easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they left Ithilien now seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.\\n\\n At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a boulder. Both were sweating. \u0027If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water, I\u0027d shake his hand,\u0027 said Sam.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t say such things!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027It only makes it worse.\u0027 Then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was asleep. \u0027Wake up, Sam!\u0027 he said. \u0027Come on! It\u0027s time we made another effort.\u0027\\n\\n Sam scrambled to his feet. \u0027Well I never!\u0027 he said. \u0027I must have dropped off. It\u0027s a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my eyes just closed down on their own.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine. But presently he stopped again.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s no good, Sam,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t manage it. This mail-shirt, I mean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when I was tired. This is far heavier. And what\u0027s the use of it? We shan\u0027t win through by fighting.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But we may have some to do,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027And there\u0027s knives and stray arrows. That Gollum isn\u0027t dead, for one thing. I don\u0027t like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look here, Sam dear lad,\u0027 said Frodo, \u0027I am tired, weary, I haven\u0027t a hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the Mountain, as long as I can move. The Ring is enough. This extra weight is killing me. It must go. But don\u0027t think I\u0027m ungrateful. I hate to think of the foul work you must have had among the bodies to find it for me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk about it, Mr. Frodo. Bless you! I\u0027d carry you on my back, if I could. Let it go then!\u0027\\n\\n Frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. He shivered a little. \u0027What I really need is something warm,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s gone cold, or else I\u0027ve caught a chill.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can have my cloak, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam. He unslung his pack and took out the elven-cloak. \u0027How\u0027s this, Mr. Frodo?\u0027 he said. \u0027You wrap that orc-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. Then this can go over all. It don\u0027t look quite orc-fashion, but it\u0027ll keep you warmer; and I daresay it\u0027ll keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by the Lady.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. \u0027That\u0027s better!\u0027 he said. \u0027I feel much lighter. I can go on now. But this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart. As I lay in prison, Sam. I tried to remember the Brandywine, and Woody End, and The Water running through the mill at Hobbiton. But I can\u0027t see them now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There now, Mr. Frodo, it\u0027s you that\u0027s talking of water this time!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027If only the Lady could see us or hear us, I\u0027d say to her: \"Your Ladyship, all we want is light and water; just clean water and plain daylight, better than any jewels, begging your pardon.\" But it\u0027s a long way to Lorien.\u0027 Sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights of the Ephel Duath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.\\n\\n They started off again. They had not gone far when Frodo paused. \u0027There\u0027s a Black Rider over us,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can feel it. We had better keep still for a while.\u0027\\n\\n Crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not speak for some time. Then Frodo breathed a sigh of relief. \u0027It\u0027s passed,\u0027 he said. They stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away to their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and high ridges of the great range began to appear dark and black, visible shapes. Light was growing behind them. Slowly it crept towards the North. There was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. The billowing clouds of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison.\\n\\n \u0027Look at it, Mr. Frodo!\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Look at it! The wind\u0027s changed. Something\u0027s happening. He\u0027s not having it all his own way. His darkness is breaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!\u0027\\n\\n It was the morning of the fifteenth of March, and over the Vale of Anduin the Sun was rising above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind was blowing. Theoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields.\\n\\n As Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the line of the Ephel Duath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed out of the West, at first only a black speck against the glimmering strip above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill cry, the voice of a Nazg\u0026ucirc;l; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord of the Ring-wraiths had met his doom.\\n\\n \u0027What did I tell you? Something\u0027s happening!\u0027 cried Sam. \u0027\"The war\u0027s going well,\" said Shagrat; but Gorbag he wasn\u0027t so sure. And he was right there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven\u0027t you got some hope now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well no, not much, Sam,\u0027 Frodo sighed. \u0027That\u0027s away beyond the mountains. We\u0027re going east not west. And I\u0027m so tired. And the Ring is so heavy, Sam. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire.\u0027\\n\\n Sam\u0027s quick spirits sank again at once. He looked at his master anxiously, and he took his hand. \u0027Come, Mr. Frodo!\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ve got one thing I wanted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I guess it\u0027s dangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we\u0027ll lie close and have a rest. But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the Elves\u0027 food; it may hearten you.\u0027\\n\\n Sharing a wafer of lembas, and munching it as best they could with their parched mouths. Frodo and Sam plodded on. The light, though no more than a grey dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its bottom went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. Beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs. Had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it was a track that left the main Morgul-road at the western bridge-end and went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley\u0027s bottom. It was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of Isenmouthe, the iron jaws of Carach Angren.\\n\\n It was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed speed, and Frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders or in the trackless glens of the Morgai. And he judged that northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them to take. The road east to the plain, or the pass back westward, those they would first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last desperate stage of his journey. So now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path, and for some time they marched along it. The cliffs at their left were overhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the path made many bends, and at each bend they gripped their sword-hilts and went forward cautiously.\\n\\n The light grew no stronger, for Orodruin was still belching forth a great fume that, beaten upwards by the opposing airs, mounted higher and higher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view. They had trudged for more than an hour when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out of a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came dripping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the Black Land and wander fruitless down into the dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones.\\n\\n Sam sprang towards it. \u0027If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!\u0027 he cried. \u0027Light and now water!\u0027 Then he stopped. \u0027Let me drink first Mr. Frodo,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027All right, but there\u0027s room enough for two.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t mean that,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027I mean: if it\u0027s poisonous, or something that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, master, if you understand me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I do. But I think we\u0027ll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing. Still, be careful now, if it\u0027s very cold!\u0027\\n\\n The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank their fill, and Sam replenished his water-bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on for several miles, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold.\\n\\n \u0027This is where we turn aside, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027And we must turn east.\u0027 He sighed as he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley. \u0027I have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there. And then I must rest a little.\u0027\\n\\n The river-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled down to it, and began to cross it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed by threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley. Upon its outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying land, but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, struggling for life. In the glens of the Morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the stones, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their maggot-ridden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, marked like orcs with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled.\\n\\n \u0027Orc-gear\u0027s no good,\u0027 said Sam, waving his arms. \u0027I wish I\u0027d got an orc\u0027s hide!\u0027\\n\\n At last Frodo could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight of the last craggy ridge. \u0027I must rest now, Sam, and sleep if I can.\u0027 said Frodo. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country. At length, tired out, they slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock-face.\\n\\n There they sat and made such a meal as they could. Keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained in Sam\u0027s bag of Faramir\u0027s provision: some dried fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in the air of Mordor that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of Gorgoroth to cross.\\n\\n \u0027Now you go to sleep first, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s getting dark again. I reckon this day is nearly over.\u0027\\n\\n Frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. Sam struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo\u0027s hand; and there he sat silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the Ephel Duath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo\u0027s side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.\\n\\n They woke together, hand in hand. Sam was almost fresh, ready for another day; but Frodo sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden one stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless, bare, jagged, barren as a slate.\\n\\n After much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb, and with a last hundred feet of clawing scramble they were up. They came to a cleft between two dark crags, and passing through found themselves on the very edge of the last fence of Mordor. Below them, at the bottom of a fall of some fifteen hundred feet, lay the inner plain stretching away into a formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind of the world blew now from the West, and the great clouds were lifted high, floating away eastward; but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth.\\n\\n Still far away, forty miles at least, they saw Mount Doom, its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now dimmed, and it stood in smouldering slumber, as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast. Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of Barad-dur that was reared far way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains thrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in thought, and the Eye turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a bright sword, and a stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.\\n\\n Frodo and Sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered how the Lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies. Yet armies he had. As far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and away southward, there were camps, some of tents, some ordered like small towns. One of the largest of these was right below them. Barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it south-east to join the Morgul-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t like the look of things at all,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Pretty hopeless, I call it �C saving that where there\u0027s such a lot of folk there must be wells or water, not to mention food. And these are Men not Orcs, or my eyes are all wrong.\u0027\\n\\n Neither he nor Frodo knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark sad waters of Lake Nurnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves. Here in the northward regions were the mines and forges, and the musterings of long-planned war; and here the Dark Power, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathering them together. Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, had been checked upon its western line, southward and northward. For the moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing them about Cirith Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to defend the Mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more.\\n\\n \u0027Well!\u0027 Sam went on. \u0027Whatever they have to eat and drink, we can\u0027t get it. There\u0027s no way down that I can see. And we couldn\u0027t cross all that open country crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Still we shall have to try,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027It\u0027s no worse than I expected. I never hoped to get across. I can\u0027t see any hope of it now. But I\u0027ve still got to do the best I can. At present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible. So we must still go northwards, I think, and see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I guess what it\u0027ll be like,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Where it\u0027s narrower the Orcs and Men will just be packed closer. You\u0027ll see, Mr. Frodo.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I dare say I shall, if we ever get so far,\u0027 said Frodo and turned away.\\n\\n They soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the crest of the Morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylls. In the end they were forced to go back down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley. It was rough going, for they dared not cross over to the path on the westward side. After a mile or more they saw, huddled in a hollow at the cliff\u0027s foot, the orc-hold that they had guessed was near at hand: a wall and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no movement to be seen, but the hobbits crept by cautiously, keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly at this point along both sides of the old water-course.\\n\\n They went two or three miles further, and the orc-hold was hidden from sight behind them; but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc-voices. Quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush. The voices drew nearer. Presently two orcs came into view. One was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn; it was of a small breed, black-skinned, with wide and snuffling nostrils: evidently a tracker of some kind. The other was a big fighting-orc, like those of Shagrat\u0027s company, bearing the token of the Eye. He also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad-headed spear. As usual they were quarrelling, and being of different breeds they used the Common Speech after their fashion.\\n\\n Hardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped. \u0027Nar!\u0027 it snarled. \u0027I\u0027m going home.\u0027 It pointed across the valley to the orc-hold. \u0027No good wearing my nose out on stones any more. There\u0027s not a trace left, I say. I\u0027ve lost the scent through giving way to you. It went up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not much use are you, you little snufflers?\u0027 said the big orc. \u0027I reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then what have you seen with them?\u0027 snarled the other. \u0027Garn! You don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re looking for.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whose blame\u0027s that?\u0027 said the soldier. \u0027Not mine. That comes from Higher Up. First they say it\u0027s a great Elf in bright armour, then it\u0027s a sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk-hai; or maybe it\u0027s all the lot together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ar!\u0027 said the tracker. \u0027They\u0027ve lost their heads, that\u0027s what it is. And some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I hear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your lads done in, and prisoner got away. If that\u0027s the way you fighters go on, small wonder there\u0027s bad news from the battles.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who says there\u0027s bad news?\u0027 shouted the soldier.\\n\\n \u0027Ar! Who says there isn\u0027t?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s cursed rebel-talk, and I\u0027ll stick you, if you don\u0027t shut it down, see?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, all right!\u0027 said the tracker. \u0027I\u0027ll say no more and go on thinking. But what\u0027s the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler with the flapping hands?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Nothing, maybe. But he\u0027s up to no good, nosing around, I\u0027ll wager. Curse him! No sooner had he slipped us and run off than word came he\u0027s wanted alive, wanted quick.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I hope they get him and put him through it,\u0027 growled the tracker. \u0027He messed up the scent back there, pinching that cast-off mail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round the place before I could get there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It saved his life anyhow,\u0027 said the soldier. \u0027Why, before I knew he was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty paces right in the back; but he ran on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Garn! You missed him,\u0027 said the tracker. \u0027First you shoot wild, then you run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. I\u0027ve had enough of you.\u0027 He loped off.\\n\\n \u0027You come back,\u0027 shouted the soldier, \u0027or I\u0027ll report you!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won\u0027t be captain any more.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll give your name and number to the Nazg\u0026ucirc;l,\u0027 said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss. \u0027One of them\u0027s in charge at the Tower now.\u0027\\n\\n The other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage. \u0027You cursed peaching sneakthief!\u0027 he yelled. \u0027You can\u0027t do your job, and you can\u0027t even stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the flesh off you! If the enemy doesn\u0027t get them first. They\u0027ve done in Number One, I\u0027ve heard, and I hope it\u0027s true!\u0027\\n\\n The big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing behind a stone, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared.\\n\\n For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length Sam stirred. \u0027Well I call that neat as neat,\u0027 he said. \u0027If this nice friendliness would spread about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quietly, Sam,\u0027 Frodo whispered. \u0027There may be others about. We have evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to every corner of it. Orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. But you can\u0027t get much hope out of it. They hate us far more, altogether and all the time. If those two had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.\u0027\\n\\n There was another long silence. Sam broke it again, but with a whisper this time. \u0027Did you hear what they said about that gobbler, Mr. Frodo? I told you Gollum wasn\u0027t dead yet, didn\u0027t I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I remember. And I wondered how you knew,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Well come now! I think we had better not move out from here again, until it has gone quite dark. So you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. If you can do it quietly.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try,\u0027 said Sam, \u0027but when I think of that Stinker I get so hot l could shout.\u0027\\n\\n There the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny bush, while the drear light of Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and Sam spoke into Frodo\u0027s ear all that he could find words for of Gollum\u0027s treacherous attack, the horror of Shelob, and his own adventures with the orcs. When he had finished, Frodo said nothing but took Sam\u0027s hand and pressed it. At length he stirred.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I suppose we must be going on again,\u0027 he said. \u0027I wonder how long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will be over, and in vain.\u0027 He stood up. \u0027It\u0027s dark, and we cannot use the Lady\u0027s glass. Keep it safe for me, Sam. I have nowhere to keep it now, except in my hand, and I shall need both hands in the blind night. But Sting I give to you. I have got an orc-blade, but I do not think it will be my part to strike any blow again.\u0027\\n\\n It was difficult and dangerous moving in the night in the pathless land; but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on hour by hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light crept back over the western heights, long after day had opened in the lands beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his times of waking Sam was busy with thoughts of food. At last when Frodo roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, he asked the question that was troubling him most.\\n\\n \u0027Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 he said, \u0027but have you any notion how far there is still to go?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, not any clear notion, Sam,\u0027 Frodo answered. \u0027In Rivendell before I set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came back here; but I only remember it vaguely. I remember clearest that there was a place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge back by the Tower. It might be a good point at which to cross. But of course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, sixty miles from it, I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north from the bridge now. Even if all goes well, I could hardly reach the Mountain in a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the burden will get very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.\u0027\\n\\n Sam sighed. \u0027That\u0027s just as I feared,\u0027 he said. \u0027Well, to say nothing of water, we\u0027ve got to eat less, Mr. Frodo, or else move a bit quicker, at any rate while we\u0027re still in this valley. One more bite and all the food\u0027s ended, save the Elves\u0027 waybread.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll try and be a bit quicker, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo, drawing a deep breath. \u0027Come on then! Let\u0027s start another march!\u0027\\n\\n It was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night. The hours passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the first hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone.\\n\\n Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the upper airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles about them. The trough between the mountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more than a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel Duath; but to the east it fell as sheerly as ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water-course came to an end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high barren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; and between the ends there was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, beyond which lay the deep dale of Udun. In that dale behind the Morannon were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for the defence of the Black Gate of their land; and there now their Lord was gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the West. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires burned; and all across the gap an earth-wall had been raised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge.\\n\\n A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched away from the main range, stood the old castle of Durthang, now one of the many orc-holds that clustered about the dale of Udun. A road, already visible in the growing light, came winding down from it, until only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and on to the Isenmouthe.\\n\\n To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of Carach Angren.\\n\\n \u0027We have come to a dead end, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027If we go on, we shall only come up to that orc-tower, but the only road to take is that road that comes down from it �C unless we go back. We can\u0027t climb up westward, or climb down eastward.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then we must take the road, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027We must take it and chance our luck, if there is any luck in Mordor. We might as well give ourselves up as wander about any more, or try to go back. Our food won\u0027t last. We\u0027ve got to make a dash for it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All right, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Lead me! As long as you\u0027ve got any hope left. Mine is gone. But I can\u0027t dash, Sam. I\u0027ll just plod along after you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food, Mr. Frodo. Come and take what you can get of them!\u0027\\n\\n He gave Frodo water and an additional wafer of the waybread, and he made a pillow of his cloak for his master\u0027s head. Frodo was too weary to debate the matter, and Sam did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water, and eaten Sam\u0027s share of the food as well as his own. When Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned his face. It was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid. \u0027Well, here goes, Master!\u0027 Sam muttered to himself. \u0027I\u0027ll have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we\u0027ll get no further.\u0027\\n\\n Sam crept out, and flitting from stone to stone with more than hobbit-care, he went down to the water-course, and then followed it for some way as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps where long ago, no doubt, its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall. All now seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling. Clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the hill-side and filled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then under the barren stones.\\n\\n Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo\u0027s hiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the spring and ran, jumping from stone to stone. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. Sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it, peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.\\n\\n \u0027Well, luck did not let me down,\u0027 muttered Sam, \u0027but that was a near thing! Isn\u0027t it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been shot!\u0027 He sat down by Frodo and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself. At last when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened Frodo gently.\\n\\n \u0027That Gollum\u0027s about again, I\u0027m afraid, Mr. Frodo,\u0027 he said. \u0027Leastways, if it wasn\u0027t him, then there\u0027s two of him. I went away to find some water and spied him nosing round just as I turned back. I reckon it isn\u0027t safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but I can\u0027t hold up my lids much longer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bless you, Sam!\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027Lie down and take your proper turn! But I\u0027d rather have Gollum than orcs. At any rate he won\u0027t give us away to them �C not unless he\u0027s caught himself.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,\u0027 growled Sam. \u0027Keep your eyes open, Mr. Frodo! There\u0027s a bottle full of water. Drink up. We can fill it again when we go on.\u0027 With that Sam plunged into sleep.\\n\\n Light was fading when he woke. Frodo sat propped against the rock behind, but he had fallen asleep. The water-bottle was empty. There was no sign of Gollum.\\n\\n Mordor-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the heights burned fierce and red, when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all their journey. They went first to the little spring, and then climbing warily up they came to the road at the point where it swung east towards the Isenmouthe twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and it had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace.\\n\\n After doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short way back the road had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They rested for some minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness of the night they heard the sound that all along they had secretly dreaded: the noise of marching feet. It was still some way behind them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away, and they were moving fast: too fast for Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead.\\n\\n \u0027I feared it, Sam,\u0027 said Frodo. \u0027We\u0027ve trusted to luck, and it has failed us. We\u0027re trapped.\u0027 He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of gloom. \u0027We\u0027re trapped at last!\u0027 he said. He sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head.\\n\\n \u0027Seems so,\u0027 said Sam. \u0027Well, we can but wait and see.\u0027 And with that he sat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff.\\n\\n They did not have to wait long. The orcs were going at a great pace. Those in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet.\\n\\n \u0027If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on!\u0027 he thought.\\n\\n And so it seemed that they would. The leading orcs came loping along, panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord\u0027s wars; all they cared for was to get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. Sam held his breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures by the road-side. He flicked a whip at them and yelled: \u0027Hi, you! Get up!\u0027 They did not answer, and with a shout he halted the whole company.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, you slugs!\u0027 he cried. \u0027This is no time for slouching.\u0027 He took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields. \u0027Deserting, eh?\u0027 he snarled. \u0027Or thinking of it? All your folk should have been inside Udun before yesterday evening. You know that. Up you get and fall in, or I\u0027ll have your numbers and report you.\u0027\\n\\n They struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. \u0027No, not at the rear!\u0027 the slave-driver shouted. \u0027Three files up. And stay there, or you\u0027ll know it, when I come down the line!\u0027 He sent his long whip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again at a brisk trot.\\n\\n It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired as he was; but for Frodo it was a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. The stench of the sweating orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There was no hope of falling out unseen: Now and again the orc-driver fell back and jeered at them.\\n\\n \u0027There now!\u0027 he laughed, flicking at their legs. \u0027Where there\u0027s a whip there\u0027s a will, my slugs. Hold up! I\u0027d give you a nice freshener now, only you\u0027ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your camp. Do you good. Don\u0027t you know we\u0027re at war?\u0027\\n\\n They had gone some miles, and the road was at last running down a long slope into the plain, when Frodo\u0027s strength began to give out and his will wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. \u0027I\u0027ll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,\u0027 he thought.\\n\\n Then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there came an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to Udun. Some way in front of it, before the gate at the bridge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the south, and from Barad-dur. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the Captains of the West were advancing and the Dark Lord was speeding his forces north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. At once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march. Though the drivers yelled and plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. A troop of heavy-armed uruks from Barad-dur charged into the Durthang line and threw them into confusion.\\n\\n Dazed as he was with pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging Frodo down with him. Orcs fell over them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of the road. It had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog, and it was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.\\n\\n They lay still for a while. It was too dark to seek for cover, if indeed there was any to find; but Sam felt that they ought at least to get further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light.\\n\\n \u0027Come on, Mr. Frodo!\u0027 he whispered. \u0027One more crawl, and then you can lie still.\u0027\\n\\n With a last despairing effort Frodo raised himself on his hands, and struggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-of-the-king-the-lord-of-the-rings-3/page-11.html","bookId":1542,"book":{"id":1542,"title":"The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings #3)","description":"Storyline: The Return of the King (The Lord of the Rings #3) \\n Concluding the story begun in The Hobbit, this is the final part of Tolkien\u0027s epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings. \\n The armies of the Dark Lord are massing as his evil shadow spreads ever wider.
