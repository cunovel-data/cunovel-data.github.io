{"id":76560,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Her shadow, a handsome soldier named Anthony, muttered over the distance. He had suggested they ride, but Madelyne was against the plan, forcing the soldier to walk beside her. She told him the walk would do them good, when in fact she hoped to hide her lack of riding skills. When Madelyne returned from her chore, Duncan was waiting for her. He didn\u0027t look too pleased. \"You weren\u0027t given permission to go outside the walls,\" he stated quite emphatically. Anthony came to her defense. \"You did give her permission to feed the animals,\" he reminded his lord. \"Aye, you did,\" Madelyne agreed, and with such a sweet smile and soft voice, she was certain he thought her most composed. Duncan nodded his head. The look on his face was chilling. Madelyne thought he wished he was rid of her. Yet he didn\u0027t even yell at her now. In truth, he rarely raised his voice. He didn\u0027t have to. Duncan\u0027s size gained immediate attention, and his expression, when he was as displeased as he was now, seemed just as effective as any bellow. Madelyne wasn\u0027t afraid of him anymore. Unfortunately, she had to remind herself of that fact several times a day. And she still didn\u0027t have enough courage to ask him what he\u0027d meant by telling her she now belonged to him. She kept putting that confrontation off, in truth fearing what his answer would be. Besides, she told herself, there\u0027d be time enough after Adela was feeling better to find out her own destiny. For the time being, she\u0027d attack each battle as it presented itself. \"I only walked to the top of the hill,\" Madelyne finally answered. \"Are you worried that I\u0027ll just keep on walking until I\u0027ve reached London?\" \"What is the point of this walk?\" Duncan asked, ignoring her comment about escape. He thought it too ludicrous to respond to. \"To feed my wolf.\" His reaction was most satisfactory. For once he wasn\u0027t able to keep his expression contained. He was looking at her in astonishment. Madelyne smiled. \"You may laugh if you\u0027ve a mind to, but I saw either a very large dog or a wild wolf, and I did feel it was my duty to feed him, just until the weather improves and he can hunt again. Of course, it will mean an entire winter ahead to see to his food, but come next spring, with the first warm breeze, I\u0027m certain my wolf will be able to fend for himself.\" Duncan turned his back on Madelyne and walked away. Madelyne felt like laughing. He hadn\u0027t denied her walks outside his fortress, and that was victory enough to gloat over. In truth, Madelyne didn\u0027t think the wild dog was in the area any longer. She looked out her window every night since first sighting the animal, but he was never there. The dog had left, and sometimes, late at night when she was huddled under the covers, she\u0027d wonder if she\u0027d really seen the animal or if he\u0027d just been a figment of her overactive imagination. Madelyne would never admit that to Duncan, however, and gained perverse pleasure each time she walked across the drawbridge. The food she had left the day before was always gone, indicating that there were animals feeding during the night. She was happy knowing the food wasn\u0027t wasted. And she was even happier vexing Duncan. Aye, she did it just to irritate him. And from the way Duncan avoided her, she thought she had succeeded. The days would have been enjoyable if Madelyne hadn\u0027t had to worry about the dinner hours. That did put a weight on her shoulders and a strain on her gentle nature. She stayed outside as much as possible, ignoring the rain and the cold. Gerty had given her cast-off clothing that had belonged to Duncan\u0027s older sister, Catherine. The garments were too large, but Madelyne put her needle and thread to them and the result was more than adequate for her needs. She didn\u0027t care if she was fashionable. The clothes were faded but clean, and felt soft against her skin. Most important, they kept her warm. Each afternoon Madelyne walked to the stables with a clump of sugar to give to Duncan\u0027s stallion, the white beauty she\u0027d named Silenus. She and the horse had formed a bond of sorts. The stallion would set up a terrible fuss, pretending to try to knock the wooden stall apart whenever he caught sight of Madelyne approaching. Yet as soon as she spoke to him, Silenus would settle down. Madelyne understood the animal\u0027s need to show off for her, and she always praised his spirit after giving him his treat. Silenus, for all his size, was becoming affectionate. He\u0027d nudge her hand until she petted him, and when she\u0027d stop and rest her hand on the railing, a trick to gain a reaction, Silenus would immediately nudge her hand back on his head. The stablemaster didn\u0027t like Madelyne visiting and stated his opinion loud enough for her to hear. He also thought she spoiled Duncan\u0027s horse and even threatened to tell the lord what she was up to. He was all bluster though. Aye, the stablemaster was amazed by Madelyne\u0027s gifted way with the horse. He was still a wee bit nervous whenever he saddled Duncan\u0027s stallion, but this mite of a girl didn\u0027t seem the least afraid. On the third afternoon, the stablemaster spoke to Madelyne, and by week\u0027s end, they were fast friends. His name was James, Madelyne learned, and he was married to Maude. Their son, William, was still attached to his mama\u0027s skirts, but James was patiently awaiting the time when the boy would be old enough to become apprentice under him. The child would follow tradition, James explained with an air of importance. \"Silenus would let you ride him bareback,\" James announced after he\u0027d given Madelyne a tour of his domain. Madelyne smiled. James had accepted her name for Duncan\u0027s mount. \"I\u0027ve never ridden bareback,\" she said. \" \u0027Tis the truth, James, that I\u0027ve not ridden much at all.\" \"Perhaps,\" James suggested with a kind smile, \"when the rain eases a bit, you could learn the proper way.\" Madelyne nodded. \"Now, if you\u0027ve never learned, how\u0027d you get from one place to the next, I\u0027m wondering,\" James admitted. \"I walked,\" Madelyne told him. She laughed over his look of surprise. \" \u0027Tis not a sin I\u0027m confessing.\" \"I\u0027ve a gentle mare you could start your practicing with,\" he suggested. \"Nay, I think not,\" Madelyne answered. \"Silenus wouldn\u0027t like that much. I think his feelings might be injured, and we can\u0027t allow that, now, can we?\" \"We can\u0027t?\" James looked confused. \"I\u0027ll do well enough with Silenus.\" \"\u0027Tis the lord\u0027s stallion you\u0027re wanting to ride, milady?\" James stammered. He sounded as if he were strangling. \"I know whom he belongs to,\" Madelyne returned. \"Don\u0027t concern yourself over the animal\u0027s size,\" she said, trying to ease the incredulous look off his face. \"I\u0027ve ridden Silenus before.\" \"But do you have the lord\u0027s permission?\" \"I shall gain it, James.\" Madelyne smiled again, and all the logical arguments went right out of the stablemaster\u0027s mind. Aye, he told himself, from the look in her pretty blue eyes and the way she smiled up at him so trustingly, James suddenly found himself in complete agreement. When Madelyne left the stable, the guard walked beside her. He was a constant reminder to her and to everyone else that she was not an invited guest. Anthony\u0027s attitude toward her had softened considerably though. He wasn\u0027t nearly as irritated by his duty. From the way Anthony was greeted by the other soldiers, Madelyne surmised he was well thought of. He had an attractive smile, a boyish grin it was, which was at great odds with his size and age. She couldn\u0027t understand why he\u0027d been ordered to watch her, thinking that someone of lesser stature, such as Ansel, the squire, would have been better suited for the placid duty. Her curiosity increased, until she finally decided to question him. \"Have you done something to displease your lord?\" Anthony didn\u0027t seem to understand her question. \"When the soldiers return from their work, I can see the envious way you watch them, Anthony. You\u0027d like to be training with them instead of walking with me in circles.\" \"\u0027Tis no trouble,\" Anthony protested. \"Still, I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027ve been given this duty unless you\u0027ve displeased Duncan some way.\" \"I\u0027ve an injury needing to heal a bit more.\" Anthony explained. His voice was hesitant, and Madelyne noticed the blush that slowly crept up from his neck. She thought it most odd that he would be embarrassed. Seeking only to put him at ease, she said, \"I\u0027ve also suffered an injury, and not too mild, I can tell you that.\" It did sound like a boast, but her goal was to make Anthony realize he had nothing to be ashamed of. \"Almost did me in, Anthony, but Edmond took care of me. I\u0027ve a horrid scar now, down the length of my thigh.\" Anthony continued to look uncomfortable with their topic. \"Don\u0027t soldiers think it noble when they\u0027re injured in battle?\" Madelyne asked. \"They do,\" Anthony answered. He clasped his hands behind his back and increased his pace. It suddenly dawned on Madelyne that Anthony might be embarrassed about just where he\u0027d sustained his wound. His arms and legs looked fit enough, and that left only his chest and hisâ€¦ \"We\u0027ll not speak of this again,\" Madelyne blurted out. She felt her face warm. When Anthony immediately slowed his pace, Madelyne knew she was right. The injury was in an inappropriate place. Though she never questioned Anthony about it, Madelyne thought it curious that the soldiers trained such long hours every day. She supposed that defending their lord was difficult work, considering the fact that their leader had so many enemies. She didn\u0027t think she was jumping to conclusions either. Duncan wasn\u0027t an easy man to like; he certainly wasn\u0027t given to being tactful or diplomatic. Why, he\u0027d probably collected more enemies than friends in William II\u0027s court. She was, unfortunately, given plenty of time to think about Duncan. She wasn\u0027t at all accustomed to having so much unstructured time on her hands. When she wasn\u0027t outside walking with Anthony, she drove Gerty and Maude to distraction with suggestions for making Duncan\u0027s home more pleasing. Maude wasn\u0027t as guarded as Gerty. She was always eager to set her chores aside and visit with Madelyne. Little Willie, Maude\u0027s four-year-old son, proved to be as talkative as his mother once Madelyne was able to coach his thumb out of his mouth. When the day\u0027s sunlight began to fade, however, Madelyne\u0027s stomach would tighten up and her head would start pounding. It was little wonder, she told herself, when one considered that the evenings spent with the Wexton family were trials of endurance Odysseus would have turned his back on. Madelyne wasn\u0027t allowed to turn her back though. She had all but gotten down on her knees and begged to take her meals in her room, too, but Duncan wouldn\u0027t allow it. Nay, he demanded her attendance at the family meal and then had the gall to remove himself from the disgusting ordeal he forced on her. The baron always ate alone, and made a brief appearance only once the table had been cleared of the clutter the men hadn\u0027t already thrown to the floor. Adela provided the stimulating conversation. While the men hurled bones over their shoulders, Duncan\u0027s sister hurled one obscenity after another at Madelyne. Madelyne didn\u0027t think she could stand the torment much longer. Her smile felt as brittle as dry parchment. On the seventh evening Madelyne\u0027s composure did crack, and with such violent force that those who witnessed it were too astonished to intervene. Duncan had just given her permission to leave the hall. Madelyne stood up, excused herself, and began to walk toward the entrance. Her head was pounding, and she thought only to give Adela a wide path. Madelyne wasn\u0027t up to another round of screaming. Duncan\u0027s little sister was walking toward her. Madelyne warily glanced over at Adela and saw little Willie peeking out from the doorway to the kitchens. The little boy smiled at Madelyne and she immediately stopped to speak to him. The child responded to Madelyne\u0027s smile. He darted out in front of Adela just as the sister swept her hand out in one of the grand gestures she always made when she was about to start in abusing Madelyne again. The back of Adela\u0027s hand struck Willie\u0027s cheek. The little one toppled to the ground. Willie started to wail, Gilard shouted, and Madelyne let out an ear-piercing scream. The sound of rage she made stunned everyone in the hall, even Adela who actually backed up a step, the first real retreat she\u0027d ever made from Madelyne. Gilard started to stand. Duncan grabbed hold of his arm. The youngest brother was about to argue over the restraint, but the look in Duncan\u0027s eyes stopped him. Madelyne rushed over to the little boy, soothed him with a soft word and a tender kiss on the top of his head, and then bade him to go to his mother. Maude, upon hearing her son\u0027s wails, had appeared in the doorway, with Gerty at her side. Madelyne turned to confront Adela then. She might have been able to control her anger if Duncan\u0027s sister had shown any sign of remorse. Adela, however, didn\u0027t look the least bit sorry for her conduct. And when she muttered that the boy was a nuisance, Madelyne let go of her control. Adela called Willie a brat a scant second before Madelyne lashed out and slapped her right where she thought Adela most deserved it, across her mouth. Adela was so stunned by the attack, she lost her balance and stumbled to her knees. Without realizing it, she gave Madelyne added advantage. Before Adela could stand up, Madelyne grabbed hold of her hair and twisted the mass behind her head, making the sister vulnerable and unable to strike back. She forced Adela\u0027s head back. \"You\u0027ve spoken your last word of filth, Adela. Do you understand me?\" Everyone stared at the two women. Edmond was the first to come out of his stupor. \"Unhand her, Madelyne,\" he shouted. Without taking her attention away from Adela, Madelyne shouted back to Edmond. \"Keep out of this, Edmond. You hold me responsible for what happened to your sister, and I\u0027ve decided\u0027tis high time I took a hand to right this mess. Starting now.\" Duncan never said a word. \"I do not hold you responsible,\" Edmond yelled. \"Let go of her. Her mind isâ€”\" \"Her mind needs but a good cleaning, Edmond.\" Madelyne saw that Maude and Gerty were both watching from the doorway. She kept a firm hold on Adela when she turned to speak to them. \"I think we\u0027ll have need for two tubs to rid the filth covering this pitiful creature. See to it, Gerty. Maude find clean clothes for your mistress.\" \"You\u0027re going to have a bath now, milady?\" Gerty asked. \"Adela is going to get a bath,\" Madelyne announced. She turned back to glare at Adela and said, \"And soap in your mouth every time you say an unladylike word to me.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-18.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favoriteâ€”a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
