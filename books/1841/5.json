No one would ever know of her unusual ability, as it was highly unacceptable for a woman to have such schooling. Why, the majority of noblemen could not write their own names. They relied on the holy men to do such meaningless tasks for them. Madelyne certainly didn\u0027t blame her uncle for her lack of training. The dear priest had taken great pleasure in teaching her all the ancient stories. Her favorite was the tale about Odysseus. The mythological warrior had become Madelyne\u0027s companion when she was a young girl and terribly frightened all the time. She\u0027d pretend Odysseus was sitting beside her during the long, dark nights. He helped her ease her fear that Louddon would come and take her back home. Louddon! Even his black name made her stomach tighten up. Aye, he was the true reason Madelyne lacked all the skills necessary for survival. She couldn\u0027t even ride a horse, for God\u0027s sake. He was to blame too. Her brother had taken her riding a few times, when she was six years old, and Madelyne still remembered the outings as clearly as if they\u0027d taken place the day before. Why, she\u0027d made such a fool of herself, or so Louddon screamed, bouncing around the saddle like a clump of hay barely tied in place. And when he realized how frightened she was, he\u0027d tied her to the saddle and slapped the horse into racing through the countryside. Her terror had excited her brother. It wasn\u0027t until Madelyne finally learned to mask her fear that Louddon stopped this sadistic game. For as long as she could remember, Madelyne knew her father and her brother disliked her, and she tried every way she knew how to make them love her just a little. When she turned eight years old, she was sent to Father Berton, her mother\u0027s younger brother, for a short visitation that turned into long, peaceful years. Father Berton was the only living relative on her mother\u0027s side of the family. The priest did his best to raise her, and he constantly told her, until she almost believed him, that it was her father and her brother who were lacking, not her. Oh, her uncle was a good, loving man, whose gentle ways spilled over into Madelyne\u0027s character. He taught her many things, none of them tangible, and he did love her, as much as any real father could love his daughter. He explained to her that Louddon despised all women, but in her heart Madelyne didn\u0027t believe him. Her brother cared about his older sisters. Both Clarissa and Sara had been sent to fine manors to gain their proper education, and each had an impressive dowry to take to their marriages, although only Clarissa had married. Father Berton also told Madelyne that her father wanted nothing to do with her because she looked so much like her mother, a gentle woman he\u0027d married and then turned against almost as soon as the vows had been exchanged. Uncle didn\u0027t know the reason for her father\u0027s change in attitude, but placed the blame on his soul all the same. Madelyne barely remembered the early years, though a warm feeling filled her when she thought about her mother. Louddon hadn\u0027t been there very often to taunt her, and she\u0027d been well protected by her mother\u0027s love. Only Louddon held the answers to her questions. Perhaps he\u0027d explain it all to her one day and then she\u0027d understand. And with understanding would come the healing, wouldn\u0027t it? Lord, I must put these dour thoughts aside, Madelyne decided. She scooted off the boulder and then walked around the campsite, keeping well away from the men. When she turned and went off into the dense forest, no one followed, and she was able to take care of her body\u0027s demands. Madelyne was on her way back when she spotted a small stream. The top was crusted over but Madelyne used a stick to break through the ice. Kneeling down, she washed her hands and her face. The water was frigid enough to make her fingertips wrinkle, but the clear liquid tasted wonderful. Madelyne felt someone standing behind her. She turned, so quickly she almost lost her balance. It was Duncan towering over her. \"Come, Madelyne. \u0027Tis time to rest.\" He didn\u0027t give her time to answer his command but reached down and pulled her to her feet. His big, callused hand enveloped both of hers. His hold was firm, yet his touch gentle, and he didn\u0027t let go of her until they\u0027d reached the opening of his tent, a strange-looking affair consisting of wild animal skins braced into an arch by thick, unyielding branches. The skins would block the rising wind. Another gray fur had been placed on the ground inside the tent, obviously meant to be used as a pallet. The glow from the nearest fire cast dancing shadows on top of the skins, making the tent look warm and inviting. Duncan motioned for Madelyne to get inside. She quickly complied. She couldn\u0027t seem to get settled though. The animal skins had absorbed much of the ground\u0027s dampness and Madelyne felt as if she were draped upon a block of ice. Duncan stood there, his arms folded against his massive chest, watching her try to get comfortable. Madelyne kept her expression contained. She vowed she\u0027d die before offering him one word of complaint. All of a sudden Duncan pulled her to her feet again, very nearly upsetting the tent in his haste. He took her cloak from her shoulders, knelt down on one knee, and spread the garment on top of the animal skins. Madelyne didn\u0027t understand his intent. She had thought the tent was for her, but Duncan settled himself inside, stretching out to his full length, taking up most of the space. Madelyne started to turn away, infuriated over the way he\u0027d claimed her cloak for his own comfort. Why hadn\u0027t he just left her back at Louddon\u0027s fortress if he meant to freeze her to death, instead of dragging her halfway across the world? She didn\u0027t even have time to gasp. Duncan snared her with lightning speed. Madelyne fell on top of him and let out a groan of protest. She\u0027d barely gotten fresh air and new outrage back into her chest before Duncan rolled to his side, taking her with him. He threw his cape over the two of them, trapping her inside his embrace. Her face was up against the base of his neck, the top of her head caught just under his chin. Madelyne immediately tried to get away, horrified by such an intimate position. She used every ounce of energy she possessed, but Duncan\u0027s hold was too strong to be broken. \"I cannot breathe,\" she muttered against his neck. \"Yes you can,\" Duncan answered. She thought she heard amusement in his voice. That infuriated her almost as much as his overbearing attitude. How dare he decide if she could breathe or not? Madelyne was too upset to be frightened. She suddenly realized her hands were still free of restraint. Madelyne slapped his shoulders until her palms were stinging. Duncan had removed his hauberk before entering the tent. Only a cotton shirt covered his massive chest now. The thin material was stretched snugly over his wide shoulders, outlining his thick muscles. Madelyne could feel the strength radiating through the soft fabric. Lord, there wasn\u0027t an ounce of fat to grab hold of and pinch. His skin was as inflexible as his stubborn nature. There was one distinct difference, however. Duncan\u0027s chest felt warm against her cheek, almost hot, and terribly inviting to snuggle up against. He smelled good, too, like leather and male, and Madelyne couldn\u0027t help but react. She was exhausted. Aye, that was the reason his closeness was having such an unsettling effect on her. Why, her heart was racing. His breath heated the side of her neck, comforting her. How could that be? She was so confused; nothing was making sense to her anymore. Madelyne shook her head, determined to shake the sleepy feeling invading her good intentions, and then grabbed hold of his shirt and began to pull on it. Duncan must have become bored with her struggles. She heard him sigh just seconds before he trapped her hands and slid them under his shirt, flattening her palms against his chest. The thick mat of hair covering his warm skin made her fingertips tingle. How could she feel so warm when it was so cold outside? His nearness was an erotic, sensual pull to her senses, flooding her with feelings she hadn\u0027t known she possessed. Aye, it was erotic, which certainly made it sinful, obscene, too, because his pelvis was smashed up against the junction of her legs. She could feel his hardness there, nestled so intimately against her. Her gown proved inadequate protection against his manhood, and her inexperience gave her no protection at all against the strange, bewildering feelings he provoked. Why didn\u0027t she feel sickened by his touch? In truth, Madelyne didn\u0027t feel sick at all, only breathless. A horrid thought entered her mind and she gasped out loud. Wasn\u0027t this the hold a man used when he coupled with a woman? Madelyne fretted over that thought a long moment and then discarded the fear. She remembered the woman had to be flat on her back, and though she wasn\u0027t certain of the exact way of it, she didn\u0027t believe she was in real danger. She\u0027d overheard Marta visiting with the other servants and remembered that the coarse woman had always begun every lusty adventure with the remark that she had been flat on her back. Aye, Madelyne recalled with acute relief, Marta had been most specific. \"Flat on me back I was,\" she always began. Madelyne regretted now that she hadn\u0027t stayed to hear the rest of the woman\u0027s bold tales. Lord, she was lacking in that area of her education too. She got angry then, for a decent lady shouldn\u0027t have had such a worry anyway. It was all Duncan\u0027s fault, of course. Did he hold her so intimately just to mock her? Madelyne was close enough to feel the strength in his powerful thighs trying to flatten her own. He could crush her if he had a mind for it. Madelyne shivered over that picture and immediately quit her struggles. She didn\u0027t want to provoke the barbarian. At least her hands protected her breasts. She was thankful for that much. Her gratitude was short-lived, however, for as soon as she thought to be appreciative, Duncan shifted his weight, and then her br**sts were plastered up against him as well. Her ni**les hardened, shaming her all the more. Duncan suddenly moved again. \"What the devil…\" He roared the unfinished question against Madelyne\u0027s ear. She didn\u0027t know what caused his outburst, only that she was going to be deaf for the rest of her life. When Duncan jumped, muttering an expletive she couldn\u0027t help but catch, Madelyne moved away. She watched Duncan out of the corner of her eye. Her captor had lifted himself up on one elbow and was searching for something underneath him. Madelyne remembered the squire\u0027s dagger she\u0027d hidden in the lining of her cloak just as Duncan lifted the weapon. She couldn\u0027t help but frown. Duncan couldn\u0027t help but grin. Madelyne was so surprised by his spontaneous smile, she almost smiled back. Then she happened to notice his smile didn\u0027t quite reach his eyes. She decided she\u0027d best not smile after all. \"For a timid creature, you\u0027re proving to be resourceful, Madelyne.\" His voice was so mild. Had he just given her praise or was he mocking her? Madelyne couldn\u0027t make up her mind. She decided not to tell him she\u0027d forgotten about the weapon. He\u0027d certainly think her foolish if she admitted that truth. \"You\u0027re the one who captured me,\" she reminded him. \"If I\u0027ve proven to be resourceful, it is only because I am honor bound to escape. \u0027Tis the duty of a captive.\" Duncan frowned. \"Does my honesty offend you, milord?\" Madelyne asked. \"Then perhaps it would be best if I didn\u0027t speak to you at all. I would like to go to sleep now,\" she added. \"And I\u0027m going to try to forget you\u0027re even here.\" To prove she meant what she said, Madelyne closed her eyes. \"Come here, Madelyne.\" The softly issued command sent a tremor of dread down her spine, and a knot settled in the pit of her stomach. He was doing it again, she decided, scaring the breath right out of her. And she was getting sick of it. Madelyne didn\u0027t believe there was much fear left inside her. She opened her eyes to look at him, and when she saw the dagger was now pointed in her direction, she realized she still had quite a store of fear left after all. What a coward I am, Madelyne thought as she slowly moved closer to Duncan. She rested on her side, facing him, just a few inches away. \"There, does that please you?\" she said. She guessed it hadn\u0027t pleased him much at all, when she suddenly found herself flat on her back, with Duncan looming over her. Why, he was so close, she could actually see the silver flecks in his gray eyes. Eyes were supposed to echo the thoughts of the mind, Madelyne had heard, yet she couldn\u0027t tell what Duncan was thinking. That worried her. Duncan watched Madelyne. He was both amused and irritated by the confusion of emotions she unwillingly showed him. He knew she was afraid of him. Yet she didn\u0027t weep or plead with him. And Lord, she was beautiful. There was a sprinkle of freckles on the bridge of her nose. Duncan thought the flaw most appealing. Her mouth was appealing too. He wondered how she\u0027d taste to him and could feel himself becoming aroused just by the thought. \"Are you going to stare at me all night?\" Madelyne asked. \"Perhaps I will,\" Duncan answered. \"If I wish to,\" he added, smiling at the way she tried not to frown at him. \"Then I\u0027ll have to look at you all night,\" Madelyne answered. \"And why is that, Madelyne?\" His voice was soft and husky. \"If you think to take advantage of me while I sleep, you\u0027re mistaken, Baron.\" She looked so indignant. \"And how will I take advantage of you, Madelyne?\" He was smiling at her now, a true grin it was, reflected in the depths of his eyes. Madelyne wished she\u0027d kept silent. Lord, she was putting obscene ideas into his head. \"I\u0027d rather not discuss this issue,\" she stammered out. \"Aye, forget I said anything, if you please.\" \"But I don\u0027t please,\" Duncan answered. \"Do you think I\u0027ll satisfy my lust this night and take you while you rest?\" Duncan lowered his head until he was just a scant breath away from Madelyne\u0027s face. He was pleased to see her blush, even grunted his approval. Madelyne was as still as a doe, trapped by her own worries. \"You wouldn\u0027t touch me,\" she suddenly blurted out. \"Surely you\u0027re too tired to think of such… and we are camped out in the open… nay, you wouldn\u0027t touch me,\" she ended. \"Perhaps.\" And just what did that mean? She saw the mysterious gleam in his eye. Was he gaining true pleasure over her obvious distress. She decided she wasn\u0027t going to be taken advantage of without giving him a good fight. With that thought in mind, she struck him, aiming her fist just below his right eye. Her mark was true, but she thought she received more pain than he did. She was the one who cried out in pain. Duncan didn\u0027t even flinch. Lord, she\u0027d probably broken her hand and all for nothing. \"You are made of stone,\" Madelyne muttered. \"Why did you do that?\" Duncan asked, his tone curious.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-5.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favorite—a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
