{"id":76504,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"How foolish my plan is?\" Duncan repeated, astonished into bellowing by her brash statement. He didn\u0027t understand why he wanted to know what she was talking about, but he did. Hell, she\u0027d just insulted him. He would have killed a man for less. Yet the innocent look on her face, and the sincerity in her voice, indicated she wasn\u0027t even aware of her transgression. Madelyne thought Duncan looked as if he wanted to strangle her. She fought the urge to close her eyes against his intimidating stare. \"If you came for me, then you\u0027ve wasted your time.\" \"You believe your value isn\u0027t worthy enough for my attention?\" Duncan asked. \"Of course. In my brother\u0027s eyes, I have no value. \u0027Tis a fact I\u0027m well aware of,\" she added so matter-of-factly, Duncan knew she believed what she said. \"And you are certain to die tonight. Aye, you\u0027re outnumbered, by at least four to one by my count. There\u0027s a second soldier\u0027s keep in the bailey below us, with over a hundred soldiers sleeping there. They will hear the fight. What think you of that?\" she asked, aware she was now wringing her hands but unable to stop herself. Duncan stood there, staring at her with a puzzled expression on his face. Madelyne prayed the news she\u0027d just shared with him about the second soldier\u0027s keep would force him to see the folly of his plan. Her prayers were in vain. When the baron finally reacted, it wasn\u0027t at all what Madelyne expected. He merely shrugged. The gesture infuriated her. The foolish warrior was clearly bent on dying. \"It was a false prayer to think you\u0027d walk away from this, no matter what the odds, wasn\u0027t it?\" Madelyne asked. \"It was,\" Duncan answered. A warm glint entered his eyes, surprising Madelyne. It was gone before she could even react. Was the baron laughing at her? She didn\u0027t have the courage to ask him. Duncan continued to stare at her another long moment. Then he shook his head, turned, and started to walk toward Louddon\u0027s home. He\u0027d obviously decided he\u0027d wasted enough time on her. There wasn\u0027t the least hint of his intent now. Why, he could have been paying a social call if one judged by the mild look on his face and the slow, unhurried pace. Madelyne knew better. She was suddenly so filled with dread, she thought she was going to be sick. She could feel the bile rising, burning a path all the way up to her throat. Madelyne took deep, gulping breaths while she frantically worked to undo the knots binding her hands. Panic made the task impossible, for Madelyne had just realized there were servants sleeping inside. She doubted Duncan\u0027s soldiers would concern themselves with killing only those armed against them. Louddon certainly wouldn\u0027t have made that distinction. She knew she was going to die soon. That fact couldn\u0027t be undone; she was Louddon\u0027s sister. But if she could save innocent lives before her own death, wouldn\u0027t that act of kindness give her existence some purpose? Dear God, wouldn\u0027t saving one person make her life matter… to someone? Madelyne continued to struggle with the rope while she watched the baron. When he reached the steps and turned back to face his men, his true purpose was obvious. Aye, his expression showed his fury. Duncan slowly raised his sword into the air. And then his voice rang out with such force as to surely penetrate the stone walls surrounding them. His words of purpose were unmistakable. \"No mercy!\" The screams of battle tortured Madelyne. Her mind pictured what she couldn\u0027t see, trapping her within a purgatory of obscene thoughts. She had never actually witnessed a battle before, only heard exaggerated tales of cunning and prowess from boasting victorious soldiers. But none of those stories included the descriptions of the killings, and when the fighting soldiers spilled out into the courtyard, Madelyne\u0027s mental purgatory turned into a living hell, with the blood of the victims transformed into her captor\u0027s fire of revenge. Although the numbers heavily favored Louddon\u0027s men, Madelyne soon realized they were ill prepared to fight Duncan\u0027s well-trained soldiers. She watched as one of her brother\u0027s soldiers raised his sword against the baron and lost his life because of it, witnessed another eager soldier thrust his lance forward and then stare in stupefaction when both lance and arm were severed from his body. An ear-piercing scream of agony followed the assault as the soldier pitched forward to the ground now soaked with his own blood. Madelyne\u0027s stomach lurched over the atrocities; she closed her eyes to block out the horror, but the images continued to haunt her. A boy Madelyne thought might have been Duncan\u0027s squire ran over to stand next to Madelyne. He had bright yellow hair and was of medium height, and so thick with muscles as to appear fat. He pulled a dagger and held it in front of him. He paid her little heed, keeping his gaze directed on Duncan, but Madelyne thought he positioned himself to protect her. She had seen Duncan motion to the boy a short time before. Madelyne desperately tried to focus on the squire\u0027s face. He chewed nervously on his bottom lip. She wasn\u0027t certain if the action was caused by fear or excitement. And then he suddenly bolted, leaving her unattended again. She turned to look at Duncan, noticed that he\u0027d dropped his shield, and then watched the squire race over to retrieve it for his lord. In his haste the squire dropped his own dagger. Madelyne ran over, took hold of the dagger, and then hurried back to the post in case Duncan came for her. She knelt on the ground, her cloak hiding her action, and began to cut the rope binding her hands together. The acrid smell of smoke reached her. She looked up just in time to see a belch of fire explode through the open doorway of the castle. Servants now mingled with fighting men, trying to gain their freedom as they darted toward the gates. The fire chased after them, scorching the air. Simon, first son of the Saxon reeve and an old man now, made his way over to Madelyne. Tears streamed down his leathered face, his thick shoulders stooped forward with despair. \"I thought they\u0027d done you in, milady,\" he whispered as he helped her to her feet. The servant took the dagger from her and quickly cut through the rope. Once she was freed, she cupped the sides of his shoulders. \"Save yourself, Simon. This battle isn\u0027t yours. Hurry now, away from here. Your family needs you.\" \"But you…\" \"Go, before it\u0027s too late,\" Madelyne implored him. Her voice was harsh with fear. Simon was a good godfearing man who had showed her kindness in the past. He was trapped, as were the other servants, by position and heritage, tied by law to Louddon\u0027s land, and that was sentence enough for any man to bear. God couldn\u0027t be so cruel as to demand his life as well. \"Come with me, Lady Madelyne,\" Simon begged. \"I will hide you.\" Madelyne shook her head, denying him. \"You have a better chance without me, Simon. The baron would come after me. Please, don\u0027t argue,\" she hurried to add when she saw he was about to protest again. \"Go.\" She screamed the order and gave it additional emphasis when she pushed against Simon\u0027s shoulders. \"The Lord protect you,\" Simon whispered. He handed her the dagger and turned to make his way to the gates. The old man had gotten only a few feet away from his mistress when he was knocked down to the ground by Duncan\u0027s brother. Gilard, in his haste to attack another of Louddon\u0027s soldiers, accidentally bumped into the servant. Simon made it back to his knees, when Gilard suddenly turned, as if he\u0027d just realized there was another enemy closer at hand. Gilard\u0027s intent was obvious to Madelyne. She screamed a warning and ran over to stand in front of Simon, using her body to shield the servant from Gilard\u0027s blade. \"Stand aside,\" Gilard yelled, his sword raised. \"Nay,\" Madelyne shouted back. \"You\u0027ll have to kill me to get to him.\" Gilard immediately raised his sword higher, suggesting he\u0027d do just that. His face was mottled with fury. She thought Gilard was more than capable of killing her without suffering a moment\u0027s remorse. Duncan saw what was taking place. He immediately started running toward Madelyne. Gilard\u0027s temper was known to be fierce, yet Duncan didn\u0027t worry that his brother would harm Madelyne. Gilard would die before breaking a command. Brother or not, Duncan was Baron of Wexton holdings and Gilard his vassal. Gilard would honor that bond. And Duncan had been most specific. Madelyne belonged to him. No one was to touch her. No one. The other servants, nearly thirty in all, also witnessed what was happening. Those not close enough to freedom hastened over to stand as a group behind Simon for protection. Madelyne met Gilard\u0027s furious stare with a composed expression, a tranquility that belied the destruction going on inside her. Duncan reached his brother\u0027s side just in time to observe Madelyne\u0027s bizarre action. His captive slowly lifted her hand to her hair and then pushed the thick mass of curls away from the side of her neck. In a voice that sounded quite calm, she suggested that Gilard thrust his blade there, and if he pleased, to be quick about it. Gilard looked stunned over Madelyne\u0027s reaction to his bluff. He slowly lowered his sword until its bloodied point was facing the ground. Madelyne\u0027s expression didn\u0027t change. She turned her attention to Duncan. \"Does your hatred for Louddon extend to his servants? Do you kill innocent men and women because they\u0027re bound by law to serve my brother?\" Before Duncan could form an answer, Madelyne turned her back on him. She took hold of Simon\u0027s hand and helped him to his feet. \"I\u0027ve heard that Baron Wexton is an honorable man, Simon. Stand beside me. We\u0027ll face him together, dear friend.\" Turning back to Duncan, she added, \"And we shall see if this lord is honorable or if he be no different from Louddon.\" Madelyne suddenly realized she held the dagger in her other hand. She hid the evidence behind her back until she felt a tear in the lining of her cloak, and then slipped the knife inside, praying the hem was strong enough to hold it. To cover her action, she shouted, \"Every one of these good people has tried to protect me from my brother, and I\u0027ll die before I see you touch them. \u0027Tis your choice.\" Duncan\u0027s voice was filled with contempt when he answered her challenge. \"Unlike your brother, I don\u0027t prey on the weak. Go, old man, leave this place. You may take the others with you.\" The servants were quick to comply. Madelyne watched them run to the gates. His show of compassion surprised her. \"And now, Baron, I\u0027ve one more request. Please kill me now. I know I am a coward for asking, but the wait is becoming unbearable. Do what you must.\" She believed he meant to kill her. Duncan found himself astonished by her comments once again. He decided that Lady Madelyne was the most puzzling woman he\u0027d ever come across. \"I\u0027m not going to kill you, Madelyne,\" he announced before turning away from her. A wave of relief washed over Madelyne. She believed Duncan had given her the truth. He\u0027d looked so surprised when she\u0027d asked him to get the foul deed over with… aye, he was giving her the truth now. Madelyne felt victorious for the first time in her life. She\u0027d saved Duncan\u0027s life and would live to tell about it The battle was finished. The horses had been released from the stables, and chased after the servants through the opened gates seconds before new flames of destruction devoured the brittle wood. Madelyne couldn\u0027t summon up an ounce of outrage over the destruction of her brother\u0027s home. It had never belonged to her. There were no happy memories here. No, there was no feeling outrage. Duncan\u0027s revenge was fitting retribution for her brother\u0027s sins. Justice was being served this dark night by a barbarian dressed in knight\u0027s clothing, a radical to Madelyne\u0027s way of thinking, who dared to ignore Louddon\u0027s powerful friendship with the King of England. What had Louddon done to Baron Wexton to warrant such a retaliation? And what price would Duncan have to pay for his rash action? Would William II, upon hearing of this attack, demand Duncan\u0027s life? The king was apt to please Louddon if he commanded that action. Louddon\u0027s hold on the king was said to be unusual; Madelyne had heard it said that they were special friends. And only last week had she learned what the whispered obscenities really meant. Marta, the stablemaster\u0027s outspoken wife, had taken great delight in revealing the vileness of their relationship late one evening, after she\u0027d swallowed too many swigs of ale. Madelyne hadn\u0027t believed her. She\u0027d blushed and denied it all, telling Marta that Louddon had remained unmarried because the lady he\u0027d given his heart to had died. Marta had scoffed at Madelyne\u0027s innocence. She eventually forced her mistress to admit to the possibility. Until that evening, Madelyne hadn\u0027t realized that some men could act intimately with other men, and the realization that one was her brother and the other reported to be the King of England made it all the more repulsive. Her disgust had turned physical; Madelyne remembered she\u0027d thrown up her dinner, giving Marta quite a laugh. \"Burn the chapel.\" Duncan\u0027s order carried throughout the courtyard, pulling Madelyne\u0027s thoughts back to the present. She immediately picked up her skirts and ran toward the church, hoping she\u0027d have time to gather her meager possessions before the command was carried out. No one seemed to be paying her any attention. Duncan intercepted her just when she reached the side entrance. He slammed his hands up against the wall, blocking her on both sides. Madelyne let out a startled gasp and twisted around to look up at him. \"There isn\u0027t any place you can hide from me, Madelyne.\" His voice was soft. Lord, he sounded almost bored. \"I hide from no one,\" Madelyne answered, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. \"Then you wish to burn with your chapel?\" Duncan asked. \"Or perhaps you think to use the secret passage you told me about.\" \"Neither,\" Madelyne answered. \"All of my possessions are inside the church. I was on my way to fetch them. You said you weren\u0027t going to kill me and I thought to take my things on my own journey.\" When Duncan didn\u0027t respond to her explanation, Madelyne tried again. It was difficult to form a coherent thought, however, with Duncan staring at her so intently. \"I\u0027ll not ask you for a mount, only my clothing from behind the altar.\" \"You\u0027ll not ask?\" He whispered the question. Madelyne didn\u0027t know how to react to it, or the smile he now gave her. \"You truly expect me to believe you\u0027ve been living in the church?\" Madelyne wished she had enough courage to tell him she didn\u0027t care what he believed. Lord, she was a coward. Yet years of painful lessons in controlling her real feelings served her well now. She gave him a tranquil expression, forcing her anger aside. Why, she even managed to shrug.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-3.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favorite—a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
