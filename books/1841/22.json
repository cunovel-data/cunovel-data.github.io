{"id":76695,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"How did you know my uncle\u0027s name?\" Madelyne asked. \"You told me,\" Duncan supplied, smiling over the way her eyes widened. \"When? I\u0027ve an excellent memory and I don\u0027t recall mentioning it.\" \"When you were sick, you told me all about your uncle.\" \"If I spoke to you, I don\u0027t remember. It was rude of you to listen to anything I said.\" \"It wasn\u0027t possible to block out your voice,\" Duncan told her, grinning over the memory. \"You shouted everything you said.\" He exaggerated, just to increase her reaction. When Madelyne wasn\u0027t guarded, her expressions were so innocently refreshing to see. \"Tell me what else I said,\" Madelyne demanded. Her tone sounded with suspicion. \"The list is too long. Suffice it to say that you told me everything.\" \"Everything?\" She looked horrified now. Lord, she was embarrassed. What if she\u0027d told him how much she liked him kissing her? There was a sparkle in Duncan\u0027s eyes. Perhaps he was only teasing her. That didn\u0027t sit well. Madelyne decided to remove that smile. \"Then I gave you all the names of the men I\u0027ve taken to my bed, didn\u0027t I? The game is up, I suppose,\" she ended with a sigh. \"Your game was up the moment we met,\" Duncan told her. His voice was soft. Madelyne felt as though she\u0027d just been caressed. She didn\u0027t know how to react. \"And just what does that mean?\" Duncan smiled. \"You talk too much,\" he told her. \" \u0027Tis yet another flaw you should work on.\" \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" Madelyne returned. \"I\u0027ve said little enough to you all week and you\u0027ve ignored me altogether. How can you suggest I talk too much?\" she asked, daring to poke his shoulder. \"I don\u0027t suggest anything. I state facts.\" Duncan answered. He watched her closely, saw the flash of fire in her blue eyes. Baiting her was easy work. He knew he should stop but he was actually enjoying the way she responded. He could find little harm in it. She was suddenly as feisty as a hellcat. \"It displeases you when I speak what\u0027s on my mind?\" Duncan nodded. She thought he looked every bit the rascal now. A lock of dark hair had fallen forward to rest against his forehead. He was grinning too. Why, it was enough to rattle a saint into cursing. \"Then I\u0027ll just quit talking to you. I vow I\u0027ll never speak to you again. Does that please you?\" He nodded again, though much slower this time. Madelyne took a deep breath, preparing to tell him what she thought about his rudeness, but Duncan silenced her. He lowered his head and brushed his mouth against hers, startling her into temporary submission. With barely any coaching, she opened her mouth to his insistent tongue. Duncan began to make slow love to her with his tongue. Lord, he could feel the fire in her. His hands spread wide against the sides of her face, his fingers tangling in her glorious hair. God how he wanted her. The kiss quickly changed from gentle caress to wild passion. Their tongues mated again and again until Duncan was almost mindless with wanting more. He knew he should stop and was about to pull away, when he felt Madelyne\u0027s hands touch his back. A soft, hesitant caress it was and at first as skittish as a butterfly, but when Duncan growled and delved again into the sweetness of her mouth, the caress gained in pressure. Their mouths were hot, wet, clinging. He felt a shudder pass through her, heard her ragged moan escape when he reluctantly eased himself away from her. Madelyne\u0027s eyes were misty with passion and her lips, red and swollen, beckoned him to taste her again. Duncan knew he shouldn\u0027t have started what he couldn\u0027t finish. His loins throbbed with want and it took a supreme act of will to move away from her. With another groan of frustration Duncan rolled to his side. He wrapped his arm around Madelyne\u0027s waist and pulled her up against him. Madelyne wanted to weep. She couldn\u0027t understand why she kept letting him kiss her. More important, she couldn\u0027t seem to stop herself from kissing him. She was as wanton as a wench. All Duncan had to do was touch her and she went to pieces. Her heart raced, her palms turned hot, and she was filled with a restless yearning for more. She heard Duncan yawn and concluded then that the kiss hadn\u0027t meant much to him at all. The man irritated her just like a rash. Madelyne determined to keep her distance from him even as she contradicted the decision by adjusting herself into the curve of Duncan. When she was almost settled to her satisfaction, Duncan let out a harsh groan. His hands moved to her h*ps and he held her firmly. What a contrary man he was! Didn\u0027t he realize how awkward it was to sleep in her walking gown? She moved again, felt him shudder, and thought then that he might be getting ready to snap at her. Madelyne was too weary to worry about his temper. With a yawn of her own, she fell asleep. It was, without a doubt, Duncan\u0027s most difficult challenge. And if she moved her backside just one more time, he knew he\u0027d fail this test. Duncan had never wanted a woman the way he wanted Madelyne. He closed his eyes and took a deep, ragged breath. Madelyne wiggled against him again, and he began to count to ten, promising himself that when he reached that magic number, he\u0027d be more controlled. The innocent cuddled up against him had absolutely no idea of her jeopardy. Her derriere had driven him to distraction all week long. He pictured the way she walked, saw again the gentle sway of her h*ps as she strolled around his fortress. Did she affect others the way she affected him? Duncan frowned over that question, admitting that she most certainly did. Aye, he\u0027d seen the looks his men had given her when her attention was directed elsewhere. Even faithful Anthony, his most trusted vassal and closest friend, had changed his attitude toward Madelyne. At the beginning of the week Anthony had been silent and taken to frowning, but by week\u0027s end Duncan noticed his vassal was usually the one speaking. And he didn\u0027t trail behind Madelyne any longer either. Nay, he was always right by her side. Just where Duncan wanted to be. He couldn\u0027t fault Anthony for his weakness in falling under Madelyne\u0027s charms. Gilard, however, was of a different cloth altogether. It appeared that the youngest brother was taken with Madelyne. That could present a problem. She started squirming again. Duncan felt as though he\u0027d just been branded. A painful longing claimed his full attention. With a growl of frustration he threw off the covers and got out of bed. Though Madelyne was jarred by the sudden movement, she didn\u0027t wake up. \"Sleeps like an innocent babe,\" Duncan muttered to himself as he walked over to the door. He was going back to his lake and realized with a hefty shake of his head that he\u0027d find true pleasure in this second swim. Duncan wasn\u0027t a patient man. He wanted the issues resolved before he claimed Madelyne for his own though. He resigned himself to the fact that he\u0027d probably be swimming in his lake more often. It wasn\u0027t a challenge that sent him outside now, but a release from the fire burning in his loins. With a mutter of disgust, Duncan closed the door. Chapter Twelve A flower among thorns, an angel among thornsâ€¦ \"And sometimes, Adela, if a babe was born with any noticeable flaw, why, the Spartan fathers would just throw the newborn child out a convenient window or off the top of a nearby cliff to get rid of him. Aye, I can see you\u0027re properly shocked, but my uncle Berton did relate the tales about those fierce warriors of times gone by, and he\u0027d not exaggerate the telling just to please me. It was his duty to recount them with accuracy, you understand.\" \"What were the Spartan ladies like? Did your uncle Berton tell you all about them?\" Adela asked, her voice quite eager. Duncan\u0027s little sister sat on the edge of her bed, trying her best to stay out of the way while Madelyne rearranged the furnishings in her bedroom. Adela had given up trying to convince Madelyne that it wasn\u0027t at all usual for her to work like a serving wench. Her new companion had a stubborn streak and it was useless to argue with her. It had ben over three weeks since Madelyne had forced the confrontation with Adela. Once Adela had told the truth about her ordeal, the pain and guilt had truly lessened. Madelyne had been right about that. Madelyne hadn\u0027t seemed the least shocked by the story. Odd, but that helped Adela as much as the telling. Madelyne sympathized with Adela, yet she didn\u0027t pity her. Now Adela followed Madelyne\u0027s lead, trusting her to know what was best. She accepted that the past couldn\u0027t be undone and tried to put it behind her, just as Madelyne suggested. That was easier said than done, of course, but Madelyne\u0027s friendship, so unrestrictive and so giving, helped Adela take her mind off her problems. Adela had finally started her monthly flux a week ago, and that was one less worry to concern her. Madelyne had opened a new world to Adela. She told the most wonderful stories. Adela was amazed by the wealth of information in Madelyne\u0027s memory and eagerly awaited each day\u0027s new tale. Adela smiled as she watched Madelyne now. Her friend did look a sight. A smudge of dirt had settled on the bridge of her nose, and her hair, though tied with a piece of blue ribbon behind her neck, was gradually gaining freedom from the binding. Madelyne stopped sweeping the dust from the corner and leaned against the handle of her broom. \"I can see I\u0027ve caught your interest,\" she remarked. She paused to brush a stray curl away from her face, making a new mark of dirt on her forehead, and then continued on with her story. \"I do believe the Spartan ladies were most undignified. They\u0027d have to be as horrible as their men, Adela. How would they ever have gotten along if they weren\u0027t?\" Adela answered the question with a giggle. The sound warmed Madelyne\u0027s heart. The transformation in Duncan\u0027s sister was most pleasing. There was a sparkle in her eyes now and she smiled quite often. \"Now that the new priest has arrived, we must be careful not to talk like this in front of him,\" Adela whispered. \"I\u0027ve yet to meet him,\" Madelyne answered. \"Though I\u0027m looking forward to it. It\u0027s high time the Wexton brothers had a man of God looking after their souls.\" \"They used to,\" Adela said. \"But when Father John died, and then the church caught fire well, no one did much of anything about it.\" She shrugged and then said, \"Tell me more about the Spartans, Madelyne.\" \"Well now, the ladies had probably all gone to fat by the time they were twelve or so, though that is just a supposition on my part and not a dictate from my dear uncle. I do know, however, that they took more than one man to their beds.\" Adela gasped and Madelyne nodded, thoroughly satisfied by her friend\u0027s reaction. \"More than one at a time?\" Adela asked. She whispered the question and then blushed with embarrassment. Madelyne nibbled on her lip while she considered if that was possible. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" she finally announced. Her back was to the door, and Adela\u0027s full attention was centered on her friend. Neither noticed Duncan now stood in the open doorway. He was about to announce his presence, when Madelyne spoke again. \"I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s possible to be flat on your back with more than one man at a time,\" she admitted. Adela giggled, Madelyne shrugged, and Duncan, having heard most of Madelyne\u0027s dissertation on the ways of the Spartans, rolled his eyes heavenward. Madelyne had propped the broom against the wall and was now kneeling in front of Adela\u0027s chest. \"We\u0027ll have to empty this if we\u0027re going to move it across the room,\" she said. \"You must finish your story first,\" Adela insisted. \"You do tell the most unusual tales, Madelyne.\" Duncan started to interrupt again and then discarded the notion. In truth, his curiosity was caught. \"In Sparta there wasn\u0027t any such thing as celibacy. Why, it was considered a crime not to wed. Gangs of unmarried women would take to the streets. They\u0027d search for unmarried men and when they found them, they fell upon them.\" \"Fell upon them?\" Adela asked. \"Aye, they\u0027d fall upon the poor man and beat him to a bloody pulp,\" she yelled out. Her head had completely disappeared inside the trunk. \" \u0027Tis the truth I\u0027m telling you,\" Madelyne added. \"What else?\" Adela asked. \"Did you know that the young men were locked in a dark room with the women they\u0027d never seen in the light of day and they were supposed toâ€¦ well, you get my meaning there,\" she ended. Madelyne took a breath, sneezed over the dust inside the chest. \"Some of the women had babies before ever seeing their husbands\u0027 faces.\" She straightened up then, bumped her head on the lid of the chest, and promptly rubbed the ribbon off her head. \"It sounds horrible, but I\u0027ll tell you this. When I think of your brother Duncan, I can imagine his Lady Eleanor might prefer a dark room.\" Madelyne made the statement as a jest. Adela let out a gasp of dismay. The little sister had just noticed Duncan was leaning against the door. Madelyne misunderstood Adela\u0027s reaction and was immediately contrite. \"\u0027Tis common talk I\u0027ve taken up,\" she announced. \"Duncan is your lord, after all, and brother, too, and I\u0027ve no business teasing you about him. I do apologize.\" \"I will accept it.\" It was Duncan giving her forgiveness. Madelyne was so surprised by his booming voice, she bumped her head again when she turned to look up at him. \"How long have you been standing there?\" she asked, blushing with mortification. She stood up and faced him. Duncan didn\u0027t answer her, he just stood there, making her nervous. Madelyne smoothed the wrinkles from her gown, noticed a large stain right above her waist, and immediately folded her hands in front of it. A lock of hair swayed in front of her left eye, but if she moved her hand to push the hair away, he\u0027d see what a mess she\u0027d made of her gown, wouldn\u0027t he? Madelyne had to remind herself that she was only his captive and he her keeper. What difference did it make if she looked messy or not? She blew the hair out of her vision and struggled to give Duncan a serene look. She failed miserably, and Duncan, knowing what was in Madelyne\u0027s mind, smiled over her failure. It was getting more difficult for her to hide her feelings. That fact pleased him almost as much as her disheveled appearance. She thought he smiled over her sorry-looking gown. Duncan reinforced her belief by giving her a thorough inspection. His gaze moved slowly from the top of her head to the dust on her shoes. His smile widened until the attractive dent was back in the side of his cheek. \"Go up to your room, Madelyne, and stay there until I come for you.\" \"May I finish this task first?\" Madelyne asked, trying to sound humble.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-22.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favoriteâ€”a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
