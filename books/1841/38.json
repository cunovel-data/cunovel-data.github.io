I\u0027ve just used up all my strength trying to satisfy your—\" She nudged him to be quiet, for they were close enough for Adela to overhear. \"I needed you to love me,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027ve forgotten all about the priest\u0027s foul touch now. It was the only reason I was a little… bold.\" \"Bold?\" Duncan chuckled. \"Madelyne love, you turned into a—\" She nudged him again, more forcefully, then turned to watch Gerald and Adela. It was Gerald, in fact, who gave Adela explanation about Madelyne\u0027s injuries. \"Oh, Madelyne, you look terrible,\" Adela confessed in a sympathetic voice. \"It\u0027s a sin to lie,\" Madelyne said to Duncan, glaring at him. Duncan demanded Father Laurance\u0027s name not be mentioned during dinner. Everyone complied. Adela went back to ignoring Gerald too. The baron offered Duncan\u0027s sister a compliment when everyone stood to leave the table. Adela made a rude comment back to him. Duncan\u0027s patience was gone. \"I would speak to both of you,\" he demanded. His voice had a hard edge to it. Adela looked frightened, Gerald looked puzzled, and Madelyne looked like she was going to smile. Everyone followed Duncan over to the hearth. Duncan sat in his chair, but when Gerald started to take a chair for his own, Duncan said, \"Nay, Gerald. Stand next to Adela.\" He turned to Adela then and demanded, \"Do you trust me to know what\u0027s best for you?\" Adela slowly nodded. Her eyes were as large as trenchers, Madelyne thought. \"Then let Gerald kiss you. Now.\" \"What?\" Adela sounded appalled. Duncan frowned over her reaction. \"When my wife was attacked by Laurence, she wanted me to wipe the memory away. Adela, you\u0027ve never been kissed or touched by a man who loves you. I suggest you let Gerald kiss you now and then decide if you are repelled or enlightened.\" Madelyne thought it was a wonderful plan. Adela was turning red with embarrassment. \"In front of everyone?\" she asked. Her voice sounded like a squeak. Gerald smiled. He took hold of Adela\u0027s hand. \"I would kiss you in front of the world if you\u0027d allow it,\" he told her. Duncan thought Gerald was going a little overboard, telling Adela she could allow or disallow, yet he kept his thoughts to himself. Besides, his command was finally being carried out. Before Adela could back away, Gerald leaned down and placed a chaste kiss on her lips. Duncan\u0027s sister looked up at Gerald in confusion. And then he kissed her again. His hands never touched her but his mouth held her captive all the same. Madelyne felt foolish watching the pair. She walked over and sat on the arm of Duncan\u0027s chair and tried to stare at the ceiling instead of the two people kissing each other so thoroughly. When Gerald took a step back, Madelyne looked at Adela. Duncan\u0027s sister looked flushed, embarrassed, and truly astonished. \"He doesn\u0027t kiss like Mor—\" The color immediately drained from her face over her near blunder, and she looked at Madelyne for help. \"He\u0027ll have to know, Adela.\" Gerald and Duncan shared a frown. Neither knew what Madelyne was talking about. \"I cannot tell him,\" Adela whispered. \"Would you do this one terrible duty for me? Please, Madelyne. I beg of you.\" \"If you\u0027ll let me tell Duncan as well,\" Madelyne said. Adela looked at her brother. He could see the worry in her gaze. Adela finally nodded. She turned back to Gerald then and said, \"You\u0027ll not ever want to kiss me again when you know the full truth of what happened to me. I\u0027m sorry, Gerald. I should have…\" Adela started to cry. Gerald reached out to take her into his arms but she shook her head, \"I think I do love you Gerald. And I am so sorry.\" With those parting words, Adela rushed out of the room. Madelyne had little liking for the promise she\u0027d made. She knew she was about to cause her husband and Gerald pain. Both men loved Adela. \"Gerald, please sit down and listen to me,\" Madelyne asked. Her voice sounded strained. \"Duncan, promise you won\u0027t be angry with me for keeping this from you. Adela made me promise to share her secret.\" \"I\u0027ll not be angry,\" Duncan announced. Madelyne nodded. She couldn\u0027t bear to look at Gerald while she told the full truth about Adela, so she stared at the floor through the recitation. She stressed the fact that Adela was so disappointed that Gerald hadn\u0027t joined her in court and for that reason was easy prey for Louddon\u0027s deceptions. \"She was really trying to punish you, I think,\" Madelyne told Gerald. \"Though I doubt she realizes that.\" Madelyne dared a look over at Gerald, caught his nod, and then looked at Duncan. She told the rest then, leaving nothing out, and when she told of Morcar\u0027s treachery, she fully expected one or both men to shout in anger. Neither baron said a word. When the telling was finished, Gerald got up and slowly walked out of the hall. \"What will he do?\" Madelyne asked Duncan. She realized she was crying, brushed the tears away from her face, wincing when she knocked her bruises. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Duncan answered. His voice was soft, angry too. \"Are you upset with me for not telling you sooner?\" Duncan shook his head. A sudden thought occurred to him then. \"Morcar is the man you wanted to kill, isn\u0027t he?\" Madelyne frowned. \"You told me you were going to kill a man. Remember? It was Morcar you meant, wasn\u0027t it?\" She nodded. \"I couldn\u0027t let him get away with his treachery, yet I was honor bound to keep Adela\u0027s secret,\" she whispered. \"Duncan, I didn\u0027t know what to do. It is God\u0027s duty to see to sinners. I know that well enough. And I shouldn\u0027t want to kill him. I do, though, God help me, I do.\" Duncan pulled her into his lap. He held her tenderly. He understood his gentle wife\u0027s torment. Each lapsed into silence for several minutes. Madelyne was worrying about Gerald. Would he leave now or would he continue to pursue Adela? Duncan used the time to gain control of his emotions. He didn\u0027t blame Adela for her infatuation with Louddon. His sister was such an innocent, she couldn\u0027t be faulted. But Louddon had deliberately preyed on that innocence. \"I\u0027ll take care of Morcar,\" Duncan said to Madelyne. \"You will not.\" It was Gerald who bellowed the denial. Both Madelyne and Duncan watched Gerald rush over to stand in front of them. His anger was most evident. He was shaking with it. \"Ill kill him, and you as well, Duncan, if you dare deny me this right.\" Madelyne gasped. She looked up at Duncan. His expression didn\u0027t tell her if he was insulted or angry. Duncan stared at Gerald a long moment. Then he slowly nodded. \"Aye, Gerald, it is your right. I\u0027ll stand behind you when you challenge him.\" \"As I\u0027ll stand behind you when you challenge Louddon,\" Gerald answered. The fight went out of Gerald then. He sat down in the chair facing Duncan. \"Madelyne? Would you please tell Adela I\u0027d like to speak to her?\" Madelyne nodded. She hurried to comply but had worried herself sick before she reached Adela\u0027s bedroom. She still didn\u0027t know what Gerald was going to do. Adela had already made up her mind Gerald was going to leave her. \"It\u0027s all for the best,\" she told Madelyne between sobs. \"Kissing is one thing, but that is all I could ever allow. I could never let him come to my bed.\" \"You don\u0027t know if you could or couldn\u0027t,\" Madelyne returned. \"Adela, it won\u0027t be easy but Gerald is a patient man.\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Adela said. \"He\u0027s going to leave me.\" Adela was wrong. Gerald was waiting for her at the bottom of the steps. Without saying a word, he took hold of her arm and led her down the next staircase. Duncan walked over to Madelyne and lifted her up into his arms. \"You look exhausted, wife. \u0027Tis time for bed.\" \"I\u0027d better wait until Adela comes back. She might need me,\" Madelyne protested when Duncan started up the steps. \"I need you now, Madelyne. Gerald will take care of Adela.\" She nodded. \"Madelyne, I have to leave you tomorrow. It will be for a short time only,\" he added before she could interrupt. \"Where are you going?\" she asked. \"Do you have important matters to attend to?\" she asked then, trying her best to sound interested and not disappointed. She couldn\u0027t expect him to spend every minute with her. Duncan was an important man, after ail. \"I do have a matter that calls for attention,\" Duncan answered, deliberately keeping his explanation to a minimum. Madelyne had been through enough torment today. Duncan didn\u0027t want to add another worry, and he knew if he told her about the king\u0027s petition tonight, she wouldn\u0027t get any rest Maude was just coming down the steps when Duncan turned the corner. She said she\u0027d see to the baroness\u0027s bath right away, but Duncan shook his head. He told Maude he\u0027d take care of the task. Maude made a curtsy. \"Maude, your son has done a courageous thing today.\" The woman beamed. She\u0027d already heard all about her son\u0027s brave act. The lad had made his parents proud. Why, he saved the baroness\u0027s life. \"I\u0027ll have to think of a suitable reward for such bravery,\" Duncan said. Maude looked too overwhelmed to speak. She made another curtsy, then stammered out her gratitude. \"I do thank you, milord. My Willie took a fancy to the baroness. He\u0027s a bit of a nuisance, running after her all the time, but she don\u0027t seem to mind it and always has a kind word for my boy.\" \"He\u0027s an intelligent lad,\" Duncan said in praise. His flattery, an unusual event to be sure, added to the fact that he was actually speaking to her, made Maude feel giddy. She thanked her lord again, picked up her skirts, and went flying down the steps. Gerty would be wanting to hear this tale to be sure. Maude was bent on being the first to tell Madelyne brushed her hand against her husband\u0027s cheek. \"You\u0027re a good man, Duncan,\" she whispered to him. \" \u0027Tis yet another reason I love you so much.\" Duncan shrugged, forcing Madelyne to grab hold of his shoulders to keep her balance. \"I do only my duty,\" he commented. Madelyne smiled. She thought her husband was as awkward with praise as Maude appeared to be. \"I\u0027ve been denied my bath,\" she said, teasing him. \"Perhaps I\u0027ll swim in your lake. What say you to that?\" she added. \"I say it\u0027s a good plan, wife. I will swim with you.\" \"I was only teasing you,\" Madelyne rushed out. \"I don\u0027t want to swim in your lake.\" She shivered. \"When I was little, I jumped into the pond. It wasn\u0027t deep, and I did know how to swim, you understand. But my toes squished in the mud and my gown weighed ten stone, at least, before I could drag myself out. Why, I needed another bath then and there. Mud was even caked in my hair.\" Duncan laughed. \"First of all, my lake has a rock bottom in most places,\" he said. \"And you aren\u0027t supposed to swim with your clothes on, Madelyne. I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t drown.\" She didn\u0027t look too convinced of the merits of his lake. \"The water is clear. You can almost see to the bottom,\" Duncan told her. They reached their bedroom. Madelyne was undressed and waiting for Duncan in their bed before her husband had removed his tunic. \"You don\u0027t want to swim with me?\" he asked her with a grin. \"No,\" Madelyne said. \"There are soldiers outside. Good Lord, Gerald and Adela are outside too. It wouldn\u0027t be decent to parade in front of them without my clothes on. Whatever could you be thinking of, Duncan, to suggest such—\" \"Madelyne, no one goes to the lake at night. Besides, the moon isn\u0027t bright enough to—\" She interrupted him with a startled gasp. \"Duncan, what are you doing?\" It was obvious even to her, Duncan was standing next to the bed, holding her cloak up. \"Wrap yourself in this. I\u0027ll carry you to the lake,\" he suggested. Madelyne nibbled on her lip in indecision. She really did want to swim. It was hot and sticky tonight. Yet the thought of being seen by anyone was a worry to be considered. Duncan patiently waited for Madelyne to make her choice. He thought she looked terribly appealing right now. Only a thin blanket covered her, and the tips of her br**sts were nicely revealed. \"You said I looked exhausted,\" Madelyne stalled. \"Perhaps…\" \"I lied.\" \"\u0027Tis a sin to lie to me,\" Madelyne commented. She pulled the blanket up, holding it like a shield against him. \"My soap is in your chest,\" she told him. Madelyne thought to send him on an errand so she could wrap the cloak around her in privacy. She still wasn\u0027t used to parading around him naked. Duncan grinned. He walked over to the chest to get the soap. Madelyne tried to grab her cloak before he turned, but she wasn\u0027t quick enough. Her husband returned to the side of the bed. Her cloak was draped over his arm. The packet of soap was in one hand and a small circular mirror in the other. He handed the mirror to Madelyne. \"You\u0027ve a black eye to match the one you gave Edmond,\" he remarked. \"I never gave Edmond a black eye,\" Madelyne protested. \"You\u0027re teasing me.\" She turned the mirror over and looked at her face. Madelyne screamed. Duncan laughed. \"I do look like a Cyclops,\" she shouted. She dropped the mirror and began to pull her hair forward over the injured side of her face. \"How can you stand to kiss me?\" she asked. \"I\u0027ve a black circle around my eye and…\" She sounded like she was wailing. Duncan\u0027s smile faded when he leaned forward. With the palm of his hand he forced her chin up to make her look at him. His expression was most serious now. \"Because I love you, Madelyne. You\u0027re everything I\u0027ve ever wanted, and much, much more. Do you think a bruise or two could sway my heart? Do you believe my love could be so shallow?\" Madelyne shook her head. She slowly edged the blanket away and then stood up next to her husband. She wasn\u0027t shy with him anymore. Duncan loved her. That was all that mattered. \"I would like to go to your lake now, Duncan. But we better hurry, before I begin to beg you to make love to me.\" Duncan cupped her chin with his hands and kissed her. \"Oh, I am going to love you, Madelyne.\" She was warmed by the promise and the dark look in his eyes. She heard herself sigh, felt a warm knot in her stomach begin to spread inside of her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-38.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favorite—a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
