{"id":76694,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Why then did he allow the main hall to be so ill attended? That didn\u0027t make sense to her, now that she\u0027d seen his own quarters. She decided to question him about it just as soon as she caught him in a good mood. Madelyne did smile then, for she realized she might very well be an old woman before Duncan achieved such a remarkable change in disposition. Duncan didn\u0027t seem to be in any particular hurry to release her. He walked over to the hearth, leaned his shoulders against the edge of the thick mantel, and began to rub back and forth, obviously appeasing a sudden itch. Madelyne held on to him for dear life. Lord, she wished he were wearing a shirt. It wasn\u0027t decent, she told herself, because she liked touching his skin too much. Duncan was like a bronze god. His skin felt warm, and with her palms resting on his shoulders, she could feel the rippled muscles play beneath her fingertips. She wished she could understand her reaction to him. Why, her heart was pacing a wild beat again. Madelyne dared a quick look up and found Duncan was watching her intently. He looked so handsome. She wanted him to be ugly. \"Are you going to hold me the rest of the night?\" she asked, sounding ridiculously disgruntled. Duncan shrugged, almost unsettling Madelyne. She grabbed hold of him again, and when he smiled at her, she realized he might have jarred her just to get her to cling to him. \"Answer my question first, then I\u0027ll release you,\" Duncan commanded. \"I\u0027ll answer your question,\" she told him. \"Did you tell me you thought to kill a man?\" \"I did.\" She stared at his chin when she answered him. Madelyne waited a long minute for Duncan to comment on her admission. She thought he\u0027d probably lecture her on her weakness for the task of killing anyone. She was, however, totally unprepared for his laughter. It started as a low rumble in his chest, yet quickly gained in sound, until he was all but choking with true joy. He\u0027d heard her correctly after all. Madelyne did tell him she was going to kill. That statement was at first so astonishing, he believed she was jesting. Yet the serious look on her face indicated she really meant what she said. His reaction didn\u0027t please her much. God help him, he couldn\u0027t quit laughing. He let Madelyne slip out of his grasp but kept his hands settled on her shoulders so she couldn\u0027t bolt. \"And who is the unfortunate man you plan to kill?\" he finally managed to ask. \"One of us Wextons perchance?\" Madelyne pulled away from him. \"Of course it isn\u0027t a Wexton, though to give you the full truth, if I had an evil soul, you\u0027d be the first on my list of those I\u0027d do in, milord.\" \"Ah,\" Duncan returned, smiling still. \"If it isn\u0027t one of us, my sweet, gentle lady, then who do you wish to\u0027do in\u0027?\" he asked, using her ridiculous expression for killing. \"Aye,\u0027tis the truth, Duncan. I am a sweet, gentle maiden and it\u0027s high time you understood that,\" Madelyne answered. Her voice didn\u0027t sound particularly sweet now. Madelyne walked over to the bed and sat down on the side. She took a long time smoothing her skirt and then folded her hands in her lap. She was truly appalled that she could speak so easily of taking another\u0027s life. But then, the man she had in mind was certainly in need of killing, wasn\u0027t he? \"You\u0027ll not get his name from me, Duncan. \" \u0027Tis my own affair, not yours.\" Duncan wasn\u0027t in agreement but decided to wait before he forced the truth. \"And when you kill this man, Madelyne, will you lose your food from your stomach again?\" She didn\u0027t answer him. Duncan thought she might be realizing just how foolish her plan was. \"And will you cry as well?\" he asked her, repeating her reaction after killing the soldier who attacked Gilard. \"I\u0027ll remember not to eat anything before I kill him, Duncan, so that I won\u0027t become ill, and if I cry after I\u0027ve done it, then I\u0027ll just find a private place so that no one will see me. Is that explanation enough for you?\" Madelyne took a deep breath, trying desperately to keep her expression contained. Lord, she already felt like a sinner. \"Death is not to be taken lightly,\" she said then. \"But justice shouldn\u0027t be cheated either.\" Duncan started laughing again. That infuriated her. \"I\u0027d like to sleep now, so please leave.\" \"Do you think to tell me to leave my own quarters?\" Duncan asked. He wasn\u0027t laughing now, and Madelyne didn\u0027t have the nerve to look at him. \"I was,\" she admitted. \"If I\u0027m being disrespectful, I\u0027m sorry for it. But you know I don\u0027t lie. It\u0027s kind of you to give up your bed for this one night. I really do appreciate it. And I\u0027ll return to the tower tomorrow, after Adela\u0027s room has been scrubbed.\" She was out of breath after she finished her explanation. \"Your honesty is refreshing.\" \"It gets me into mischief.\" Madelyne sighed. She continued to look down at her hands, wishing Duncan would hurry up and leave. Then she heard a soft thud. That noise did draw her attention, and when she glanced up, she was just in time to watch Duncan remove his second boot and drop it to the floor. \"\u0027Tis indecent to stand before me without your shirt on,\" Madelyne stated. \"And now you\u0027re taking off the rest of your garments before you leave? Do you parade around Lady Eleanor like this?\" Madelyne could feel herself blushing. She was determined to ignore Duncan. If he wanted to strut around half naked, then she\u0027d just close her eyes. And he\u0027d get no parting words from her either. She was a bit slow to catch on to Duncan\u0027s intentions. Madelyne continued to watch him out of the corner of her eye. Duncan knelt down in front of the fire, added another fat log. She almost thanked him for that courtesy, until she remembered she was bent on ignoring him. Lord, he did make her lose her train of thought, didn\u0027t he? Duncan stood up and walked over to the door. Before Madelyne knew what he was about to do, he pushed the thick slat of wood through the metal loops. Her eyes widened in astonishment. She was locked inside the bedroom, but the true problem, as she viewed it, was that Duncan was on the wrong side of the door. And not even a sweet, gentle lady of breeding could misinterpret the meaning of that action. Madelyne let out a gasp of outrage, bounded off the bed, and ran over to the door. Her intention was single-minded. She was going to get out of this room and away from Duncan. He watched her struggle with the latch for a moment. When he was satisfied she\u0027d never be able to figure out the unusual lock beneath the bar, he walked over to the bed. He decided to leave his pants on out of deference to Madelyne\u0027s feelings. She looked close to the brink of losing her control again. \"Come to bed, Madelyne,\" Duncan demanded as he stretched out on top of the covers. \"I\u0027ll not sleep next to you,\" Madelyne stammered. \"We\u0027ve slept together…\" \"Only once, in that tent, Duncan, and that was for necessity\u0027s sake. We shared each other\u0027s heat.\" \"Nay, Madelyne, I\u0027ve slept beside you every night since,\" Duncan announced. Madelyne turned to glare at Duncan. \"You have not!\" \"Aye, I have.\" He was smiling at her. \"How can you lie so easily?\" Madelyne demanded. She didn\u0027t give him time to answer but turned around again and began to work on the latch. A sliver of wood under the tender skin on her thumb was her reward for her efforts. She yelped in anger. \"And now I\u0027ve most of this damn wood under my skin, thanks to you,\" she muttered as she bent her head to look at the damage. Duncan sighed. Madelyne heard the exaggerated sound all the way across the room, but she didn\u0027t hear him move, and when he suddenly grabbed hold of her hand, she jumped back, clipping the top of her head against the bottom of his chin. \"You move just like a wolf,\" she announced as she allowed him to drag her toward the light of the fire. \" \u0027Tis no compliment I\u0027m giving you, Duncan, so you can quit smiling.\" Duncan ignored her mutterings. He reached up on the mantel and took hold of a sharp, almost needle-pointed dagger. Madelyne closed her eyes until she felt the first prick. She had to open her eyes then, for if she didn\u0027t watch him, he\u0027d probably cut her thumb clean off. Madelyne leaned down until she inadvertently blocked Duncan\u0027s view of her thumb. He pulled her hand upward to get it in a better light. He bent his head to finish his task. Madelyne\u0027s forehead touched Duncan\u0027s. She didn\u0027t move away, and neither did he. He smelled nice. She smelled like roses again. The splinter was removed. Madelyne didn\u0027t say a word to him, but she was looking up at him with such a trusting expression on her face. Duncan frowned in frustration. When she looked at him like that, all he could think about was taking her into his arms and kissing her. Hell, he admitted with disgust, all she had to do was look at him and he wanted to bed her. Duncan threw the dagger back on the mantel and then went back to bed. He hadn\u0027t let go of Madelyne\u0027s hand and now dragged her behind him. \"Can\u0027t even get a splinter out and you think to kill a man,\" he muttered. \"I am not sleeping with you,\" Madelyne stated most emphatically. She stood beside the bed, determined to win. \"You\u0027re the most arrogant, the most stubborn man. My patience is running as thin as water. I\u0027ll not put up with much more.\" Madelyne realized her error was in getting too close to Duncan when she shouted her threat. He reached up and literally lifted her on top of him. She landed with a thud. Duncan shrugged her to his side, his hand still locked on her wrist. He closed his eyes, obviously trying to dismiss her. Madelyne faced him. \"You hate me too much to sleep next to me. You lied, didn\u0027t you, Duncan? We haven\u0027t been sleeping together. I\u0027d remember it.\" \"You can sleep through a battle,\" Duncan remarked. His eyes were still closed but he was smiling. \"And I don\u0027t hate you, Madelyne.\" \"You most certainly do hate me,\" Madelyne retorted. \"Don\u0027t you dare change your mind now.\" She waited a long while for Duncan to answer her. When he didn\u0027t say a word, she started in again. \"It was a sorry deed that brought us together. I saved your life. And how am I repaid? Why, you drag me to this godforsaken place, constantly abusing my good nature, I might add. I imagine you\u0027ve conveniently forgotten all about my saving Gilard\u0027s life too.\" Lord, she wished he\u0027d open his eyes so she could see his reaction. \"Now I\u0027ve taken on caring for Adela. I\u0027m wondering, though, if you hadn\u0027t planned that all along.\" Madelyne frowned over that thought and then continued. \"You should admit by now that I\u0027m the innocent in this scheme of yours. I\u0027m the one who is being wronged. Why, when I think of all I\u0027ve been through—\" Duncan\u0027s snore stopped her cold. Madelyne was suddenly so furious, she wished she had the courage to scream right into his ear. \"I\u0027m the one who should hate you,\" she muttered to herself. She adjusted her gown and settled herself on her back. \"If I didn\u0027t have satisfactory plans of my own, I\u0027d be angry over what you\u0027ve done to ruin my good name, Duncan. I can\u0027t ever make a suitable marriage now. That\u0027s a certainty, but I\u0027ll admit Louddon will be the loser, not me. He was going to sell me to the highest bidder. At least that\u0027s what he told me he was going to do. Now he\u0027ll only kill me if he gets near enough,\" she muttered. \"And all because of you,\" she added with gusto. She was exhausted when she finished her complaints. \"How am I ever going to get you to promise me anything? And I\u0027ve already given my word to poor Adela,\" she added with a weary yawn. Duncan moved then. Madelyne was caught unprepared. She only had time to open her eyes before Duncan was leaning over her. His face was close to hers, his breath warm and sweet against her cheeks. One of his heavy thighs trapped her. Good God, she was flat on her back. \"I\u0027ll find a way to tell your Lady Eleanor if you take advantage of me,\" Madelyne blurted out. Duncan rolled his eyes heavenward. \"Madelyne, your mind is consumed with my taking…\" She slapped her hand over his mouth and held it there. \"Don\u0027t dare say it,\" she returned. \"And why else would you be draped over me like a blanket if you didn\u0027t want to…\" Madelyne matched his sigh with one of her own. \"You try to make me daft,\" she accused him. \"You already are,\" Duncan announced. \"Get off me. You weigh more than the doors to your home.\" Duncan shifted his weight until his bulk was cushioned by his elbows. His pelvis rested against Madelyne\u0027s. He could feel the heat in her. \"What promise do you want from me?\" Madelyne looked confused by the question. \"Adela,\" Duncan reminded her. \"Oh,\" Madelyne said, sounding breathless. \"I had thought to wait until tomorrow to speak to you about Adela. I didn\u0027t realize you\u0027d make me sleep with you though. And I\u0027d hoped to catch you in a better mood…\" \"Madelyne.\" The last of her name was drawn out in a long, controlled groan and she knew from the way he clenched his jaw that his patience was gone. \"I wish you to give me your word Adela may live here with you for as long as she wants, and that you\u0027ll not force a marriage on her, no matter what the circumstances. There, is that specific enough for you?\" Duncan frowned. \"I\u0027ll speak to Adela tomorrow,\" he stated. \"Your sister is too frightened to speak freely to you, but if I may tell her you\u0027ve given your word, then I believe you\u0027ll see a remarkable change in her. She\u0027s so worried, Duncan, and if we can ease her burden, she\u0027ll feel much better.\" He felt like smiling. Madelyne had taken on the role of mother to Adela, just as he suspected she would. He was enormously pleased his plan had worked. \"Very well. Tell Adela I\u0027ve given my word. I\u0027ll have to speak to Gerald,\" he added, almost as an afterthought. \"Gerald will just have to find someone else to marry. Adela believes the contract isn\u0027t binding now, anyway. Besides, Gerald will want an unblemished woman, and that makes me dislike him immensely.\" \"You never even met the man,\" Duncan said with exasperation. \"How can you judge him so easily?\" Madelyne frowned. Duncan was right though it was almost painful to give him that admission. \"Does Gerald know all of what happened to Adela?\" \"By now all of England knows. Louddon would have made certain.\" \"My brother is an evil man.\" \"Does your uncle Berton feel the same way about Louddon?\" Duncan asked.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-21.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favorite—a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead.
