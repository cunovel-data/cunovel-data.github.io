{"id":76717,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"The old fears were trying to get the better of her. She\u0027d soon be weeping and feeling pity for herself if she didn\u0027t guard against it. Madelyne decided she needed rest. Aye, it was only because she was so exhausted that she tended to worry now. \"I do have value,\" she blurted out. \"Why has it taken me so long to know it?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter how long it took,\" her uncle said. \"What\u0027s important is that you\u0027ve finally realized it.\"\\n\\n The rumble of thunder drew her uncle\u0027s attention. \"Sounds as though we\u0027ll be having a good rain in a few minutes,\" he remarked as he stood and started for the window.\\n\\n \"Thunder\u0027s close enough to pull the roof apart,\" Madelyne remarked, her voice a sleepy whisper.\\n\\n Father Berton was about to agree with his niece\u0027s comment when he reached the window and looked outside. The sight he beheld so startled him, he had to brace his hands against the window\u0027s ledge, else lose his balance and surely collapse to his knees.\\n\\n The thunder was silent now. But Father could see the lightning. It wasn\u0027t in the sky though. Nay, it was on the ground… for as far as his eyes could see.\\n\\n The sun forced the pretense, deflecting the shards of silver bolts as they bounced from chest plate to chest plate.\\n\\n A legion it be, united behind one warrior, all armored, all quiet, all waiting.\\n\\n Father squinted against the magnificent sight. He nodded once to the soldier\u0027s leader and then turned to walk back to his chair.\\n\\n A wide smile transformed the old priest\u0027s face. When he was again seated beside Madelyne, he forced his smile aside, dared to affect a disgruntled sound to his voice, and said, \"I believe there\u0027s someone here to see you, Madelyne. Best see who it be, child. I\u0027m too weary to get up again.\"\\n\\n Madelyne frowned over his request. She hadn\u0027t heard anyone knock on their door. As a measure to placate him, she stood up to do his bidding. She remarked over her shoulder that she supposed it could be Marta paying a call to give them fresh eggs and old gossip.\\n\\n The priest gained such a chuckle over her comment, he actually slapped his knee.\\n\\n She thought it was a strange reaction from a man who\u0027d just protested weariness.\\n\\n And then she opened the door.\\n\\n It took a minute or two for Madelyne to comprehend what she was seeing. She was so astonished, she couldn\u0027t move. She simply stood there, in the center of the doorway, with her hands clenched at her sides, staring up at Duncan.\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t forgotten her after all. The realization settled in Madelyne\u0027s mind once the numbness had worn through.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t alone either. Nay, over a hundred soldiers were lined up behind their lord. All were still on horseback, all were wearing their full glorious battle armor, and every one of them was looking at her.\\n\\n A silent signal brushed through the legion. As one, they suddenly raised their swords in salutation. It was the most magnificent show of loyalty Madelyne had ever witnessed.\\n\\n She was overwhelmed. Madelyne had never felt so cherished, so loved, and so very, very worthy.\\n\\n And then she understood the reason Duncan had called up so many of his soldiers to make this journey. He was showing her how important she was to him. Aye, he was proving her value.\\n\\n Duncan didn\u0027t move. He didn\u0027t say a word for a long time. He was content to stay on Silenus\u0027s back and look upon his beautiful wife. Duncan could feel his worry, his uncertainty, ebb from his heart. God\u0027s truth, he thought he was the most content man in all the world.\\n\\n When he noticed the tears streaming down Madelyne\u0027s face, he finally gave her the words he thought she needed to hear. \"I\u0027ve come for you, Madelyne.\"\\n\\n Was it coincidence that Duncan now repeated the very first words he\u0027d ever spoken to her? Madelyne didn\u0027t think so. The look in Duncan\u0027s eyes made her believe he did remember.\\n\\n Madelyne straightened away from the door, tossed her hair over her shoulder, and then very deliberately put her hands on her hips. \" \u0027Tis high time, Baron Wexton. I have waited the longest while for you.\"\\n\\n She thought her arrogant remarks pleased Duncan, but she couldn\u0027t be certain. He moved too quickly for her to see his face. One minute he was seated atop Silenus, and the next he was pulling her into his arms.\\n\\n When he leaned down to kiss her, Madelyne threw her arms around his neck. She clung to him as his mouth feverishly settled on hers with almost frantic possessiveness. His tongue thrusted inside to reconquer what belonged to him.\\n\\n Madelyne felt as though she was being swept away by a tide of arousal rushing through her. She met Duncan\u0027s demand by giving him all she knew how to give. Aye, she was just as savage in her quest to devour him. She was just as hungry for his touch, just as frantic.\\n\\n The noise finally penetrated Duncan\u0027s mind. Reason was slow to return, however. He pulled his mouth away only to immediately return to her bruised lips a second time.\\n\\n Madelyne also caught the sound. When Duncan finally lifted his head away from hers, she realized the soldiers were cheering. Good Lord, she\u0027d quite forgotten they were there.\\n\\n She knew she blushed and told herself she didn\u0027t care. Duncan didn\u0027t seem the least concerned, but he was so covered with dust and grime, and a full week\u0027s worth of whiskers, it was difficult to see any reaction.\\n\\n He kissed her again, a quick, hard kiss it was, that told her he wasn\u0027t the least concerned about their audience. Madelyne\u0027s arms circled his waist. She leaned the side of her face against his chest and squeezed with all her might.\\n\\n He sighed, pleased with her enthusiasm.\\n\\n Madelyne remembered her duty, when she heard a discreet cough sound behind her. She should introduce Duncan to her uncle. The problem, of course, was that she couldn\u0027t get the words past her throat. And when Duncan leaned down and whispered, \"I love you Madelyne,\" she became too preoccupied with weeping to speak at all.\\n\\n Duncan motioned for his men to dismount and turned to look over Madelyne\u0027s head to the old man waiting a short distance behind her. He pulled Madelyne into his side, unwilling to let her move away from him for even a short time, and then said, \"I am Baron Wexton.\"\\n\\n \"I would certainly hope so,\" Father Berton answered. The priest smiled over his own jest and then started to bow. He was stayed from the formal show of respect by the baron\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"\u0027Tis I who should kneel before you,\" he told the priest. \"I\u0027m honored to meet you at last, Father.\"\\n\\n The priest was humbled by the baron\u0027s speech. \"She is your greatest treasure, is she not, Baron?\" he asked. He was looking at Madelyne now.\\n\\n \"Aye, she is,\" Duncan admitted. \"I will be forever in your debt,\" he added. \"You have protected her for me all these years.\"\\n\\n \"She isn\u0027t yours yet,\" Father Berton announced. He was pleased to see the surprise that remark caused. \"Aye, I\u0027ve still to give her to you. \u0027Tis a marriage I\u0027m speaking of, a true marriage, Baron, and the sooner done the better for this old man\u0027s peace of mind.\"\\n\\n \"Then you will wed us in the morning,\" Duncan dictated.\\n\\n Father Berton had witnessed the passionate kiss between the baron and his niece. He wasn\u0027t at all sure tomorrow would be fast enough. \"You\u0027ll not be sleeping next to Madelyne tonight then,\" he warned. \"I\u0027ll continue to guard her well, Baron Wexton.\"\\n\\n Duncan and Father Berton exchanged a long, hard stare. Then Duncan smiled. For the first time in a very long while, he found he couldn\u0027t intimidate someone. Nay, the priest wasn\u0027t going to back down.\\n\\n He nodded. \"Tonight.\"\\n\\n Madelyne witnessed the exchange. She knew full well what the two men were talking about. She thought she might have looked as red as a sunburn. It was, after all, an embarrassment for her uncle Berton to know she\u0027d slept with the baron.\\n\\n \"I would also like to wed Duncan tonight, but I do not—\" Madelyne paused in her explanation when she saw Anthony walk over to stand by her side. \"Father, this is the vassal I told you about,\" she said, smiling now.\\n\\n \"You are the one who placed yourself between my niece and Louddon when he tried to strike her again?\" the priest asked, moving forward to grasp Anthony\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"I was,\" Anthony admitted.\\n\\n \"Again?\" Duncan shouted. \"She wasn\u0027t in the king\u0027s protection?\"\\n\\n \"It was nothing,\" Madelyne protested.\\n\\n \"He would have killed her,\" the priest interjected.\\n\\n \"Aye, he wanted to harm her,\" Anthony said.\\n\\n Madelyne could feel the tension in Duncan\u0027s grip around her waist.\\n\\n \"It was nothing,\" Madelyne protested again. \"A mere slap…\"\\n\\n \"She carries the bruises still,\" Father Berton announced with a vigorous nod.\\n\\n Madelyne gave her uncle a good frown. Couldn\u0027t he tell his comments were upsetting Duncan?\\n\\n When Duncan tilted her face up so that he could see the marks, Madelyne shook her head again. \"He\u0027ll never touch me again, Duncan. That is all that matters. Your loyal vassal did protect me,\" she added before turning back to look at her uncle. \"Uncle, why do you incite Duncan\u0027s anger?\"\\n\\n \"There are marks on her shoulders and back, Baron,\" Father Berton said, ignoring Madelyne\u0027s question.\\n\\n \"Uncle!\"\\n\\n \"You did not say a word to me,\" Anthony said to Madelyne. \"I would have—\"\\n\\n \"Enough. Father, I know you well. What game do you play now?\" Madelyne demanded.\\n\\n \"You were about to tell Baron Wexton you\u0027d like to marry him tonight, child, but you didn\u0027t finish your comments, now, did you? The truth of the matter, Baron,\" the priest said, turning to Duncan, \"is that my niece will try to delay this marriage. Won\u0027t you, Madelyne? You see, child,\" he added, giving Madelyne a tender smile, \"I know your mind better than you think I do.\"\\n\\n \"Does he speak the truth?\" Duncan asked, frowning. \"You have not changed your feelings, have you?\" Before Madelyne could answer, he said, \"It will not matter. You belong to me, Madelyne. \u0027Tis a fact you cannot turn your back on.\"\\n\\n Madelyne was so astonished that Duncan would feel such insecurity. She realized then that his feelings were just as vulnerable as her own. It seemed that he needed to hear the words of her love as often as she did. \"I love you, Duncan,\" she said, loud enough for both Anthony and Father Berton to hear.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware of that,\" Duncan returned, sounding arrogant again. His grip lessened, though, and he did relax against her.\\n\\n \"There is much to be seen to,\" Anthony commented. \"I have need to speak to you in private, Baron.\" The vassal turned and started to walk away.\\n\\n \"And you must surely be in need of a meal,\" the priest added. He turned to walk back inside his cottage. \"I shall begin preparations immediately.\"\\n\\n \"A bath is first,\" Duncan said, giving Madelyne a good squeeze before releasing her. He was following her uncle, when Madelyne\u0027s words stopped him cold. Anthony and Father Berton also paused.\\n\\n \"We cannot marry just yet, Duncan.\"\\n\\n She could tell, from the look on all three faces, that none of them cared for her announcement.\\n\\n Madelyne clasped her hands together. Her words were hurried, for she wanted to make Duncan see reason before he bellowed at her. \"If only we could wait until Gerald is wed to Adela, then Louddon cannot use the argument…\"\\n\\n \"I knew it,\" Anthony muttered. \"You still try to protect the world. Baron, that is only one of the announcements I\u0027ve need to explain to you.\"\\n\\n \"She always would protect those she believed needed it,\" the priest said.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" Madelyne said, rushing up to face Duncan. \"If we marry now, you\u0027ll be going against your king. He\u0027ll give Adela to Louddon. That\u0027s what the missive suggested, Duncan.\"\\n\\n Madelyne would have continued her argument but for look in Duncan\u0027s eyes. She couldn\u0027t stop wringing her hands, but she was able to close her mouth.\\n\\n Duncan stared at Madelyne a long moment. She couldn\u0027t tell if he was pleased or angered with her now. \"I have but one question to put to you, Madelyne. Do you have faith in me?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t need time to think about it. Her answer was quick and forceful.\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n Her answer pleased him. Duncan embraced her, placed a chaste kiss on her forehead, and then turned away again. \"We marry tonight.\"\\n\\n He stopped then, but didn\u0027t turn around. Madelyne knew what he waited for. Aye, he sought her agreement.\\n\\n \"Yes, Duncan, we\u0027ll marry tonight.\"\\n\\n It was, of course, the correct answer. Madelyne knew that well enough when her uncle started chuckling, Anthony started whistling, and Duncan turned to give her a firm nod.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t smiling. That didn\u0027t bother her, however, when she realized Duncan had never doubted her. Her answer was but a reaffirmation. Nothing more.\\n\\n The next hour was a blur of activity. While Duncan and Anthony sat at the small table inside the cottage and ate their supper, Father Berton went to explain the situation to his host, the Earl of Grinsteade.\\n\\n The earl was still hanging on to life, and though he didn\u0027t have the strength to attend the ceremony, Duncan would pay a formal visit as soon as the wedding was over.\\n\\n Duncan and his vassal walked to the lake behind the earl\u0027s home to bathe and speak to each other in private. Madelyne used the time to change her gown. She brushed her hair until it curled to her satisfaction, then decided to forget fashion and leave it unbound. She knew Duncan preferred it that way.\\n\\n She wore his colors again, of course. Her shoes and chainse were a pale cream in color, and partially covered by the hand-stitched royal blue bliaut. She\u0027d worked nearly a month on the yoke circling the neckline of the bliaut, making minute stitches, all the color of cream, of the design she wished to effect. In the center of her artwork was the outline of her magical wolf.\\n\\n Duncan probably wouldn\u0027t even notice, she thought. Warriors of his stature didn\u0027t take time to note such things. \"It\u0027s just as well,\" she admitted out loud. \"He\u0027d think me fanciful again and surely tease me.\"\\n\\n \"Who will tease you?\" Duncan asked, standing in the doorway.\\n\\n Madelyne turned, a smile on her face, and looked at her warrior. \"My wolf,\" she immediately answered. \"Is something amiss, Duncan. You look… unsettled.\"\\n\\n \"You grow more beautiful with each passing hour,\" Duncan whispered. His voice felt like a caress.\\n\\n \"And you more handsome,\" Madelyne said. She smiled at Duncan, then dared to tease him. \"I\u0027m wondering why my intended would wear black attire to his wedding though. Such a grim color,\" Madelyne announced. \"And one used for mourning. Could you be mourning your fate, milord?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-44.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favorite—a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead. \\n In the feuding English court, gentle Lady Madelyne suffered the cruel whims of her ruthless brother, Baron Louddon.
