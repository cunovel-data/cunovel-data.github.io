She continued to pace her circle, wondering how in God\u0027s name she\u0027d ever get Duncan to promise her anything.\n \"Of course not,\" Madelyne answered. She stopped when she was directly in front of Adela and smiled down at the girl. \"I\u0027d get his promise first. He\u0027ll find out the rest soon enough, won\u0027t he?\"\n Adela smiled. \"You\u0027ve a devious mind, Madelyne. I understand your plan now. Once Duncan agrees, he won\u0027t go back on his word. But he\u0027ll be furious with you for tricking him,\" she added, her smile fading over that worry.\n \"He\u0027s always furious with me,\" Madelyne answered with a shrug. \"I\u0027m not afraid of your brother, Adela. He blusters like the wind, yet there\u0027s a soft core underneath. I\u0027m sure of it,\" Madelyne said, praying to herself that she was correct. \"Now then, promise me you\u0027ll not worry about the possibility of carrying a child. You\u0027ve had an ordeal, and that could well be the reason you\u0027ve missed your monthly,\" she advised. \"I know all about this, you see, because Frieda, the woodcutter\u0027s wife, suffered a terrible upset when her boy fell down the drinking well and couldn\u0027t be gotten out for the longest time. The lad was unharmed, and thank God for that, but I heard Frieda tell another servant some two months later that she wasn\u0027t having her monthly. The other servant did explain that it was a natural enough condition considering the fright she\u0027d had. I don\u0027t remember the wise woman\u0027s name now, else I\u0027d share it with you, but she turned out to be right on the subject. Aye, Frieda was back to her usual flux the following month.\"\n Adela nodded. \"And if you do carry a babe,\" Madelyne went on, \"we\u0027ll see it through, won\u0027t we? You\u0027ll not hate the child, will you, Adela?\" Madelyne couldn\u0027t keep the worry out of her voice. \"The baby would be as innocent as you are, Adela.\"\n \"He\u0027d have a black soul, like his father,\" Adela said. \"They would share the same blood.\"\n \"Then if that is the way of it, I\u0027m damned to hell just as Louddon is, aren\u0027t I?\"\n \"Nay, you\u0027re not like your brother,\" Adela protested.\n \"And your child won\u0027t be like Morcar either. You\u0027d see to it,\" Madelyne said.\n \"How?\"\n \"By loving the baby and helping him make the right choices when he\u0027s old enough to understand.\"\n Madelyne sighed then and shook her head. \"You may not be with child anyway, so let\u0027s put the matter aside for now. I can see how tired you are. Since your room must still be cleaned before you can sleep there, you\u0027re to have my bed this night. I\u0027ll find another.\"\n Adela followed Madelyne over to the bed and watched as her new friend pulled the covers back. \"When will you ask Duncan for his promise?\"\n Madelyne waited until Adela got into bed before answering. \"I\u0027ll speak to him tomorrow. \" \u0027Tis most important to you, I can see that. I won\u0027t be forgetting.\"\n \"I don\u0027t ever want another man to touch me,\" Adela said.\n Her voice was so harsh, Madelyne began to worry she\u0027d get herself upset again.\n \"Hush, now,\" Madelyne soothed as she tucked the covers around Adela. \"Rest now. Everything is going to be all right.\"\n Adela smiled over the way Madelyne was pampering her. \"Madelyne? I\u0027m sorry for the way I\u0027ve treated you. If I thought it would help, I\u0027d ask Edmond to speak to Duncan about taking you to Scotland.\"\n Madelyne noticed Adela thought to talk to Edmond and not go directly to Duncan. That comment reinforced her belief that Adela was afraid of her eldest brother.\n Adela sighed and then said, \"I really don\u0027t want you to go anywhere just yet. I\u0027ve been so lonely. Is that selfish of me to admit?\"\n \"Only truthful,\" Madelyne returned. \"A trait I most admire,\" she added. \"Why, I\u0027ve never told a lie in all my days,\" she boasted.\n \"Not ever?\"\n Madelyne caught Adela\u0027s giggle and smiled over it. \"Not that I can recall,\" she said. \"And I promise to stay here just as long as you need me. I\u0027ve no wish to travel in this harsh weather.\"\n \"You\u0027ve also been dishonored, Madelyne. Everyone will thinkâ€¦\"\n \"\u0027Tis nonsense you speak,\" Madelyne said. \"Neither one of us is responsible for what has happened. We are both honorable enough inside our hearts. That is all that matters to me.\"\n \"You\u0027ve the most unusual attitudes,\" Adela said. \"I would think you should hate all of us Wextons.\"\n \"Well, it is a fact that your brothers aren\u0027t easy men to like,\" Madelyne admitted. \"But I don\u0027t hate them. Do you know I feel safe here? It\u0027s remarkable, isn\u0027t it? To be a captive and feel so safe at the same time. Now, that\u0027s a truth to mull over.\"\n Madelyne frowned, her mind filled with her amazing admission. \"Well now,\" she said to herself. \"I\u0027m going to have to think about this a bit longer.\"\n She patted Adela on her arm and then turned to walk to the door,\n \"You won\u0027t do anything foolish about Morcar, will you, Madelyne?\"\n \"Now, why would you ask such a thing?\" Madelyne asked.\n \"Because of the look that came over you when I told you his name,\" Adela answered. \"You won\u0027t do anything, will you?\"\n Adela sounded scared again. \"You\u0027ve an overactive imagination,\" Madelyne told her. \"That gives us something else in common,\" she added, neatly avoiding the issue of Morcar.\n Her ploy worked, for Adela was smiling again. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have nightmares tonight. I\u0027m too tired. You better come to bed soon, Madelyne. You\u0027ll need to be rested for your talk with Duncan.\"\n \"Do you think he\u0027ll drain the strength out of me?\" Madelyne asked.\n \"Not you,\" Adela answered. \"You can get Duncan to promise you anything.\"\n Lord, the sister held such confidence. Madelyne felt her shoulders slump.\n \"I see the way Duncan watches you. And you did save Gilard\u0027s life. I heard him tell Edmond the story. Remind\n Duncan of that and he wouldn\u0027t be able to deny you anything.\"\n \"Go to sleep, Adela.\"\n Madelyne was just about to pull the door closed, when Adela\u0027s next words caught her. \"Duncan never looks at Lady Eleanor the way he looks at you.\"\n Madelyne couldn\u0027t resist. \"Who is Lady Eleanor?\" she asked, trying not to sound too interested. She turned and looked over at Adela, and from the way the sister was smiling at her, she thought she might not have fooled her.\n \"The woman Duncan is thinking to marry.\"\n Madelyne showed no visible reaction. She nodded, indicating she\u0027d heard Adela.\n \"Then I\u0027m good and sorry for her. She\u0027ll have her hands full living with your brother. Do not take offense, Adela, but I believe your brother is too arrogant for his own good.\"\n \"I said he was thinking about marrying her, Madelyne. But he won\u0027t.\"\n Madelyne didn\u0027t answer. She closed the door behind her and made it across the landing before she burst into tears.\n Chapter Eleven\n \"He is best who is trained in the severest discipline.\"\n king archidamus ii of sparta\n Madelyne didn\u0027t want anyone to catch her crying. When she left Adela, she really didn\u0027t have any clear destination in mind. She only wanted to find a quiet place where she could sort out her emotions.\n The hall was her first choice, but when she approached the entrance, she heard Gilard talking to someone. She continued on, down the next flight of stairs, collected her winter cloak from the peg adjacent to the soldiers\u0027 keep, and then struggled to get the heavy doors opened just enough for her to squeeze through.\n The air was cold enough to make a bear shiver. Madelyne pulled her cloak around her shoulders and hurried on. The moon gave sufficient light for her walk, and when she\u0027d circled the butcher\u0027s hut, she leaned against the stone fortress wall and began to weep like an infant. She was loud, undisciplined, unfortunate too beacuse she didn\u0027t feel the least bit better afterward. Her head hurt, her cheeks stung, and she was consumed with hiccuping.\n The rage wouldn\u0027t go away.\n Once Adela had begun her story, she told every bit of it. Madelyne hadn\u0027t shown any visible reaction to the horror, but her heart felt close to bursting with pain. Morcar! The bastard was just as guilty as Louddon was, yet no one would ever know of his involvement.\n \"What are you doing out here?\"\n Madelyne let out a gasp. Duncan had frightened the breath right out of her, appearing out of nowhere to stand next to her.\n She tried to turn her back on him. Duncan wouldn\u0027t let her. He took hold of her chin and forced her to look up at him.\n He\u0027d have to be blind not to notice she\u0027d been crying. Madelyne thought to give him a curt excuse, but the moment he touched her, she started weeping again.\n Duncan pulled her into his arms. He seemed content to hold her until she gained control of herself. He\u0027d obviously just finished his swim, as he was dripping from head to waist. Madelyne wasn\u0027t helping him dry either, she was crying and gasping and hiccuping all over the soft mat of hair covering his chest.\n \"You\u0027re going to freeze to death walking around half naked,\" she told him between sobs. \"And I\u0027ll not warm your feet this time.\"\n If Duncan answered her, she didn\u0027t hear him. Her face was pressed against his shoulder. She was stroking his chest too. Duncan thought she didn\u0027t even realize what she was doing, or understand the effect she was having on him.\n Madelyne suddenly tried to push away from Duncan. She bumped his chin, muttered an apology, and then made the mistake of looking up at him. His mouth was entirely too close. She couldn\u0027t quit staring at it, remembering all too clearly the way he\u0027d felt when she\u0027d blatantly kissed him that night in the tent.\n She wanted to kiss him again.\n Duncan must have read her intentions, for he slowly lowered his mouth to hers.\n He meant only to give her a gentle kiss. Aye, he meant to comfort her, but Madelyne\u0027s arms went around his neck and her mouth immediately opened to him. His tongue took advantage, mating with hers.\n God, she was good. She could make him so hot so quickly. She wouldn\u0027t let him be gentle either. The sound she made, way in the back of her throat, pushed all thoughts of comfort aside.\n He felt her shiver and only then remembered where they were. Reluctantly he pulled away from Madelyne, though he fully expected an argument from her. He\u0027d have to kiss her again, he decided, and then went ahead and did just that before his soft, sensual woman even had the chance to ask.\n Duncan was making her burn. She didn\u0027t think she had the strength to stop, until his hand brushed the side of her breast. It felt wonderful, and when she realized how much more she wanted, she pulled away from him.\n \"You\u0027d best get inside before you turn to a block of ice,\" Madelyne said. Her voice sounded ragged.\n Duncan sighed. Madelyne was at it again, trying to order him around. He picked her up into his arms, ignoring her protests, and started to walk toward the castle. \"Did Adela speak to you about what happened to her?\" Duncan asked when his mind could focus again.\n \"She did,\" Madelyne answered. \"But I\u0027ll not retell a single word, no matter how insistent you become. You can torture me if you\u0027ve a wish to, yet I\u0027llâ€”\"\n \"Madelyne.\" His long-drawn-out sigh stopped her.\n \"I promised Adela I wouldn\u0027t say anything to anyone, especially you. Your sister is afraid of you, Duncan. \u0027Tis a sorry state of affairs, that,\" she added.\n She thought her announcement would anger Duncan and was surprised when he nodded. \"It\u0027s the way it should be,\" Duncan said, shrugging. \"I\u0027m lord as well as brother and the first must take preference over the second.\"\n \"It isn\u0027t the way it should be,\" Madelyne argued. \"A family should be close. They should eat all their meals together and never fight with each other. They shouldâ€”\"\n \"How the hell would you know what a family should or shouldn\u0027t do? You\u0027ve lived with your uncle,\" Duncan said, shaking his head in exasperation.\n \"Well, I still know how families should act,\" Madelyne argued. Madelyne, don\u0027t question my methods,\" Duncan said in a low growl. \"Why were you weeping?\" he asked, swiftly changing the subject.\n \"Because of what my brother did to Adela,\" Madelyne whispered. She rested her face on Duncan\u0027s shoulder. \"My brother will burn in hell for eternity.\"\n \"Aye,\" Duncan answered.\n \"He\u0027s a man in need of killing. I don\u0027t condemn you for wanting to kill him, Duncan.\"\n Duncan shook his head. \"Does it make you feel better not to condemn me?\" he asked.\n She thought she heard amusement in his voice. \"I have changed my views on killing. I was weeping because of that loss,\" she whispered. \"And for what I must do.\"\n Duncan waited for Madelyne to explain. They reached the doors. Duncan pulled one open without unsettling her. The strength in him amazed her yet again. It had taken all her determination, both hands, too, to work one of those doors open enough to slip through without catching her backside, yet Duncan hadn\u0027t shown the least bit of strain. \"What must you do?\" Duncan asked, unable to contain his curiosity. \"I must kill a man.\"\n The door slammed shut just as Madelyne whispered her confession. Duncan wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d heard her correctly. He decided he had enough patience to wait until they had reached his bedroom before questioning her further.\n He carried Madelyne up the steps, ignoring her protests that she was able to walk, didn\u0027t pause when they reached the hall level, but continued on, up to the next. Madelyne believed he was taking her back to the tower room. When they reached the mouth of the circular structure, Duncan turned in the opposite direction and continued on down a dark corridor. It was too dark to see where it led.\n She was highly curious, for she hadn\u0027t even noticed the narrow hallway. They reached the end of the corridor, and Duncan opened a door and carried Madelyne inside. It was obviously his sleeping quarters, Madelyne realized, even as she considered it most kind of him to give up his bedroom to her for this night.\n It was warm and cozy inside the bedroom. A full fire blazed in the hearth, giving heat and a soft glow to the otherwise Stark room. A single window was centered in the opposite wall, covered with an animal skin in lieu of shutters. A wide bed took up most of the stone wall adjacent to the hearth, with a chest beside it.\n The bed and chest were the only pieces of furniture in the room. It was clean, though, almost spotless. That fact made Madelyne smile. She didn\u0027t know why it pleased her but was glad that Duncan didn\u0027t like clutter any more than she did. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/honor-s-splendour/page-20.html","bookId":1841,"book":{"id":1841,"title":"Honor\u0027s Splendour","description":"Storyline: \n This classic medieval romance from New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood is a fan favoriteâ€”a beautiful lady needs rescue from a knight in shining armor, and gets an alpha warrior instead. \n In the feuding English court, gentle Lady Madelyne suffered the cruel whims of her ruthless brother, Baron Louddon.
