We signed the register the reverend offered and were given our certificate of marriage to sign as well. Gideon’s fingers brushed over it reverently.\\n\\n “Is this what you needed?” I teased him. “This piece of paper?”\\n\\n “I need you, Mrs. Cross.” He pulled me close. “I wanted this.”\\n\\n Angus took both the certificate and prenup with him when he made himself scarce. Both had been duly notarized by the hotel manager and would end up wherever Gideon kept such things.\\n\\n As for Gideon and me, we ended up in the cabana, tangled naked with each other. We sipped chilled champagne, touched each other playfully and greedily, and kissed lazily as the day crawled by.\\n\\n That was perfect, too.\\n\\n “So, how are we handling this when we get back?” I asked him, as we ate a candlelit dinner in the dining room of our suite. “The whole we-ran-off-and-got-hitched explanation.”\\n\\n Gideon shrugged and licked melted butter off his thumb. “However you want.”\\n\\n I pulled the meat out of a crab leg and considered the options. “I want to tell Cary for sure. And I think my dad will be okay with it. I kind of talked around it when I called him earlier and he told me you’d asked him, so he’s prepared. I don’t think Stanton will care much either way, no offense.”\\n\\n “None taken.”\\n\\n “I’m worried about my mom, though. Things are already rough between us. She’ll be totally stoked that we’re married”—I paused a minute, absorbing that for the millionth time—“but I don’t want her to think that I left her out because I’m mad at her.”\\n\\n “Let’s just tell her and everyone else we’re engaged.”\\n\\n I dunked the crabmeat into drawn butter, thinking I wanted to get very used to seeing Gideon shirtless and sated and relaxed. “She’ll have a conniption if we live together before the wedding.”\\n\\n “Well, then she’ll have to plan fast,” he said dryly. “You’re my wife, Eva. I don’t care if anyone else knows it or not, I know it. And I want to come home to you, have coffee in the morning with you, zip up the back of your dresses, and unzip them at night.”\\n\\n Watching him snap a crab leg with his hands, I asked, “Will you wear a wedding band?”\\n\\n “I’m looking forward to it.”\\n\\n That made me smile. He paused and stared at me.\\n\\n “What?” I prompted, when he didn’t say anything. “Do I have butter splashed on my face?”\\n\\n He sat back with a deep exhalation. “You’re beautiful. I love looking at you.”\\n\\n I felt my face heat. “You’re not so bad yourself.”\\n\\n “It’s starting to go away,” he murmured.\\n\\n My smile faded. “What? What’s going away?”\\n\\n “The … worry. It feels safe, doesn’t it?” He sipped his wine. “Settled. It’s a good feeling. I like it. A lot.”\\n\\n I hadn’t had as much time to get used to the idea of being married, but as I sat back and really thought about it, I had to agree. He was mine. No one could doubt it now. “I like it, too.”\\n\\n He lifted my hand to his lips. The ring he’d given me caught the candlelight and glimmered with multihued fire. It was a tastefully large Asscher-cut diamond in a vintage setting. I loved the timeless sophistication of it, but more so because it was the ring his father had married his mother with.\\n\\n Even though Gideon was deeply wounded by his parents’ betrayals, their time together as a family of three was the last true happiness he remembered before meeting me.\\n\\n And he swore he wasn’t romantic.\\n\\n He caught me admiring the ring. “You like it.”\\n\\n “I do.” I looked at him. “It’s one of a kind. I was thinking we could do something unusual with our home, too.”\\n\\n “Oh?” He squeezed my hand and resumed eating.\\n\\n “I understand the need to sleep apart, but I don’t like having doors and walls between us.”\\n\\n “I don’t, either, but your safety comes first.”\\n\\n “How about a master suite with two bedrooms connected by a bathroom with no doors. Just archways or passageways. So technically, we’re still in the same open space.”\\n\\n He considered that a minute, then nodded. “Draw it up and we’ll bring in a designer to make it happen. We’ll continue staying on the Upper West Side for now while we have the penthouse refinished. Cary can take a look at the adjoining one-bedroom apartment and make any changes he wants at the same time.”\\n\\n I rubbed my bare foot along the back of his calf as a thank-you. The sounds of music drifted in on the evening wind, reminding me that we weren’t alone on a deserted island.\\n\\n Was Angus having a good time somewhere? Or was he stuck standing outside the door to our suite?\\n\\n “Where’s Angus?” I asked.\\n\\n “Around.”\\n\\n “Is Raúl here, too?”\\n\\n “No. He’s in New York working out how Nathan’s bracelet ended up where it did.”\\n\\n “Oh.” I suddenly lost my appetite. Picking up my napkin, I wiped my fingers. “Should I be worried?”\\n\\n It was a rhetorical question, since I’d never stopped worrying. The mystery of who was responsible for sending the police in another direction was always there, niggling at the back of my mind.\\n\\n “Someone handed me a get-out-of-jail-free card,” he said evenly, licking his lower lip. “I expected that was going to cost me something, but no one’s approached me yet. So, I’ll approach them.”\\n\\n “Once you find them.”\\n\\n “Oh, I’ll find them,” he murmured darkly. “Then we’ll know why.”\\n\\n Beneath the table, I wrapped my legs around his and held on.\\n\\n WE danced on the beach by the light of the moon. The lush humidity was sensuous at night, and we reveled in it. Gideon shared my bed that night, even though I could tell how difficult it was for him to take the risk. I couldn’t imagine sleeping alone on my wedding night and trusted that his prescription combined with the previous night’s lack of sleep would help him sleep deeply. It did.\\n\\n Sunday, he gave me the choice of going to a fabulous waterfall or taking the resort’s catamaran out to sea or rafting down a jungle river. I smiled and told him next time, and then I had my wicked way with him.\\n\\n We lazed around all day, skinny-dipping in the private pool and napping when the mood struck us. It was after midnight when we left, and I was sorry to go. The weekend had been far too short.\\n\\n “We’ve got a lifetime of weekends,” he murmured as we drove back to the airport, reading my mind.\\n\\n “I’m selfish with you. I want you all to myself.”\\n\\n When we boarded the jet, the clothes we’d had at our disposal at the resort came with us. It made me smile, thinking of how little we’d worn over the two days.\\n\\n I took the cosmetic case into the bedroom so I could brush my teeth before sleeping the duration of the flight home. That was when I saw the patent leather and brass luggage tag attached to it, engraved with Eva Cross.\\n\\n Gideon slipped into the lavatory behind me and kissed my shoulder. “Let’s crash, angel. We need some sleep before work.”\\n\\n Pointing at the luggage tag, I said, “Was my saying yes really that much of a foregone conclusion?”\\n\\n “I was prepared to hold you hostage until you did.”\\n\\n I didn’t doubt him. “I’m flattered.”\\n\\n “You’re married.” He smacked me on the ass. “Now hurry up, Mrs. Cross.”\\n\\n I hurried and slipped into the bed beside him. He immediately spooned behind me, tucking me close.\\n\\n “Sweet dreams, baby,” I whispered, wrapping my arms over his around my middle.\\n\\n His mouth curved against my neck. “My dreams already came true.”\\n\\n 20\\n\\n IT WAS WEIRD going to work on Monday morning and having no one realize my life was profoundly different. Who knew how much saying a few words and slipping on a ring of metal could change a person’s perception of themselves?\\n\\n I wasn’t just Eva, the New York newbie trying to make it on her own in the big city with her best friend. I was a mogul’s wife. I had a whole new set of responsibilities and expectations. Just thinking about it intimidated me.\\n\\n Megumi stood as she buzzed me through the security doors at Waters Field \u0026 Leaman. She was dressed with unusual sedateness in a black sleeveless dress with an asymmetrical hemline and bright fuchsia heels. “Wow. You’ve got an amazing tan! I’m so jealous.”\\n\\n “Thanks. How’d your weekend go?”\\n\\n “Same old, same old. Michael stopped calling.” Her nose wrinkled. “I miss the harassment. Made me feel wanted.”\\n\\n I shook my head at her. “You’re nuts.”\\n\\n “I know. So tell me where you went. And did you go with the rock star or Cross?”\\n\\n “My lips are sealed.” Although I was tempted to reveal everything. The only thing that held me back was that I hadn’t told Cary yet and he needed to come first.\\n\\n “No way!” Her dark eyes narrowed. “Are you seriously not going to tell me?”\\n\\n “Of course I will.” I winked. “Just not right now.”\\n\\n “I know where you work, you know,” she called after me as I headed down the hallway to my cubicle.\\n\\n When I reached my desk, I got ready to type a quick text to Cary and discovered that he’d sent me a few over the weekend that hadn’t come through until later. They certainly hadn’t been there when I’d placed my usual Saturday call to my dad.\\n\\n Wanna have lunch? I texted.\\n\\n When I didn’t get a reply right away, I silenced my phone and set it in my top drawer.\\n\\n “Where did you spend the weekend?” Mark asked me as he came in to work. “You’ve got a great tan.”\\n\\n “Thanks. I lazed it up in the Caribbean.”\\n\\n “Really? I’ve been scoping out the islands for possible honeymoon spots. Would you recommend it for that, wherever you stayed?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/entwined-with-you-crossfire-3/page-51.html","bookId":1924,"book":{"id":1924,"title":"Entwined with You (Crossfire #3)","description":"Storyline: Entwined with You (Crossfire #3) \\n The worldwide phenomenon continues as Eva and Gideon face the demons of their pasts, and accept the consequences of their obsessive desires… \\n From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed.
