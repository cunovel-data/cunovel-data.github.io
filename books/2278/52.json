In my quest for regional food and drink, I asked my Massachusetts friends and family what they considered to be the Massachusetts traditional choice for imbibing. They all looked at me strangely and said, “Well, Sam Adams beer, of course!” So…beer drinkers, there you have it. Sam Adams!

But in recent years the inexplicable malice that once tormented so many has lain as silent as its victims. Until now.

Yet nothing could prepare her for the string of slayings once again plaguing Lexington House, or for the chief suspect ? a boy barely old enough to drive, much less kill.
