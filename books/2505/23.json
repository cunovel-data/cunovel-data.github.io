{"id":107199,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"A gelid mist hung over Sanctu-Eustachios the Hermit, not substantial enough to be called even a drizzle but more than fog; buildings were shrouded in clammy wraiths as if they were the artifacts of a ghostly dream. The little daylight that penetrated the obscuring haze was so diffuse, it was impossible to tell what time of day it was. The whole valley was silent, for the last of the monks had gone and there was no more chanting or ringing of the Mass bell to help mark the canonical Hours; no refugees called, no soldier shouted orders, no women supervised playing children. Emptiness haunted the place as much as the murkiness did. \"Do you think the straw-men are too damp to burn?\" Niklos asked Sanctu-Germainios in the Greek of his youth as they made their way around the broad space between the two walls, carrying large jugs of oil; they would ladle the oil over each of the dummies. In the hush, his voice sounded unnaturally loud. Sanctu-Germainios shifted his pluvial of waxed wool more tightly around his shoulders and scrutinized the moist air. \"If the rain does not grow heavier, and the Huns arrive before mid-day we ought to - \" \"And how do we know when it\u0027s mid-day?\" Niklos spoke sharply. \"I don\u0027t like this weather, and I don\u0027t like having to wait for the Huns to try to kill us.\" \"Before the last of the men left at the end of the night, the guards in the gate-tower saw a large company of mounted men moving up the Roman road. Making allowances for the weather - as you mentioned - they should be here about mid-day, since they will not risk coming too rapidly, with visibility so poor,\" said Sanctu-Germainios as calmly as he could. \"You heard the guards.\" He climbed up the ladder onto the battlement walkway, carrying the jug of oil carefully so as not to spill any of its contents. \"How do we know that the men they saw were Huns? They could be Goths, or Gepidae, or Daci, or Carpi. Or any number of other refugees.\" Niklos followed him up. \"They could be,\" Sanctu-Germainios allowed. \"But it is unlikely; most refugees are trying to cross into Roman territory, not go to ground here.\" He poured a ladle of oil over the nearest straw- man. \"There is an advantage to the damp: it will tend to keep the fire from spreading.\" \"That is most worthwhile,\" said Niklos with heavy sarcasm, \"considering.\" \"Dying in fire would be the True Death for us both,\" Sanctu-Germainios observed. \"I\u0027m aware of it,\" said Niklos brusquely. \"That\u0027s what I mean. What good is it to escape the Huns if we are killed by fire?\" He straightened the next straw-man before emptying his ladle over the shoulders of the figure. \"I reckon that\u0027s why Nicoris changed her mind about staying; you told her what we were planning to do.\" \"Not all of it, but enough,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"She knows that you and I may not... be able to leave here.\" \"She might be attacked on the road, or have to fight the Huns in another place,\" said Niklos. \"That is why I asked her to go with Neves and his men. She would have a greater chance with a company of armed men than with just the two of us. She saw the advantages of that.\" \"Don\u0027t you want her here, with you?\" Niklos dared to ask. \"If everything were settled and the monastery still a haven, then yes. But as matters stand, this is not her risk to take; she deserves protection, and here I cannot give it to her.\" He paused. \"I hope I have done what will spare her from harm.\" \"And I suppose you paid Neves and his men to guard her?\" Niklos guessed aloud. \"She is safer with Neves and his men than she would be here,\" Sanctu-Germainios reiterated, no emotion in his voice; he told himself again, as he had told her, that he did not want to be the cause of the death that would bring her to his life. \"I guess that means you did pay them, and knowing you, very well,\" said Niklos, saying nothing more as he continued on until he reached the next ladder. \"Do we do the figures on the outer wall as well?\" \"As many of them as we have time to; oil will keep them burning in spite of the damp,\" Sanctu-Germainios replied, wondering if Niklos would be willing not to remind him of Nicoris; his anxiety for her had been growing since she had left with Neves and his mercenaries. He concentrated on his immediate situation, trying not to fret for Nicoris. \"Once the Huns break through the outer wall we - \" \" - set these on the inner wall alight, and then the dormitories, and under cover of the flames, we make our way toward the lake, setting fire to the straw-men on the outer wall, trapping the Huns between the two blazes - that is, if the Huns cooperate. If they fight from outside the walls, we will have to think of another way.\" He coughed to express his discomfort at that notion. To keep from dwelling on their chance of failure, he said, \"I trust our horses are well enough concealed to escape the notice of the Huns, otherwise we\u0027ll be in a worse situation than we are now. I don\u0027t wish to try to get out of the mountains on foot, not with the Huns about.\" \"One of the hermits has them in his cave. I gave him feed and water for the five animals: three horses and two mules; they are saddled, bridled, haltered, and laden: we can ride as soon as we reach the cave. For his service, I offered Monachos Guilielmos the last wheel of cheese from the larder - the one Monachos Vlasos left for us - and the gold crucifix from the wall of the refectory. Money would have insulted him.\" He followed Niklos down the ladder. \"Do you think the hermit is reliable? Does he have any idea of what could happen here if he fails us?\" Niklos\u0027 nervousness was becoming more apparent; he fidgeted with the tails of his belt. \"He used to be a merchants\u0027 factor before his family died of pustulant fever: he may be a little mad, but he knows the importance of this duty.\" Niklos nodded, going on an instant later, \"Do you think we\u0027ll be able to get out of this place unnoticed?\" \"I hope we can. The weather favors us.\" His hand slid around the hilt of the Byzantine long-sword hanging from his belt in a scabbard. \"I have a dozen caltrops as well, and a dagger.\" He tapped the satchel slung across his shoulder. \"Then you anticipate a fight,\" said Niklos. \"Not necessarily, but I am prepared for one, just as you are,\" Sanctu-Germainios said as they crossed the narrowest part of the space between the two stockades. \"Do you think we\u0027re being watched now?\" Niklos asked, hesitating a little as they reached the outer wall. \"In this?\" Sanctu-Germainios waved his free hand through the air. \"They are welcome to try: I can barely make out the stable from here.\" Niklos made a sound between a laugh and a sigh. \"Why have they waited so long? They must suspect the monastery is empty.\" \"Very likely they do. They want to strike when the monastery is most exposed and its defenses are at their weakest.\" He stopped at the foot of the ladder and looked closely at Niklos. \"You know this. Why do you continue to - \" \"Pester you? For reassurance. I don\u0027t know you well, but I realize that you\u0027re not like Olivia. You are a self-contained man, you don\u0027t reveal yourself as readily as she does. You keep your own counsel. If you are hopeful or discouraged, you make no show of either. You don\u0027t dissemble, but you aren\u0027t forthcoming, either. Olivia is much more open; she opines on everything. You puzzle me often, she never. I\u0027ve tried to discern your purpose, and half the time I\u0027m unable to figure it out. So I tell you what I understand and hope you\u0027ll confirm it for me.\" He turned away, shocked at his own outburst. \"I intend no disrespect, Dom.\" Sanctu-Germainios contemplated Niklos\u0027 restless movements, saying at last, \"I did not think you did.\" He began to climb toward the battlement walkway. \"We will be through here shortly. Then we can take our place on the battlements to watch for the arrival of the Huns.\" \"What if they don\u0027t come?\" Niklos asked. \"What do we do then?\" \"If the Huns are not here by nightfall, we will set fire to the walls, collect our horses and mules, and take the southern hunters\u0027 track leading toward Drobetae.\" \"In the dark?\" Niklos climbed up behind Sanctu-Germainios. \"Why don\u0027t we just set fire to the place and leave now?\" \"Because the Huns would know that the fire had been set, and they would search for us. Given their numbers, they would find us.\" He reached the walkway, turned, and offered his hand to Niklos, pulling him up the last few rungs with no apparent effort. Niklos swallowed once, hard, then scowled. \"I\u0027ll try not to keep badgering you, Dom.\" \"And I will try to explain myself,\" Sanctu-Germainios promised him as they began their work of applying oil to as many of the straw- men as possible. They had completed half of their task when the sound of hoof-beats reached them, at a distance, but moving at a trot. \"Huns,\" said Niklos. \"Down the ladder. Leave the jugs. We need our torches.\" Sanctu-Germainios had already dropped his and was making for the ladder, his satchel swinging along his side. \"At the gate-tower?\" \"Yes. Hurry.\" He was on the ground, prepared to run. \"Hurry,\" he repeated, starting away from the outer wall with amazing speed. Niklos rushed after him, but could not keep pace with Sanctu-Germainios \u0027 uncanny speed. He continued to run with dogged purpose, reaching the gate-tower as Sanctu-Germainios emerged from the tower onto the battlement walkway, a burning torch in his hand. \"Are you going to light them now?\" \"No; as soon as they break through the outer wall; we need as many of them in the space between the walls as possible,\" Sanctu-Germainios answered. \"For now, will you go to the monks\u0027 church and ring the bell twice?\" \"Why?\" \"So that it may seem that there are more men here than is actually the case; the longer they are confused, the better it is for us,\" came his answer. \"Then go to the alarm and sound it loudly, so that it might seem that there are soldiers still here to defend this place.\" \"All right,\" said Niklos, and ran off to the monks\u0027 church. He found the bell-rope quickly, rang it twice, then rushed on to the courtyard between the dormitories where the alarm hung. He struck the hanging brass tube four times with the mallet beside it, and for a moment he could no longer hear the sounds of horsemen approaching. \"They\u0027re coming up the river track,\" he said to himself, troubled by the ease with which the Huns were advancing. With the main approach still blocked by the rock-fall, the river track was the most well-marked and the easiest of all the hunters\u0027 trails. He heard the abrupt orders shouted to the horsemen; the sound goaded him into speeding back to the gate-tower and up the ladder. \"Do you see them?\" he asked as he came up to Sanctu-Germainios on the platform. \"Not clearly. They are too far away from us for me to determine what - \" He stared intently. \"They are gathering at the top of the lake, and that should bring them to the makeshift gate in the outer wall.\" His night-seeing eyes were less hampered by the dark, but the mist blurred all that moved in the distance. \"Do you think they know about the stockade getting burned by Monachos Anatolios?\" Niklos looked directly at the torch flaming near them in its iron sconce. \"If the spy inside the monastery did not tell them, their scouts must have done so,\" Sanctu-Germainios said. \"Doesn\u0027t that worry you?\" Niklos demanded, finding comfort in talking more than in any response he was given. \"Yes, it does, but for now, I must put my attention on the problems actually confronting us here, not on what I speculate could happen. We have anticipated as much as we could, and done what we can to prepare for any contingency.\" He thought back to the many battles he had fought, in his native land, in Anatolia, in Egypt, in Greece, in Gaul, and as quickly as he recalled them he wished them away, knowing he needed to center his vigilance on the Huns and the stratagem he hoped would succeed. He realized that Niklos wanted to hear more from him, so he said, \"You know what our plans are; you can carry them out whether I am able to or not. Use your good sense and you will win free of this place.\" Niklos glowered. \"You\u0027re not planning something rash, are you? - something I don\u0027t know about. Something Olivia wouldn\u0027t approve.\" \"I am planning to do the things we have agreed upon, but that does not mean that the Huns will permit us to best them.\" He went silent, listening to the shouts and war-cries of the Huns as they started up from the lake toward the damaged outer wall of the monastery. \"I wish this fog would lift,\" said Niklos, needing to keep conversing. \"I hope it will not,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"The less the Huns see clearly the better for us.\" He drew his sword. \"Get ready.\" Niklos took hold of the battle-axe that had been slung across his back; he unfastened the hook and swung the weapon around. \"Ready,\" he said, and started along the battlements, working his way toward the mid-section of the inner wall. \"At least it is damp enough to render their bows inefficient,\" Sanctu-Germainios said as he checked the straw-men along the wall. \"The damp softens their bow-strings, doesn\u0027t it,\" said Niklos to show he grasped Sanctu-Germainios\u0027 meaning. \"Yes. Just as it softens the skeins on the ballistas.\" He went into the small tower that stood at the half-way point along the inner wall; he climbed up to the platform and peered into the thickening fog. \"I can see about thirty mounted men headed this way, but I hear many more than that.\" Niklos listened. \"Many more than thirty,\" he agreed, becoming restive. \"A lot of men for the two of us to take on.\" Sanctu-Germainios swung his sword, testing its heft. \"Wait until most of them are inside - \" \" - the outer wall. I remember,\" he said testily, although he knew he had been about to set the oil-soaked straw-men alight. Sanctu-Germainios listened, his full attention on the sound of the company of Huns. \"There are more arriving, I would guess another forty,\" he said a little bit later as he came down from the platform. \"They are about to circle the outer wall, to decide where to break through.\" \"Do you think they\u0027ll set the wall on fire?\" Niklos asked. \"You mean before we do?\" Sanctu-Germainios shook his head. \"No. They are not carrying torches. Take heed of everything you hear.\" \"Do you want to remain here, or shall we - \" \"We should stay in position until we know where the Huns will break through. Keep in the cover of the tower if you can. The longer we can remain undetected, the more chance we have to get away. We do not want to draw their attention yet.\" Sanctu-Germainios motioned for Niklos to be silent. \"They have started to move.\" The noise of their horses\u0027 hooves grew louder, pulsing like the sea. There were occasional shouts as the van of the company followed around the outer wall toward the gate-tower, their mounts at the canter. Niklos was still, as much from fear as in response to Sanctu-Germainios \u0027 order. \"There\u0027re more than a hundred of them.\" \"At least a hundred,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"I think there may be as many as one hundred fifty.\" That total increased Niklos\u0027 dread. \"So many.\" He lapsed into a brief silence. \"Do you think we\u0027ll actually get away?\" \"I hope we will,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, lifting his sword again. \"The more we can avoid confrontation the greater our chances are.\" A wailing cry arose from the Huns as they encircled the outer wall, a sound similar to the howls of wolves, but deeper and more menacing. There was very little echo, which made the sound yet more disconcerting. \"What if they don\u0027t come in the new gate? If they come in the gate-tower, how will we get to the outer wall to set the second straw- men afire?\" \"I hope they will take the new gate; it is less formidable than the main gate. The new gate is better-placed for a raid, as well, since it allows the Huns to reach the river track without being exposed to defensive assault. It is the easiest to bring down, as well.\" Sanctu-Germainios moved quickly, rising in the archers\u0027 niche to look out on the enemy horsemen. A sudden, shattering moan punctuated by axe-blows rent the air; the Huns not at the new gate went rushing back to it to help to break it down. A few of them were screaming encouragement to their comrades. The battering continued for a short while, then the wood groaned and cracked. \"Be ready. They will get through quickly, now the gate is gone.\" Sanctu-Germainios seized his torch. Niklos was shaken; the determined vehemence of the horsemen scared him badly; to reassure himself, he muttered, \"Light these straw-men, then down to the dormitories and set them on fire. Then, using the smoke for cover, go to the outer wall and light the straw-men there before we go out through the open gate.\" \"Exactly,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"You will need your torch.\" \"I have it,\" he said, trying not to listen to the new gate being pulled apart, the cheers of the Huns marking its destruction more than the scrape and thud of its collapse. The clamor of the Huns grew louder as they poured through the hole left in the wall, fanning out as they got into the space between the two walls. Most of the men rode toward the small fields and the paddocks and pens, where their jubilant victory turned to wrath as they discovered that the livestock was gone and the fields were empty. \"Now,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, and flung his torch some distance along the wall into two straw-men fastened over a small catapult; the figures seemed to resist the flames; the torch began to smoke. \"What do we - ?\" Niklos whispered, watching as a number of Huns rode toward the inner wall, drawn by the noise and the momentary flare of light. \"Wait; wait,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. He started toward the ladder, observing the straw-men expectantly. \"Keep your torch out of sight. Stay in the tower.\" \"But you - \" Niklos began, only to be interrupted by a whump as the two straw-men startlingly flared alight. The Huns pulled back from the inner wall and the spreading tongues of fire that fanned out from the two figures along the walkway to the next straw-man held in place; the first sparks struck. Abruptly one of the nearest Huns shouted something, and the words passed among the ranks in troubled, angry yells. \"Niklos! Come!\" Sanctu-Germainios called to him from the foot of the ladder. \"Bring your torch.\" \"Right!\" Niklos replied, seizing his torch from its sconce, thrusting the handle of his axe through his belt, and descending as rapidly as he could. He was a little breathless as he touched the ground and accounted for it by the presence of increasing smoke instead of keyed-up nerves. \"They know, don\u0027t they?\" \"That the figures on the battlements are dolls? It seems so.\" Sanctu-Germainios opened the tower door a slit and watched the Huns milling, most of them keeping their distance from the increasing fury of the fire. \"They\u0027ll see us if we run for the dormitories. We\u0027re on foot.\" Niklos bit his lip to stop talking. \"Then we wait until the smoke is a bit thicker. They will stay away from it, and it will cover our - \" Much of the inner stockade was starting to burn, and the first two straw-men were little more than ash; one of the Huns threw a spear into one of the figures, and screamed out incomprehensible words as the straw-man tore open. \"They\u0027re furious,\" Niklos said. \"They dislike being fooled,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"And they do not want to leave here empty-handed.\" The Huns retreated to the open space between the dormitories, crowded close together, watching the inner wall nervously. From his place at the tower door, Sanctu-Germainios saw the horsemen milling, their perplexity increasing with the fire. \"We can move shortly.\" \"Good; I\u0027m getting hot,\" Niklos complained, for the nearness of the flames rattled what little equanimity he had been able to maintain. \"The stockade is starting to burn.\" \"Yes; the fire is getting nearer than the Huns,\" said Sanctu-Germainios . He raised his head, staring up into the thickening air. \"There will be guards at the edge of the main company,\" he said, then slipped out of the door. \"Be aware of them. They are the most dangerous for us.\" \"Why?\" Niklos asked, more from jitteriness than any lack of understanding. \"They must know that there are still people here,\" said Sanctu-Germainios . \"How else would that fire get started? In this weather it could hardly be an accident. So the guards will be looking for us.\" He edged away from the tower, through the roiling smoke, going toward the largest dormitory; he could hear Niklos\u0027 soft steps behind him. He was relieved that neither he nor Niklos had to breathe, for it meant they would not cough as the smoke became denser. He touched the side of the dormitory and felt for the large pile of rags he had laid at the door after the last party of refugees and monks had left. They had been soaked in pitch and would burn quickly and tenaciously as soon as Niklos put his torch to them. \"What do you think? Do I light them now?\" Niklos almost ran into him. \"Yes. The stack is right - \" He stopped, shoved Niklos away, and swung his sword, feeling its impact and hearing a yelp of pain and surprise, followed at once by the whump of a body falling. Niklos had staggered a few paces away, his torch still clutched in his hand, its light revealing a Hunnic warrior splayed on the ground, a deep gash in his abdomen. Niklos gawked at the dying man. \"Did he almost - \" \"He did his best,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, wiping the blood from his Byzantine blade. \"If he has found us, others might. Get the pitch burning, and we will go on to the outer wall.\" The Hun on the ground moaned, but the sound was weak; blood fountained ever more slowly from the wound across the middle of his body. Niklos shuddered. \"The dormitory and the outer wall.\" He thrust his torch into the pile of rags, holding it there until it smoldered, sparked, and combusted. Niklos jumped back and almost slipped in the spreading pool of blood around the fallen Hun. \"Compose yourself,\" Sanctu-Germainios told him, not unkindly. \"You can crumple when we are safely out of here.\" It was a demanding effort, but Niklos managed to gather his scattering thoughts. \"I\u0027m ready.\" \"Good.\" He looked around the end of the dormitory. \"Keep as near to the next building as you can. The smoke is not as thick on the other side.\" \"Shouldn\u0027t we wait until there\u0027s more smoke?\" Niklos knew the answer, but had to ask the question. \"If there were fewer Huns or more of us, yes; we cannot afford to give them any opportunity to regroup and start an organized hunt for us.\" He hesitated, then added, \"Your torch and your axe are both necessary to our escape.\" Niklos ducked his head. \"I\u0027ll be right behind you.\" Sanctu-Germainios pointed in the direction they were to go. \"Once the second dormitory is alight, then on to the outer wall.\" \"I know,\" said Niklos, trying to ignore the howls and shouts of the Huns, and the crackling roar of the fire. As soon as he broke from cover of the dormitory, Sanctu-Germainios turned around as he ran, taking in all the increasing chaos between the walls of the monastery. He stayed as close to the surging smoke as he could, and slammed into the side of the next dormitory. He sought out the entrance to the building, and felt for the pile of rags as Niklos thumped into him. \"These,\" he said, pointing to the pile of rags. Niklos shoved the torch into the rags, and tried to keep from fretting while he waited for the rags to light. \"The Huns are gathering in front of the stable.\" \"I saw,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, gesturing to Niklos to move on as the fire came alive. \"The wall; by the hunters\u0027 door.\" Sanctu-Germainios slapped his arm. \"Go!\" He watched Niklos rush off into the smoky mist, then went after him, his sword up, to ensure Niklos as much protection as he could provide. They were almost at the outer wall when two mounted Huns bore down on them, thin, metal-tipped lances aimed at them. \"Keep on!\" he yelled to Niklos, then drew out three caltrops from his small satchel and flung them in the path of the charging horses, and an instant later saw the first horse rear, screaming, throwing his rider, and then rearing again as his on-side hoof touched the ground. The second Hun drew rein, prepared to turn about and summon help. Sanctu-Germainios reached into his satchel, pulled out the dagger, and struck the second Hun between the shoulder-blades. The man jerked in the saddle, then sagged and slid off his horse, which went trotting, head up and ears back, toward the rest of the company. The first Hun lay unconscious, while his horse continued to shriek in pain. Niklos appeared at Sanctu-Germainios\u0027 side, his torch gone, his battle-axe in his hands. \"Let me take care of the horse,\" he said, distressed at its suffering. \"I will do it. You go open the hunters\u0027 door.\" Without waiting for a response, he swung his sword and went up to the wretched animal, cutting its throat in a tremendous upward swipe of his sword. He backed away as the horse fell, blood spraying in all directions. He looked toward the outer wall and saw one of the straw-men burning. There was no time to lose, for the hunters\u0027 door was directly beneath the part of the walkway already smoking. He bolted toward the hunters\u0027 door just as a few more Huns rode toward him. Those in the lead reached the caltrops, and crippled their mounts, one of the men screaming as he fell onto another caltrop. Sanctu-Germainios continued on, half-expecting to be fatally impaled on a lance before he could get out of the monastery. \"This way!\" Niklos shouted, and Sanctu-Germainios ran toward the sound of his voice, lurching through the door as the battlement platform started to rain burning embers down on the Huns behind him. Once outside the door, Sanctu-Germainios shoved Niklos ahead of him toward the narrow trail that led to the hermits\u0027 caves. Within the walls there was increasing panic as the Huns strove to get out of the new gate they had come in before the entire wall was blazing. \"It will all be gone before nightfall,\" Sanctu-Germainios remarked, pausing to look back. \"Unless it starts to rain,\" Niklos reminded him. \"Our horses and mules are waiting,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. As they climbed away from the fire, the smoke lessened, the heat vanished, and Sanctu-Germainios and Niklos were less than shadows in the mist. Text of a report from Hredus in the Hunnic camp near Potaissa, to Verus Flautens, Praetor-General of Drobetae in the former Province of Dacia, written in the regional Gothic/Latin dialect with fixed ink on vellum, delivered ten months after being dispatched. To the Praetor-General of Drobetae from the freedman Hredus, To Verus Flautens, Ave: This is to warn you to evacuate all Roman citizens in the former Province of Dacia to safer towns and forts south of the Danuvius River before the autumn rains make the roads impassable. The Hunnic King, Attila, has been taking advantage of the slow response from Roman officials and troops; he intends for his lieutenants to drive toward all the Roman towns north of the Danuvius before winter. Since there are insufficient forces to stop them, the best course is to remove the Romans in this region from the path of danger. If only the Thirteenth Legion were still at Apulum to defend those faithful to the Roman Empire, East and West. Attila has paid the Praetor Custodis of Viminacium, Gnaccus Tortulla, handsomely to keep his troops south of the Danuvius, so any help you seek from him will surely be denied or postponed until all action is futile. In the meantime, Attila himself has taken his best companies and gone westward to strike at the Roman borders from here to Aquitania. So it is that Huns are growing in strength daily, not only from an increase of their own numbers but from nobles and officers in the region giving their loyalty to Attila in exchange for rank and favor. Not three days ago, Tribune Rotlandus Bernardius of Ulpia Traiana arrived here with fourteen of his soldiers, and was welcomed as a hero not only by the Huns but by the Gepidae and Goths who have joined Attila\u0027s companies of foreign allies. Bernardius informed Attila\u0027s advisors that the Sanctu-Eustachios the Hermit monastery is all but deserted and ripe for the picking, and that if a company of soldiers were dispatched at once, the remaining goods and treasure could be taken without any true opposition; it would gain the valley and lake for the Huns, and the advantage of a place high enough to offer a superior view of the whole region. Since the monastery can be reached in two days\u0027 steady riding, a company was ordered out, charged with that task. They are expected back in five days with plunder from the monastery, especially foodstuffs and livestock. Tribune Bernardius is not the only Roman officer assisting in the dismantling of the former province: I have seen three Praetors, seven column commanders, fifteen Tribunes other than Bernardius, twenty-two Centurions, and in excess of fifty soldiers. There are even nine scribe-monks and four former tax collectors among those who have made themselves allies of the Huns. They are shown respect and offered titles and privilege for their treachery. This camp has upwards of four thousand men - a considerable number with Attila and many of his troops gone westward - and as many horses in it; all of them have the smell of victory and plunder in their nostrils; it is well-known that the intention of Attila is to have his men take and hold all the towns, villages, forts, and monasteries in this part of the Carpathian Mountains while his army makes its main push to the towns the Huns do not yet control. I have seen that Attila has been altering his methods of fighting to give him equal footing against Roman and Byzantine soldiers, increasing the danger they pose to us all. They have already surrounded more than half of the territory in these mountains that they wish to hold and there are only a few safe roads out of the Hunnic noose. For that reason, I will have to send this to Aquincum with instructions to have it carried to Drobetae by courier, and pray that none of the Hunnic armies have got to Aquincum or Drobetae ahead of the courier. I trust you will have it in time to make arrangements for your defense before winter sets in. I will leave camp after the first snow and I will hope to greet you at the start of the New Year, when I look forward to the reward you have promised me for my clandestine service to you and to all Roma. And I trust that when I see you, I will find my sister well. This on the eighth day before the Autumnal Equinox, Hredus","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burning-shadows-saint-germain-23/page-23.html","bookId":2505,"book":{"id":2505,"title":"Burning Shadows (Saint-Germain #23)","description":"Storyline: Burning Shadows (Saint-Germain #23) In Burning Shadows, Yarbro looks at the legendary Huns from the perspective of the people who faced the brunt of their attacks.
