{"id":107171,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Aquileia spread out along the gentle rise above the upper end of the Adriatic Sea, a magnificent city, as elegant as Roma at her grandest, the handsomest port in all of the old Empire. It was the home to successful merchants and the newer nobility, and it showed their prosperity to advantage. Nothing about it suggested the trials that the Roman Empire in the West was undergoing, or that the true authority in the region was the Ostrogothic, not Roman; Aquileia remained lovely and serene. Even in March, the city turned the blustery weather into a setting for adventure and intrepid undertakings. From the vantage-point of the open-ended atrium of her main house at her estate, Atta Olivia Clemens watched the sea through the peristyle; some two leagues away it was a dark slate-blue flecked with foam under thickening clouds and a freshening wind. It was a little past mid-day, and the light was already fading behind the clouds. Contemplating the gathering storm, she gave herself over to apprehension. The day\u0027s chill made no impact upon her, though the tenor of her reverie left her shivering, and the threat of rain before midafternoon only served to sharpen her worry for her most enduring friend - Sanct\u0027 Germain Franciscus, Sanctu-Germainios, whatever he called himself - an emotion she made no effort to conceal as she addressed her bondsman, Niklos Aulirios. \"They say the Huns are moving farther into the Carpathians, where neither Roma nor Constantinople is likely to reinforce the barbarians against them; it is not a good turn of events for Sanct\u0027 Germain, or any other client of Roma still living in the old provinces,\" she remarked as she studied the distant expanse of water. \"The merchants report that the Hunnic plan supposes that there will be no new troops sent to aid the remaining Romans, although how they can be certain of it, I can\u0027t imagine.\" The Latin she and Niklos spoke was more than a century out of date. \"They pass through garrison towns coming south. They probably hear things,\" said Niklos. \"Do you want to go in? The wind\u0027s getting stronger.\" \"Not yet.\" She continued to stare. \"It doesn\u0027t seem very Roman, leaving the enclaves in the old provinces to fend for themselves.\" \"It could be worse than that: if the Huns can persuade more of the Goths and Gepids to join with them, they\u0027ll have fewer enemies to fight, and a better chance to find towns to serve as camps for them, to make their campaign against those towns that won\u0027t surrender more easily prosecuted,\" said Niklos, handing her a fan-folded scroll. \"The inventories from winter. And the annual purchasing accounts.\" \"Very good; I\u0027ll review them properly in a short while, once I go inside,\" she said, taking them from him and studying the first open part of the fan. \"You don\u0027t think any of the remaining Romans would surrender, do you?\" \"Why not?\" Niklos answered. \"The Huns don\u0027t tax, and they reward good service, or so I\u0027ve been told. Many have gone over to them.\" \"Um,\" said Olivia as a sign that she was reserving judgment. \"What else do you have for me?\" \"I have the sales figures from the harvest, and an accounting of the cost of the household for the previous year. There are recommendations for this year\u0027s planting to come. And the report on mares in foal and cows with calf.\" He smiled as he pulled out a small bound ledger. \"Is this Aristarchion\u0027s work?\" The fussy Greek kept most of the estate\u0027s records, and had done so for more than twenty years. \"It is, as always.\" Niklos chuckled. \"You know Aristarchion: he says every year he\u0027ll take an apprentice, and every year he puts it off again.\" \"I think he will need one this year. His handwriting looks like spider-webs, and his eyesight is beginning to fail,\" she said, scanning the faint, angular scrawl. A sharp gust of wind almost pulled the fan-folded scrolls from her hands. Taking a firmer hold, she said, \"I think it might be better to go in. The weather is turning.\" \"I agree,\" said Niklos, nodding toward the door leading to her book-room. \"Do you want the fire in the holocaust built up?\" \"It would probably be wise. If the floors get cold, the whole house is miserable.\" She held the scrolls close to her chest while her lilac-colored woollen palla and trabea fluttered in the rising wind. \"And order a small vat of wine heated and spiced for the household.\" \"As you like,\" said Niklos, holding the door open for her. \"Do you think this will bring snow in the mountains?\" \"It seems likely. Travel will soon be hard.\" She slipped indoors and touched her fawn-brown hair, knowing it was tousled beyond any excuse of fashion. \"It might be best to have the grooms bring the horses in, and the mules.\" Then, as she regarded the clouds through narrowed eyes, \"Better get the cattle into the barn and the sheep into their sheds. This is going to be a bad night.\" \"I\u0027ll see the men are set to it,\" Niklos assured her. \"What can I get for you?\" She saw the sly shine in his eyes and she wagged her finger at him. \"Don\u0027t you go playing with me, Niklos. You know that I am hungry, but I won\u0027t prey upon anyone of my household. Later this evening, if you will seek out Italicus Erbertus when he returns from the markets, and ask him to join me in my withdrawing room, I believe I may relieve my hunger without any intrusions among my servants and slaves, and to his satisfaction as well as mine.\" \"Bondama Clemens,\" Niklos responded with a respectful lowering of his head, modified by a quick wink, \"would I even so much as imply such a thing about you? We have been together long enough that I know you will not approach anyone who would dislike your way of taking nourishment.\" \"And yet you have doubts about Italicus Erbertus,\" she said. \"I suspect you do, too,\" he said with a more serious mien. \"I doubt he\u0027ll be here tonight, given the weather that\u0027s developing. There are inns in Aquileia that will keep him fed, and warm, and dry. He\u0027s not a man to put himself out when he has no inspiration to do so.\" \"I am not sufficient inspiration?\" she asked. \"I doubt he would risk traveling in pouring rain to spend the night with you, not when he need not do so.\" \"Another aspect of the man you have your doubts about?\" Olivia prodded. \"Enough to caution you. Do you question my motives?\" \"Only when you want to beleaguer me,\" she replied baldly. \"Or when you disapprove of my choices for a partner.\" She studied Niklos\u0027 face. \"Why do you object to Italicus Erbertus?\" Niklos stood still for a long moment, his remarkably handsome features still. \"I don\u0027t know precisely what it is that bothers me, but I can\u0027t quiet the vexation he rouses in me. He\u0027s a bit too smug - but he\u0027s a successful merchant, after all, and such men are often smug. He\u0027s boastful about women - but so is almost every other man in Aquileia, so that isn\u0027t the cause, little as I like his manner. In that regard, he behaves as if he is lord of your estate - but so have others before him. It may be that he is unworthy of you, or that I don\u0027t believe he will keep your secret.\" He shrugged, his expression puzzled. \"It may be all of those things, or none. But there is something badly amiss in him. Be careful of him, Olivia.\" Neither of them thought it odd that her bondsman would call her by her personal name; he would not have done it had they been overheard. \"I will, but I think you\u0027re being over-cautious.\" \"As you are with Sanct\u0027 Germain,\" he suggested. She tried to smile and almost managed it. \"I take your point. I wonder,\" she added in a more speculative tone, \"if I would care half so much about the Huns if Sanct\u0027 Germain weren\u0027t in their path.\" \"Wait until he is safe and find out.\" He escorted her to the couch near the main table in the room. \"If you want to lie down for a bit, I\u0027ll see to the securing of the house, and then I\u0027ll report to you.\" He took a blanket from the foot of the couch and opened it. \"I will be glad to recline for a while; there is so much to do later,\" she said, exaggerating a yawn as she came up to the three couches in front of the empty hearth and chose the one with the most cushions. She sat down and prepared to lean back. \"I suppose I\u0027ll be up most of the night.\" Niklos grinned. \"That will depend upon the storm, I think. Let me put the estate in order for you while you recruit yourself. May you have a pleasant rest, Bondama.\" \"Niklos, stop it,\" she admonished him playfully. \"You are too willing to make light of our position.\" \"Not I,\" he objected. \"I know that we must not remain here for more than a decade, or anywhere else, for that matter. You are older than I am, but our ages are sufficiently beyond the average that we would not want to be subject to scrutiny. And longevity is the least of it.\" He took the blanket and held it up for her as she settled onto the couch. \"I\u0027ll deal with the stable and then the household.\" \"You are good to me, Niklos.\" She lay back as if prepared to nap, but there was only acuity in her gaze. \"When you return, we must consider Sanct\u0027 Germain\u0027s problems more closely.\" He touched his forehead respectfully and left her alone on the couch, her household records held closely to her chest. Moving out through the atrium, he shouted to summon grooms and cowmen to him, snapping out orders as he went toward the stable. \"The storm will be upon us shortly,\" said Tarquinus, the head- groom. \"It will be best to get the animals in.\" \"So Bondama Clemens thinks,\" said Niklos, helping to pull open the side-doors of the stable. \"And have the youngsters round up the ducks and chickens; get them into their coops.\" \"That I will. We should be closed up before the rain begins.\" \"And have warm mash for the horses tonight,\" Niklos added, hurrying on to the barn on the far side of the stable, where the cowmen were already herding their charges into the building. \"Make sure you have hay enough for them. Check the loft. Get rid of the rats if you find any.\" \"There are always rats,\" said Bynum, the cowman from Gaul who was in charge of the barn. \"But we\u0027ll kill as many as we can. We have ten cats to help us, and that scrappy dog Darios brought from the market.\" \"Very good. Make sure the windows have their shutters in place, and barred closed.\" Niklos went on to the sheep-sheds and the pigpens, making a cursory sweep of them, then he circled around back toward the main house. He stopped on the way to urge four young slaves to close the shutters on the windows of the house. \"Then get indoors yourselves.\" \"Yes, Major Domo,\" said two of them at the same time. Niklos knew it was useless to remind them that he was not the major domo for the estate - that titled belonged to Sylvandrus Polli and had for eight years - but the personal bondsman to Atta Olivia Clemens, the owner of the estate and all it contained. There was no reason to stop and explain again; he kept on, passing the footman as he entered the house on his right foot. \"Make sure the door-l amp has enough oil to last the night, Sergius.\" \"And there will be someone manning the door until the weather clears,\" Sergius pledged, trying not to cough. \"Get yourself to Briareus and have him give you some tincture of hawthorn-and-honey. You don\u0027t want that cough to get worse.\" \"Yes, Bondsman,\" said Sergius, still doing his utmost not to cough. Niklos went to the kitchens and summoned the main cook. \"It is going to be a hard night, Patricius. Make sure there is a cauldron of hearty soup simmering all through the night. We may have travelers arrive.\" \"Not willing to go all the way into Aquileia,\" remarked the cook. \"Not in the middle of a bad storm, no,\" Niklos agreed. \"Have you seen Sylvandrus Polli about?\" \"He went to the cellars at mid-day. He may still be there. Aristarchion is with him.\" \"I\u0027ll find them once we\u0027re settled here.\" He looked around the kitchen. \"Could you and Nicodemus manage another baking this afternoon? Not a full one, a half, so that there will be small breads only.\" \"Probably,\" said Patricius. \"Since there is no convivium this evening.\" He did not add any such obvious word as fortunately or luckily, but his satisfaction at this arrangement was obvious in every aspect of his demeanor. \"Had the Bondama arranged for one, she would most likely cancel it, given the weather. No one would want to come out of the city during a tempest.\" Niklos pointed to the box in which Patricius kept his recipes. \"Mixed meats and root vegetables, I\u0027d think, and wine to give it body.\" \"With onions and garlic as well as turnips and carrots. A good basic soup,\" said Patricius, both satisfaction and regret in his demeanor. \"Not like the old days, when they stuffed ducks with larks\u0027 tongues and sweetbreads.\" \"That dish hasn\u0027t been made in two centuries,\" said Niklos, and pointed to the handled bowls stacked on the shelf across the room. \"Plan to serve the soup before everyone retires.\" \"A late supper?\" Patricius asked, startled at the suggestion. \"Yes. To help them all sleep a little more soundly on a hard night,\" Niklos ordered, and then said, \"The main cellar, or the wine cellar?\" \"The main cellar. Onions, apples, turnips, sacks of grain, boxes of honeycombs, and smoked meats. All the signs are for a late spring, and we\u0027ll need to know our reserves. We don\u0027t want to have to slaughter all the shoats and lambs.\" He nodded toward the main hearth, where three large geese turned on spits manned by a bored scullion, dripping sizzling grease onto the bricks. \"This will be ready for prandium, in less than an hour now.\" \"I hope you will have a pleasant meal,\" said Niklos, as good manners required. He nodded and started off toward the door that led to the main cellar. \"Is there an oil-lamp I can use?\" \"Just inside the door at the top of the stairs, on a hook; see you put it back,\" said Patricius, and began to make his way through the baskets of vegetables, selecting those that would go into the soup. The stairs zigzagged down into the cellar - three large, stone rooms filled with barrels and sacks and baskets of all manner of foodstuffs. The place was cool even at the height of summer; just now it was chilly. Sylvandrus Polli and Aristarchion were in the second room, the only one with a window, and they stood next to a sealed vat of olive oil. One that had been broached was slightly behind them. \"Major Domo,\" Niklos called out, \"the Bondama is closing the house for the storm, and is calling all the livestock in.\" \"There,\" said Polli. \"I told you she wouldn\u0027t take any chances.\" Aristarchion pulled at the edge of his short beard, now more than half white, and said, \"It is a good precaution.\" \"There will be soup and bread for a late supper. If the storm turns more dangerous, a good part of the household will be up during the night.\" Niklos regarded the two men. \"If you will be good enough to help arrange this?\" \"It is our duty,\" said Polli somberly. \"We have done about half the inventory down here, but under the circumstances, the rest can wait. We can postpone the rest until the storm passes.\" He took a piece of chalk and made a note on the vat in front of him. \"We can resume with this in a day or so.\" \"It is going to be a long night,\" Aristarchion said, folding up the scroll in his hands. \"How soon must we be ready to engage the storm?\" \"As soon as it starts,\" said Niklos, going toward the stairs, holding his oil-lamp up to help light the way for the other two. \"So my shadow won\u0027t block your lamplight.\" When they reached the kitchen, three more scullions and a pair of under-cooks were huddled with Patricius, discussing supper and the second night meal. \"This is all to the good,\" said Patricius as he caught sight of the major domo. \"We should have a pleasant night, storm or no storm.\" \"So long as there are no disruptions,\" said Patricius. As if to punctuate the cook\u0027s remark, there was a clanging from the main gate, and the sound of activity as a number of household slaves rushed to discover who had arrived. \"Is it raining yet?\" Aristarchion asked. \"The wind is rising.\" \"No rain, but it won\u0027t be long,\" said Patricius. \"Then it will be all to the good that we admit travelers now. Once the rain begins, there will be mud everywhere,\" said Orandus, the older under-cook. \"See that the vestibule is ready for visitors,\" said Polli. \"And have guest rooms made up.\" Niklos considered this, and added, \"As soon as we know who has arrived and how many are in the party, inform me so that I may tell Bondama Clemens how many travelers will be stopping here for the night.\" The wind was drubbing the house with heavy gusts, and more of the household staff came into the kitchen on the way to the dining room set aside for their use. The thick glass in the windows rattled and the shutters quivered against their iron braces. \"Pity the mariners at sea tonight,\" said Polli, whose nephews worked on merchant ships. \"True enough,\" said Niklos. \"But let us prepare to welcome the travelers.\" He started toward the front of the house. \"I leave you to tend to the evening meals.\" \"The baking is under way,\" said Patricius, paying very little attention to Niklos. \"The ovens are heating and the doughs are being kneaded. They\u0027ll be in the oven by nightfall.\" \"When do you want to present the travelers to Bondama Clemens?\" Polli called after Niklos. \"As soon as they are dried and warm,\" said Niklos, striding toward the main door of the house, listening to the roaring wind. He saw Sergius busily lighting more oil-lamps, and he paused long enough to say, \"If you will learn the names of the travelers, where they came from, and where they are bound?\" \"Of course. We will have no strangers in the Bondama\u0027s house.\" He had donned an abolla over his sleeved tunica, but he still looked cold. Niklos went out through the main door, making sure to cross the threshold on his right foot. The wind struck him like a weighted club, and he steadied himself against it. He saw the flickering oil- l amp in its glass cage beside the door and wondered if anyone would be able to see it when the rain began. He went out toward the main gate, standing open to admit the small party of merchants; all the while he listened to the boom of the wind. When he was near enough to be heard, he called out, \"Travelers! On behalf of Bondama Clemens, whose estate this is, you are welcome to shelter from the storm as her guests.\" There were three men riding mules, huddled into their byrri, their hoods pulled forward to protect their faces; they led seven mules, all well-laden. Their escort was five armed men mounted on horses. They, too, had heavy abollae to keep out the cutting wind. Four grooms had run up to help the men dismount and to lead their animals to the stable. The three slaves manning the gate were struggling to close it once again. One of the merchants got down from his mule and turned to Niklos. He steadied himself by holding on to the broad pommel of his saddle. \"Thank the Bondama for her hospitality,\" he said, his Latin heavily accented with Greek. \"I am Orestes of Naissus. We are bound for Ravenna and Roma. These are my companions, Fulvius Gaudiensis, and Marcellos Basilios.\" He indicated the other two merchants. \"I fear Fulvius has taken ill, and is in need of succor.\" For an instant, Niklos wished that Sanct\u0027 Germain were with them and not in the remote mountains of the old Province of Dacia. \"Certainly,\" he said. \"Kardens, see that the ailing man is taken to his room at once, and make sure that Mater Rhodanthe is sent to care for him.\" The slave who had finally secured the gate nodded. \"Yes, Bondsman,\" he said flatly, and went to the last mounted of the merchants, where he helped the ailing man out of the saddle, then offered him his shoulder to lean on. The escort had already dismounted and were leading their horses and the pack-mules toward the stable, following the groom with the enclosed oil-lamp. The day was dark now, with no trace of color in the clouds, but it was mid-afternoon. The remaining grooms took the riding mules in hand and went off after the others. Orestes of Naissus regarded Niklos narrowly. \"It is rare to find so ... so fine a reception on the roads these days.\" He walked unsteadily, as if his back were sore. \"Bondama Clemens keeps to the Roman traditions,\" said Niklos, indicating that the two merchants should accompany him. \"We will have rooms for you, and a simple meal in a short while, but no convivium.\" \"On such short notice, no one would expect otherwise. And I fear Marcellos Basilios and I are tired and would be poor company.\" He turned to Basilios and said, \"I trust you are willing to have simple fare tonight.\" \"After what we have endured on the road, simple fare is splendid; some meat, some wine, and a bread and I will think myself blessed,\" Basilios answered. Niklos was almost at the main door when he thought of something more to ask. \"Have you any news of the Huns?\" Orestes moaned, \"They kept winter at the foot of the mountains. Odessus and Tomi are thoroughly in their hands, where the cities are not in ruins. The Huns have spent their time improving their weapons and learning more about Roman defenses. They were boasting that by next winter they will control the Carpathians down to the Danuvius.\" He crossed the threshold on the right foot and made sure Basilios did the same. Sergius made a sign of approval, and held out his hand for their byrri, saying, \"There are laenae laid out for you in your rooms.\" \"Do you think they will succeed?\" Niklos pursued, for once paying no heed to the courtesy the men had been given. \"The Huns? coming so far south?\" Orestes nodded. \"I would wager on it,\" he said grimly. \"They are not inclined to idle bragging.\" Sylvandrus Polli came up to the newcomers. \"Be welcome in the house of Bondama Clemens,\" he said. \"Your companion is being treated by Mater Rhodanthe, who will tell you of his condition later. If you will come with me, I will show you to your rooms. Your personal cases are being brought in from the stable. Will you need a servant to help you, or would you prefer to manage on your own?\" The merchants exchanged glances, then Basilios said, \"If you could spare one to wait upon two of us?\" \"Of course,\" said Polli. \"This way,\" and he started off under the overhang of the atrium, leaving Niklos to go to Olivia. She was seated at her writing table, a tree of oil-lamps providing illumination for the reports Niklos had given her earlier. \"What have you learned?\" she asked when he had explained the basics. \"They\u0027re worried about the Huns, that was conspicuous, and not just in words, but the whole of their expression: more worried than they are about Roman tax collectors.\" He paused, then added, \"Orestes said that they have their sights on the Carpathians.\" As he said that, the first rush of rain washed down over the hillside, sounding like a continuous load of pebbles had been dropped across the land. Olivia looked up at the ceiling and a shiver of discomfort went through her, but she spoke calmly enough. \"I have been thinking that I should send you to Sanct\u0027 Germain with my next letter to him, as soon as the storm is over. You can see for yourself how he is faring, and you may add your voice to mine if you think he would be wiser to leave the mountains than to stay.\" \"And what of you? Do you intend to come with me?\" \"No, much as I would like to do it. If you think Aquileia isn\u0027t safe, the roads north are much less so, and not only because of the Huns.\" She smiled without amusement. \"Don\u0027t fret, Niklos. The household here will guard me well enough, though I will miss you while you are away.\" She smiled, and there was something profound in her eyes, an acknowledgment that she could finally be of use to Sanct\u0027 Germain, who had done so much for her. \"If you have to be gone until winter, so be it, so long as you find him and determine he is safe.\" \"Rogerian is with him. Why should he need me?\" Niklos asked. \"Rogerian has only recently left Constantinople, and he won\u0027t have reached the Carpathians yet; for all we know, the Huns have caught him,\" said Olivia with the kind of tranquil determination that Niklos knew it would be useless to dispute. \"All right. But speak to the merchants this evening, before you decide to send me off.\" She considered. \"Very well. But if I tell you that it must be done, I expect you to comply without complaint.\" Niklos sighed. \"As you wish, Olivia,\" he said, and began to plan what he would have to take with him on the coming journey. Text of an arrest warrant for the detention of Rugierus of Gades, issued by the Imperial Secretary, Herakles Akacios, in Constantinople, copied with fixed ink on vellum and dispatched by Imperial couriers to nine cities in Thracia and Moesia. To the Imperial Governors, the Praetori Custodii, Governors, regional guadians, the garrison Tribunes, and the Proconsuls of the Emperor, this notification of detention from the Imperial Secretary, Herakles Akacios, at the pleasure of the Emperor Theodosios. Be it known that the servant of Dom Feranescus Rakoczy Sanctu-Germainios, one Rugierus of Gades, currently believed to be traveling alone toward the Danuvius River, is to be apprehended and returned to Constantinople to explain to the Imperial Questor certain matters put before the Imperial Questor by the factor Artemidorus Iocopolis, at the exemplary instigation of Patras Metho- dos, who has declared he is convinced that this Rugierus of Gades is part of an organization of smugglers who may or may not be allied with Rugierus of Gades\u0027 employer, the Dom Feranescus Rakoczy Sanctu-Germainios. In order to determine the truth of this allegation, Rugierus of Gades must be held and returned to Constantinople. Failure to comply with this order will serve as an indication that the official refusing to carry out this order is no longer loyal to the Emperor Theodosios and the Roman Empire in the East. Those who are willing to pursue this matter will be brought to the favorable attention of the Emperor, and will, in due time, be rewarded for that loyalty. Those who shirk this duty will be known as officials of tergiversation and no longer worthy of the trust bestowed upon them by the Emperor.
