{"id":107187,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Thunder had growled in the low-hanging clouds for most of the morning; the air was hot, close, and humid, making for bad tempers and lethargy among the residents of Sanctu-Eustachios the Hermit monastery. The refugees went slowly about their chores, although a few of them hardly bothered with their assigned tasks, but stayed under the trees, dawdling over the morning beer; when monks patrolling the grounds admonished them for sloth, many of them compounded their sins by cursing. Soldiers manning the battlements no longer looked for Huns approaching, but for fires ignited by lightning, or the tatters in the cloud that promised the relief of rain. The largest company of monks kept to their scheduled rituals, praying for rain along with other blessings.\\n\\n Mangueinic had come to the old chapel when the morning was half-gone; he had turned surly, claiming his severed leg was aching where the foot had been; his patience was wearing away and he was damp with sweat. He stared at Sanctu-Germainios, daring him to provide relief. \"I can\u0027t bear it,\" he said loudly. \"I can\u0027t sleep. My whole leg is sore, even the part that\u0027s gone. My good leg is swollen, so are my hands, and my calceus doesn\u0027t fit.\"\\n\\n \"I have something that may be anodyne,\" said Sanctu-Germainios . He went to his red-lacquer chest and took out a jar of greenish pellets. \"These are powdered willow-bark, juniper berries, and hawthorn berries mixed with a paste of parsley and ground celery seed. If you take three of them now, and three when you go to bed, you should be less uncomfortable, and your hands and feet less swollen. I can also give you a salve for your scars.\"\\n\\n The leader of the Watchmen held out his hand and counted aloud as Sanctu-Germainios measured them onto his palm. \"That bondsman - the one who came last week from Aquileia to seek you out? - he\u0027s making himself useful in the stable. He\u0027s a better farrier than Monachos Cleander. He\u0027s trimmed all the horses\u0027 hooves and all the mules\u0027. He\u0027s got a way with the foals, as well. They\u0027re behaving much better since he took them in hand.\"\\n\\n \"It was his calling, training horses, before he became bondsman to my ... kinswoman,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, recalling his first meeting with Niklos more than a century ago, when he was teaching Olivia to ride as well as drive; his death and restoration to life had provided Olivia with the devoted male companion she required, someone who was increasingly necessary for women in the Eastern and Western Roman Empire. In the decades since his return to life, Niklos had proved to be her loyal friend as well as her defender. \"Since he came to her service, he has broadened his skills.\"\\n\\n \"Well, whatever accounts for it, he\u0027s a capable fellow, and we have need of him. I\u0027m pleased he came. I didn\u0027t think I would be, at first, but I see he has his uses.\" He looked at the pellets in his hand. \"Three now and three when I go to bed.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. If you want more, come to me tomorrow,\" said Sanctu-Germainios .\\n\\n He picked three pellets and dropped them into his mouth, biting down on them and then swallowing hard; his face squnched at the taste. \"Can I take them with my beer? They\u0027re pretty bitter.\"\\n\\n \"As you like,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"Or eat them with an apple. That should sweeten them.\"\\n\\n \"An apple will do,\" said Mangueinic. \"How long before this eases? It\u0027s wearing me out, the hurt and the heat together.\"\\n\\n \"Once the rain comes, you will be better,\" Sanctu-Germainios promised. \"When the air is moist and hot, no one is entirely - \"\\n\\n \"I mean, how long before I feel more ... comfortable?\"\\n\\n \"You should notice some improvement before the cooks serve prandium, sooner if the weather breaks,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, wondering again where Nicoris had gone. With the weather turning ugly, his concern for her was increasing; he knew how bad weather discomfited her.\\n\\n \"Good enough.\" Mangueinic made a positive sign with his hands, then sighed as if under the weight of a heavy burden. \"If only it would rain, and rain hard and long. Then the chance of fires would go down, and the air won\u0027t be so oppressive. A good heavy thunderstorm would help us all.\"\\n\\n \"Then let us hope for the storm to come soon,\" said Sanctu-Germainios , handing Mangueinic his crutch, noticing the slight hesitation before he took it.\\n\\n More thunder bludgeoned the clouds; outside someone screamed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d best go and find out what that\u0027s about,\" said Mangueinic, hitching himself toward the main door. \"Thank you for these pellets. I hope they work.\"\\n\\n \"You will know by mid-day,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, watching Mangueinic depart. Once the door was closed, he went to his chest once again and inspected the jars, bottles, pots, and vials that remained, shaking his head. Olivia\u0027s provisions had been most helpful, but even they would not last through the end of summer. Another, louder cry demanded his attention.\\n\\n \"Smoke! There\u0027s a fire!\"\\n\\n A second voice cut in, barking out, \"It\u0027s three ridges away, to the east, you fool! The wind is out of the west! It\u0027ll move away from us!\"\\n\\n \"The lightning did it!\" cried another, from some little distance away.\\n\\n \"Lightning? The Huns, more likely,\" shouted someone near the old chapel.\\n\\n There was an eruption of questions, hollers, and shrieks, the cacophony almost loud enough to rival the next mutter of thunder.\\n\\n Sanctu-Germainios went toward the door, his curiosity and his growing apprehension for Nicoris getting the better of him. As he stepped out of the old chapel, he saw the level of confusion had increased sharply, with men and women milling about, wringing their hands, glowering at their comrades, or cursing the heavens. A dozen monks were making their way through the churning refugees, ineffectively admonishing those they could get to listen to pray, to entrust their souls to God, to calm their distress. He doubted these pious exhortations would do much good, but he listened to them long enough to realize that more order was needed, for the disruption was spreading, increasing with the band of smoke to the east. Wading into the pandemonium, he sought out Mangueinic, raising his voice to be heard. \"You and Neves and Bernardius need to join with the monks to restore order. Look at how the residents are behaving, and it is not simply the thunder that causes them to fret. There will be fighting soon if the refugees are allowed to go on this way.\"\\n\\n Mangueinic thought this over for several heartbeats, then said, \"You\u0027re right, Dom. I\u0027ll find Bernardius. You get Neves and we\u0027ll meet at the monks\u0027 church, where Priam Corydon is. We\u0027ll accost him as soon as he\u0027s done with Mass.\"\\n\\n \"Very good,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, threading his way toward the dormitory assigned to the mercenaries that had the armory attached to it. He found Neves in the armory busy with three of his men in sharpening swords and spear-points on the three turning stone wheels set up for that purpose. Critical gazes turned toward him, watching him for any sign of treachery.\\n\\n \"Dom,\" Neves greeted him with a show of bonhomie, \"the rabbits are scampering, aren\u0027t they? Imagine being spooked by a little thunder. Or by a foreigner.\" This last was pointedly directed at his men.\\n\\n \"If you mean that the refugees are agitated, you have the right of it, and their fright is increasing,\" said Sanctu-Germainios. \"That is why I would like you to accompany me to the monks\u0027 church, so that we may forestall the kind of disruption we\u0027ve dealt with before, but on a grander scale.\" He saw the three lieutenants exchange a sardonic glance. \"Order must be restored or there will be trouble for all of us.\" He could see that his warning caught Neves\u0027 attention. \"The people are afraid, and frightened people are - \"\\n\\n \"Skittish and volatile, as we see,\" Neves finished for him. \"You\u0027re right.\" He stopped working the foot-pedal and set aside his Byzantine sword, then wiped his hand across his brow, leaving a grimy smear behind. He rose from the stool on which he had been sitting and said to his lieutenants, \"I\u0027ll be back in a little while, with some kind of plan, I trust. In the meantime, Linus, find Luitpald and go out to the men and tell them to keep to their posts unless some danger threatens us from outside the walls, in which case, sound the alarm.\" He wiped his fingers with a worn cloth, then said to Sanctu-Germainios, \"Let\u0027s be off.\"\\n\\n They kept to the edges of the increasing chaos, passing the dormitories and the small warehouse before they reached the church, where they found Mangueinic and Rotlandus Bernardius waiting for them.\\n\\n \"The Priam is still saying Mass,\" Mangueinic announced. \"He\u0027ll finish up shortly.\" As if to confirm this, the droning chant of the liturgy grew louder at the Blessings and Honor, enumerating the various Saints, Martyrs, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Priams, Patrases, Emperors, and Empresses whom the Church singled out for this ritual attention. \"Nothing more now than the Have Mercy on us and Go in the Peace of God.\"\\n\\n The others nodded; Neves said, \"They\u0027re going to need the Peace of God if this keeps up.\" He angled his chin toward the churning tide of people.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to see it rain, rain hard enough to put out any flames in the trees,\" said Bernardius. \"Carpi diem,\" he said, then looked around to see if any of the monks had overheard him, for they disliked hearing even his mangled Latin spoken since their rites were Greek.\\n\\n The next crack of thunder was louder, shuddering along the mountain as if to break the very stones asunder. For a long instant, there was complete silence from all the residents of the monastery while the peals rolled over them.\\n\\n \"That struck to the west of us, about half a league away, by the look of it,\" Sanctu-Germainios said as screams and shouts were renewed, and the monks in the church continued the Have Mercy on us with far more fervor than usual.\\n\\n \"Any sign of fire?\" Neves asked of no one in particular. \"Other than the one to the east of us?\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that bad enough?\" Mangueinic asked; he expected no answer and got none; he peered westward. \"No sign of smoke.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" said Neves.\\n\\n The four men waited, but no cries from the gate-tower sounded the alarm. Their postures slowly relaxed.\\n\\n \"Fire to the west could be a problem,\" said Neves.\\n\\n More thunder battered overhead, accompanied by shouts and shrieks.\\n\\n \"Or to the south; the wind sometimes swings around to the south in the evening,\" Mangueinic remarked. \"A pity we hadn\u0027t time enough or men enough to build in stone, as the monks did when they made their monastery.\"\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t know when the Huns would be upon us,\" Bernardius said. \"Semper pre - \" He broke off as lightning flickered through the clouds, pursued by thunder.\\n\\n \"Nor do we know now,\" Neves added when the noise abated.\\n\\n Before the two could begin an argument, the door of the church opened and one hundred thirty-eight monks, led by Priam Cory- don, filed out by twos, their heads bowed, their pace stately. They paused to turn and make the sign of the cross to the door of the church before it was closed by two novices. The monks were about to continue on to their cells when they caught sight of the four men waiting. Priam Corydon halted his monks and made the sign of the fish. \"What has happened?\"\\n\\n \"There is trouble among the refugees,\" said Neves.\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s getting worse,\" said Mangueinic.\\n\\n \"Fourteen of my monks were sent to calm them,\" said Priam Corydon. \"The rest are at their duties in the monastery.\" He frowned, thinking of the forty-six monks who had left Sanctu-Eustachios the Hermit since the arrival of the refugees. \"What do you require of us now?\"\\n\\n \"Well, your monks didn\u0027t succeed in calming the residents,\" said Neves.\\n\\n \"They - the refugees, not the monks - should probably be confined to their dormitories until the rain has passed, and the air is cooler,\" Bernardius recommended. \"You know, limit the chance for disturbances.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that would help? They might still fight among themselves,\" said Mangueinic.\\n\\n \"Double the Watchmen on the towers,\" Bernardius suggested. \"That way, if there is any trouble beyond our walls, we\u0027ll know it at once.\"\\n\\n Priam Corydon held up his hand, his features set into lines of resignation. \"Not here. Bernardius, Neves, Mangueinic, come along to my office. Sanctu-Germainios, it would probably be best if you remained in the old chapel. If there is trouble, you\u0027ll be needed there more than with us.\"\\n\\n \"As you wish,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, and stepped back from the church. \"If you would like my observations as regional guardian - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll send a novice for you when we\u0027re ready,\" Priam Corydon declared, and motioned the men and monks to follow him, Neves, Bernardius, and Mangueinic bringing up the rear.\\n\\n Sanctu-Germainios watched them go, attended by a low grumble of thunder, then took himself back to the old chapel. He understood Priam Corydon\u0027s preference for the company of Mangueinic, Neves, and Bernardius: those three commanded men with weapons, and he did not. Making his way down the gradual slope toward the old chapel, he could see that the refugees were still discomposed, balking at every sound from the clouds, lamenting at every bolt of lightning they could discern. As he went into the old chapel, he was startled and relieved to discover Nicoris standing at the small table near the rear wall, a sack lying open in front of her, out of which she was sorting herbs.\\n\\n \"Oh, Dom,\" she called as she caught sight of him. \"Look what I found down the hunters\u0027 trail: monkshood.\" She held up the plant for his inspection. \"You can make the syrup to treat Hluthaw\u0027s cough.\"\\n\\n Her pleasure had a brittle edge to it, and she continually looked about as if she expected the old chapel to be struck by lightning.\\n\\n Sanctu-Germainios nodded his approval. \"Excellent. But take care to wash your hands after you touch it. The virtue of the plant is very strong, and can harm those who do not need it. You shouldn\u0027t handle it more than necessary.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not all I found.\" She laughed, her tone a bit too shrill. \"There\u0027s water-lettuce from the stream. And nettles, hawthorn, tansy, and purge-root. I saw bear tracks around a large thicket of berry- vines, so I didn\u0027t stay to pick any.\" She held out a slightly wilted plant with yellow flowers. \"Primrose. You said you can make a healing salve from primrose.\"\\n\\n \"Most impressive; I will turn it to good use,\" he remarked, coming to her side to see what else she had brought. \"Mountain thyme. Pennyroyal.\" He sniffed the delicate leaves. \"Angelica-root. Feverfew. You\u0027ve been very diligent.\"\\n\\n She flushed. \"Thank you for saying so.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no reason for thanks,\" he said, and saw a flash in her quicksilver eyes and a firmer set to her jaw. \"You have no reason to be offended, Nicoris.\"\\n\\n \"You remind me that I\u0027m beneath you. I know that. I can\u0027t forget it, Dom.\" She put heavy emphasis on his title, and glanced up at the barrel-dome, then back at him.\\n\\n He met her glare with kindness in his eyes. \"I meant only that it is I who should be thanking you.\"\\n\\n It took her a short while to speak up again. \"You are a perplexing man, Dom. As much as you are a man at all.\"\\n\\n \"Accepted,\" he said, knowing she wanted to wound him as she had felt herself to be wounded.\\n\\n This time the percussion from the clouds rattled all the buildings of the monastery, followed by wails of dread.\\n\\n Nicoris reached for him and hung on while the thunder rolled away in echoes. \"I hate that sound. I hate it,\" she whispered, her face pressed against his shoulder.\\n\\n \"It will pass. The rain will come and the thunder will stop,\" he reassured her, his arms lightly around her. \"The heat makes it worse.\"\\n\\n \"God is displeased,\" Nicoris exclaimed.\\n\\n \"That seems unlikely, or we must suppose that God is displeased every summer,\" he told her gently. \"The seasons have temperaments of their own, and I doubt that any god bothers with them very often.\"\\n\\n \"There is only one God,\" she said, pulling away from him, becoming more discomposed. \"All others are false.\" She looked around as if she were afraid of being overheard.\\n\\n \"All worshippers say that, of all gods but their own.\"\\n\\n Her eyes widened. \"Think where you are, Dom,\" she admonished him. \"To speak heresy, and with the thunder treading through the heavens ...\"\\n\\n This time the lightning and the thunder came at once, leaving a sharp odor in the air, and more lamentations. Then the skies let loose their bounty, not as rain but as hail. It rattled on the roof and walls of the old chapel, it ricocheted off the ground and buzzed on the roofs of all the buildings of the monastery; screeching and howls were quickly drowned out by the steady seething of the hail.\\n\\n Nicoris yelped and flung herself once again into the haven of Sanctu-Germainios\u0027 arms. \"Lord of the Heavens, have mercy on me.\" In a kind of desperation, she kissed him, her mouth hard on his while the hail bounced and thrummed.\\n\\n The kiss was a long one, imbued with as much terror as desire; Sanctu-Germainios could feel her need rising, and he felt memories stir, memories that were as unwelcome as they were intense, of long days and nights enclosed in darkness, a darkness that was only alleviated by the monthly offering of a victim to his hunger. Feeding on repulsion and terrified loathing, his loneliness had grown through the decades until all traces of sympathy had drained out of him and he dreaded the burden of companionship even more than he yearned for it. Her fear recalled those years to him, and the wretched desolation that had overcome him; the memory sickened him and he strove to break their embrace without giving her more distress. Finally he ended the poignant, appalling kiss, stroking her hair as he moved a step back from her. \"Not this way, Nicoris. Please. Not this way.\"\\n\\n She stared at him wildly, her face working. \"I\u0027m so scared,\" she hissed. \"The storm is - \"\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said.\\n\\n Thunder banged like a closing door, and the hail got louder, and then rapidly slacked off to a murmur.\\n\\n She shrieked and covered her ears. \"Make it stop!\"\\n\\n \"You know no one can do that,\" he said. \"If it were possible, I would.\"\\n\\n \"It is God\u0027s footsteps. He reminds us that He knows everything.\" She made the sign of the fish. \"He tells us of our sins.\"\\n\\n \"Lightning ignites the air, and the thunder is the sound of it.\" He had heard that theory seven centuries before, and over time he had come to believe it was the most accurate of all the hypotheses regarding lightning that he had encountered.\\n\\n Nicoris shook her head. \"God knows all; He warns us of His displeasure at our sins. The monks say so. The monks listen, and they hear the warning God sends, and they bow to His Will.\" She bit her lower lip. \"Sometimes I think they know when I lie; God whispers to them, and they heed Him. You know when I do; I can feel it,\" she said, slowly pacing toward the main door, not looking back at him. \"You say it doesn\u0027t matter, that you accept it as part of me, but it does; it matters.\"\\n\\n \"Then why do you lie?\" he asked, wondering if she would finally tell him the truth, whatever that truth might be.\\n\\n \"Because they\u0027d kill me if they knew.\" She turned and came back toward him, her gaze fixed on the floor. \"You might not, but...\"\\n\\n \"I will not kill you if you tell me the truth: my Word on it.\" He regarded her steadily, adding, \"And I will keep your secret.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"No. No, you won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\" She looked at him for a searing instant, then turned away.\\n\\n He went to her but did not touch her. \"Shall I tell you what I think your secret is? Would that make it easier for you?\"\\n\\n Although she nodded, she said, \"No. You can\u0027t know. You\u0027d despise me if you knew. You\u0027d betray me.\"\\n\\n \"I would not,\" he said, his voice low and solacing; as he spoke, he sensed his protests were fruitless.\\n\\n A distant mumble of thunder marked the end of the hail and the start of the rain.\\n\\n \"Is it over?\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"The rain should go on for some time,\" he said, and lightly brushed her upper arm with his fingers.\\n\\n She flinched as if she had been scalded. \"Don\u0027t! Don\u0027t treat me well when you know I\u0027m not worthy of it. If I told you - \" Then she studied his face, her curiosity mixed with contempt. \"Why don\u0027t you force me to tell you? No one would blame you, not even I would.\"\\n\\n \"When has force ever gained truth?\" he asked her, compassion in his dark eyes. \"You would tell me what I want to hear, not the truth.\" He had a brief, troubling memory of Srau. An ineluctable sadness came over him, and he regarded Nicoris heedfully. \"When you decide to tell me, I will be honored to listen.\" He could not tell her that he knew because he had tasted her blood, knowing how much such a revelation would distress her.\\n\\n \"Why? Because you take your pleasure with me?\"\\n\\n \"No: because I love you, and the pleasure I receive is yours to give.\" His compelling gaze rested upon her.\\n\\n \"You love what I provide you,\" she countered, unnerved by his serene demeanor.\\n\\n \"Yes: because it is the essence of you.\"\\n\\n She began to weep, making almost no sound, her hands shading her eyes as if to block the sight of her tears from him.\\n\\n \"Nicoris - \"\\n\\n \"Promise me,\" she said as she cut him off. \"Promise me you won\u0027t tell anyone about this.\"\\n\\n \"That you have a secret? I will not.\"\\n\\n She whispered, \"I wish I could believe you.\"\\n\\n He held out his hands to her. \"So do I.\" He waited, and when she remained still, he added, \"You know my secret, and you have kept it.\"\\n\\n Slowly she put her hands into his. \"Dom, why do you endure my insults?\"\\n\\n \"Because I hope to keep your good opinion,\" he said, and realized Nicoris would be puzzled by this explanation, and so added, \"To retain your respect.\"\\n\\n \"You can command my respect,\" she said.\\n\\n \"If I must command it, it is not respect but concession.\" He slowly enfolded her in his arms, remaining silent while she cried.\\n\\n When her tears had given way to sniffs and hiccups, she finally looked up at him. \"I wish we could leave this place.\"\\n\\n \"So do I,\" he said. \"But until we know that we may travel without risk of being attacked, it is safer to remain behind the double walls here.\"\\n\\n She sighed. \"Do you think you could go with the soldiers? If Neves and his company left, couldn\u0027t we go with them? Wouldn\u0027t we be safe?\"\\n\\n \"Possibly,\" said Sanctu-Germainios, cradling her close to him. \"But they will not be departing until the crops are in, at the earliest.\" And when, he added to himself, the risk of raids would be at its height.\\n\\n Nicoris thought about this for a brief time. \"All right,\" she said, \"but must we stay here for another winter?\"\\n\\n \"I ... ,\" He faltered. \"I hope it will not be necessary.\"\\n\\n The wind was picking up and the rain swept the mountains in angled waves; inside the old chapel it sounded as if the storm were breathing.\\n\\n \"It is God, making His Presence known.\" She twisted in his arms, listening to the susurrus of the rain. \"The monks are right about that.\"\\n\\n \"It is the nature of wind and rain,\" he said.\\n\\n \"How can you be sure?\" She shivered from fright.\\n\\n Instead of renewing the debate, he kissed her forehead. \"It will pass, Nicoris, and if it rains long enough, the fire to the east will be put out. If the wind lessens, we will have a fine day tomorrow.\"\\n\\n She relaxed a little, her body no longer bow-string taut. \"It would be a fine thing to have the fire die.\"\\n\\n \"The wind has shifted to the north, which will also serve us well.\" He turned her face to his. \"Let me give you a tincture to help you to rest. By the time you waken, the storm should have lessened and we will have time together.\"\\n\\n \"Will I have dreams?\" Her apprehension was less apparent than it had been while the thunder was beating the mountains, but it had not faded entirely.\\n\\n \"You may,\" he said gently.\\n\\n \"Can you make sure I won\u0027t dream?\" she pleaded.\\n\\n He considered. \"I can make it so you probably will not dream.\" She thought about this, then she nodded. \"All right. I will take your potion.\" She moved out of his arms. \"And tonight I\u0027ll welcome you to my bed.\"\\n\\n \"If that is what you want,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It is. It will be,\" she said with conviction.\\n\\n He started toward the red-lacquer chest. \"Then it is what you shall have,\" he said.\\n\\n As she watched him, she said suddenly, \"You could give me poison, couldn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I could, but I will not,\" he said, turning toward her.\\n\\n \"How can I be sure?\" She trembled, but held his eyes with her own.\\n\\n Certain now that she felt threatened by more than the thunder and lightning, he opened the chest and took out a chalcedony cup, his curiosity about her apprehension quelled for the moment. Selecting his ingredients, he said, lightly and painfully, \"I suppose you will have to trust me.\"\\n\\n Text of a letter from Verus Flautens, Praetor-General of Drobetae in the former Province of Dacia, to Gnaccus Tortulla, Praetor Cus- todis of Viminacium in the Province of Moesia, written in Greek code on sanded linen and carried by Flautens\u0027 personal courier and delivered twenty-two days after it was written.\\n\\n To the most esteemed Praetor Custodis of Viminacium in the Province of Moesia, the Praetor-General of Drobetae in the former Province of Dacia, on this, the last day of July in the Christian year 439, Ave!\\n\\n My colleague and friend, I fear I must once again beseech you to send us troops to guard and to provide escort for the many refugees who are flooding into Drobetae from the north. We have no place to shelter them, and still they continue to come. We have had to house them in all manner of places, from the halls of the basilica to the stables of the inns. There are many among these refugees in need of more care than we can provide, and I despair of their safety if at any time the town should be attacked.\\n\\n Our supplies of food are also growing crucially low, and with the Huns raiding through the mountains, no one can tell what crops they may actually be able to reap, so it is essential that we have food brought to us, or that places south of the Danuvius agree to take in as many of these refugees as they can. Otherwise we may be facing starvation among many of those who have come to us for safety.\\n\\n Some several days ago, a Hunnic scout was taken by one of my mounted patrols. He was brought to Drobetae to be questioned, but killed himself before anyone could question him. I find it worrying that he was only four leagues from the town when he was captured, and I have doubled my patrols to search out any others that may be lurking in the hills.\\n\\n Patras Fortunatos has warned that the churches can no longer provide the charity they are commanded to do, and will have to close their doors to those seeking the succor of the churches. Other priests have said much the same, although a number of mendicant monks have offered to seek out the sick and do what they can for them.\\n\\n That is another concern I have: that in such close conditions, fever could arise suddenly and spread before we would be able to isolate those who bear the disease, thus making it certain that more of the people in the town, as well as the refugees, would take illness. I have no means of treating such an outbreak, but with the summer in full heat and the people worn and tired, I cannot believe that such a terrible outcome may be completely avoided.\\n\\n Whatever you have that you may spare to help us would be appreciated beyond anything you can imagine. I pray you will do all that you can to relieve some part of the misery that has come to Drobetae.\\n\\n Verus Flautens\\n\\n Praetor-General of Drobetae\\n\\n the former Province of Dacia \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/burning-shadows-saint-germain-23/page-18.html","bookId":2505,"book":{"id":2505,"title":"Burning Shadows (Saint-Germain #23)","description":"Storyline: Burning Shadows (Saint-Germain #23) \\n In Burning Shadows, Yarbro looks at the legendary Huns from the perspective of the people who faced the brunt of their attacks.
