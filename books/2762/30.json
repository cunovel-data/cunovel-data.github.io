And he looks down at me in surprise.\n “Why is that?”\n “Because I’ve got my very own American Cowboy.”\n He smiles and shakes his head. “I’ve told you. You don’t have to keep calling me that. Awesome One will do.”\n I roll my eyes.\n But he is awesome. I’m just never going to admit that to him. He’s cocky enough as it is… but that’s just the way I like him.\n The sun beats down on our shoulders as we walk down to a pier. The sea laps softly at the wood and I stare down at the clear water.\n I tell him again the mechanics of swimming.\n And he nods.\n “Got it,” he tells me. “Keep my head up, relax and float. I can do it.”\n I nod. “Yes, you can. And I’ll be right there with you.”\n He laughs. “I think we’ve established this, Mi. You can’t save me. You’re half my size.”\n I roll my eyes.\n “I’ve saved you already,” I tell him. “I’ve saved you from an empty life without me in it.”\n I’m totally joking, of course, but he nods. He seems thoughtful.\n “Mia,” he says huskily, as he pulls me to him. “I was just wondering about something. Remember a couple of months ago…you said you were falling for me. Then you said you weren’t quite there. You were going to let me know when you were, but you’ve never said anything.”\n He pauses.\n And pauses.\n And looks at me with an eyebrow raised.\n I sigh happily. And smile.\n “I’m there,” I tell him. “I love you, Quinn McKeyen. I thought you already knew.”\n He grins and my knees weaken.\n “I do,” he admits. “I’ve known all along. I just wanted to hear you say it.”\n “I love you,” I tell him softly. Then I lean up on my tiptoes and whisper into his ear. “I love you. Forever and ever and ever.”\n He grins and grabs my hand.\n “Forever and ever and ever?” He raises an eyebrow now.\n I nod. “Yep. I told you—this is our own personal fairy tale.”\n He laughs and I squeeze his hand.\n “On three, okay?”\n He nods.\n We count to three.\n And then we jump.\n The End \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart/page-30.html","bookId":2762,"book":{"id":2762,"title":"Mia\u0027s Heart","description":"Storyline: \n Mia\u0027s Heart (The Paradise Diaries #2) \n My name is Mia Giannis. \n I am seventeen years old. \n I live in Valese, Caberra. \n This has become my mantra and my lifeline, having recently lost my memory due to a scary natural disaster. \n Yeah. I have amnesia. Messed up, right? \n You don\u0027t know the half of it. \n Not remembering anything has turned my world upside down. My parents try their hardest to “remind” me of who I was, but it doesn\u0027t feel right. Or, if what they\u0027re saying is true and that really was me, I\u0027m not sure I like that person very much. \n And then there’s my love life. Apparently, Gavin Ariastasis is my oldest and best friend in the world. Also, apparently, we’ve never dated. But now, noticing him for what feels like the first time, he’s making my heart do somersaults. He knows me inside and out—the real me. Plus, he’s sexy and charming as hell. Sounds perfect, right? \n But then... there’s the new guy. Quinn McKeyen – tall, gorgeous and deliciously American. His mischievous grin and slow Midwestern drawl turn my insides to mush in two seconds flat making me question who I really am and what I really want. \n Seriously. What am I supposed to do with all that?! I feel torn between them, but I barely even know who I am, let alone what I want. \n I just hope my indecisive heart will clue me in. And sooner rather than later…before I lose what little of my mind that I have left.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/mia-s-heart.jpg","author":"Courtney Cole","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/mia-s-heart.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:21 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:05:34 PM"}}
