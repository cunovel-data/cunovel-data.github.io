Several months ago, she had asked her mother what kind of clothes women wore in the Inkworld. “Which women?” Resa had inquired. “Farmers’ wives?\\n\\n Strolling players? Princes’ daughters? Maidservants?”\\n\\n “What did you wear?” Meggie asked, and Resa had gone into the nearest town with Darius and bought some dress material there: plain, coarsely woven red fabric. Then she had asked Elinor to bring the old sewing machine up from the cellar. “That’s the sort of dress I wore when I was living in Capricorn’s fortress as a maid,” her hands had said, putting the finished dress over Meggie’s head. “It would have been too fine for a peasant woman, but it was just about good enough for a rich man’s servant, and Mortola was very keen that we shouldn’t be much worse dressed than the prince’s maids – even if we only served a gang of fire-raisers.”\\n\\n Meggie stood in front of her wardrobe mirror and examined herself in the dull glass. She looked strange to herself. And she’d be a stranger in the Inkworld, too; a dress alone couldn’t alter that.\\n\\n A stranger, just as Dustfinger was here, she thought – and she remembered the unhappiness in his eyes. Nonsense, she told herself crossly, pushing back her smooth hair. I’m not planning to spend ten years there.\\n\\n The sleeves of the dress were already a little too short, and it was stretched tight over her breasts, too. “Good heavens, Meggie!” Elinor had exclaimed when she realized, for the first time, that they weren’t as flat as the cover of a book anymore. “Well, I imagine your Pippi Longstocking days are over now!”\\n\\n They hadn’t found anything suitable for Farid to wear, not in the attic or in the trunks of clothes down in the cellar that smelled of mothballs and cigar smoke, but he didn’t seem to mind. “Who cares? If it works we’ll start out in the forest,” he said. “No one will be interested in my jeans there, and as soon as we come to a village or town I’ll steal myself something to wear!”\\n\\n Everything always seemed so simple to him. He couldn’t understand that Meggie felt guilty because of Mo and Resa any more than he understood her anxiety to find the right clothes. When she confessed that she could hardly look Mo and her mother in the eye after deciding to go with him, he had just asked “Why?” looking at her blankly. “You’re thirteen! Surely they’d be marrying you off to someone quite soon anyway?” “Marrying me off?” Meggie had felt the blood rise to her face. But how could she talk about such things to a boy out of a story in the Thousand and One Nights, where all women were servants or slave girls – or lived in a harem? “Anyway,”\\n\\n added Farid, kindly ignoring the fact that she was still blushing, “you’re not intending to stay very long, are you?” No, she wasn’t. She wanted to taste and smell and feel the Inkworld, see fairies and princes – and then come home again to Mo and Resa, Elinor and Darius. There was just one problem: The words Orpheus had written might take her into Dustfinger’s story, but they couldn’t bring her back. Only one person could write her back again – Fenoglio, the inventor of the world she wanted to visit, the creator of glass men and blue-skinned fairies, of Dustfinger and Basta, too. Yes, only Fenoglio could help her to return. Every time Meggie thought of that, her courage drained away and she felt like canceling the whole plan, striking out those three little words she had added to what Orpheus had written: ” . . and the girl. ”\\n\\n Suppose she couldn’t find Fenoglio, suppose he wasn’t even in his own story anymore? Oh, come on! He must still be there, she told herself whenever that thought made her heart beat faster. He can’t simply write himself back, not without someone to read what he’s written aloud! But suppose Fenoglio had found another reader there, someone like Orpheus or Darius? The gift didn’t seem to be unique, as she and Mo had once thought.\\n\\n No, he’s still there! I’m sure he is! , thought Meggie for the hundredth time, reading her good-bye letter to Mo and Resa once more. She herself didn’t know why she had chosen to write it on the letterhead that she and Mo had designed together. That was hardly going to mollify him.\\n\\n Dearest Mo, dear Resa. Meggie knew the words by heart.\\n\\n Please don’t worry. Farid has to find Dustfinger to warn him about Basta, and I’m going, too. I won’t stay long, I just want to see the Wayless Wood, the Laughing Prince, and Cosimo the Fair, and perhaps the Black Prince and CloudDancer. I want to see the fairies again, and the glass men – and Fenoglio. He’ll write me back here. You know he can do it, so don’t worry. Capricorn isn’t in the Inkworld anymore, after all.\\n\\n See you soon, lots of love and kisses, Meggie.\\n\\n PS. I’ll bring you back a book, Mo. Apparently, there are wonderful books there, handwritten books full of pictures, like the ones in Elinor’s glass cases. Only even better. Please don’t be angry.\\n\\n She had torn up this letter and rewritten it three times, but that had made matters no better.\\n\\n Because she knew that there were no words that could stop Mo from being angry with her and Resa from weeping with anxiety – the way she did the day Meggie came home from school two hours later than usual. She put the letter on her pillow – they couldn’t miss seeing it there – and went over to the mirror again. Meggie, she thought, what are you doing? What do you think you’re doing? But her reflection did not reply.\\n\\n When she let Farid into her room just after midnight he was surprised to see her dress. “I don’t have shoes to go with it,” she said. “But luckily it’s quite long, and I don’t think my boots show much, do they?”\\n\\n Farid just nodded. “It looks lovely,” he murmured awkwardly. Meggie locked the door after letting him in, and took the key out of the lock so that it could be unlocked again from outside.\\n\\n Elinor had a second key, and though she probably wouldn’t be able to find it at first, Darius would know where it was. Meggie glanced at the letter on her pillow once more. .\\n\\n Over his shoulder, Farid had the backpack she had found in Elinor’s attic. “Oh, he’s welcome to it,” Elinor had said when Meggie asked her. “It once belonged to an uncle of mine. I hated him!\\n\\n The boy can put that smelly marten in it. I like the idea!” The marten! Meggie’s heart missed a beat.\\n\\n Farid didn’t know why Dustfinger had left Gwin behind, and Meggie hadn’t told him, although she knew the reason only too well. She herself, after all, had told Dustfinger what part the marten was to play in his story. He was to die a dreadful, violent death because of Gwin – if what Fenoglio had written came true. But Farid just shook his head sadly when she asked him about the marten. “He’s gone,” said the boy. “I tied him up in the garden, because the bookworm woman kept on at me about her birds, but he gnawed through the rope. I’ve looked for him everywhere, but I just can’t find him!” Clever Gwin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkspell-inkworld-2/page-21.html","bookId":2720,"book":{"id":2720,"title":"Inkspell (Inkworld #2)","description":"Storyline: The captivating sequel to INKHEART, the critically acclaimed, international bestseller by Cornelia Funke, an author who is emerging as a truly modern classic writer for children. \\n Although a year has passed, not a day goes by without Meggie thinking of INKHEART, the book whose characters became real.
