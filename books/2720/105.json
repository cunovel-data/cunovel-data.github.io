{"id":77980,"no":105,"title":"Page 105","content":"The surf shone in the moonlight, and the beach lay there deserted, except for a few footprints that no one, luckily, examined closely. The soldiers had brought horses for their prisoners.\n Meggie’s laid its ears back when one of the soldiers put her on its back. Only when it was trotting toward the mountains with her did she dare to look surreptitiously around. But there was no sign of Dustfinger and Farid. Except for the footprints in the sand.\n Chapter 57 – Fire and Water\n And what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?\n – Khalil Gibran, The Prophet\n All was quiet behind the walls of the infirmary when L. Dustfinger gestured to Farid to come out from among the trees. No weeping, no cursing the men who had come from the Castle of Night.\n Most of the women had gone back to the sick and dying. Only Roxane still stood on the beach, looking at the path the soldiers had taken.\n She went to Dustfinger, her footsteps weary.\n “I’ll go after them!” stammered Farid beside him, his fists clenched. “At least there’s no missing that accursed castle!”\n “What do you think you’re talking about, damn it?” Dustfinger snapped at him. “Do you believe you can just walk through the gates? That is the Castle of Night, where they stick chopped-off heads on the battlements.”\n Farid ducked his head and stared up at the silver towers. They rose to the sky as if to impale the stars.\n “But. . but Meggie,” he stammered.\n “Yes, all right, we’ll follow her,” said Dustfinger, irritation in his voice. “My leg’s already looking forward to the climb. But we’re not stumbling off just like that. You have something to learn yet.”\n The relief in the boy’s face when he looked at him – as if he were delighted at the prospect of creeping into the Adder’s nest!\n Dustfinger could only shake his head at such idiocy.\n “Something to learn? What?”\n “What I was going to show you anyway.” Dustfinger went toward the water. He wished his leg would hurry up and heal.\n Roxane followed him. “You two are going after them? What are you talking about?” Fear and rage were mingled on her face as she came between him and the boy. “You can’t go to the castle!\n There’s no more you can do! Either for the girl, or for the Barn Owl, or for any of the others. Your wonderful letter came to nothing, nothing at all!”\n “We’ll see,” was all Dustfinger would reply. “It depends whether Meggie read it out loud, and if so, how far she got.”\n He tried to move her aside, but Roxane pushed his hands away. “Let’s send a message to the Black Prince!” There was desperation in her voice. “Have you forgotten all the fire-raisers up there at the castle? You’ll be dead before the sun rises! What about Basta? What about Firefox and the Piper? Someone is bound to recognize your face!”\n “Who says I’m going to show my face?” he replied.\n Roxane flinched back. She cast Farid such a hostile glance that the boy turned away. “But that’s our secret. You’ve never shown anyone but me before. And you yourself said you’re the only one who can do it!”\n “The boy will be able to do it, too!”\n The sand crunched under his feet as he walked toward the waves. He did not stop until the surf was washing around his boots.\n “What’s she talking about?” asked Farid. “What are you going to show me? Is it very difficult?”\n Dustfinger looked around. Roxane was walking slowly back to the infirmary. She disappeared behind the plain wooden gate without once turning.\n “What is it?” Impatiently, Farid tugged at his sleeve. “Tell me.”\n Dustfinger turned his back to him. “Fire and water,” he said, “don’t really mix. You could say they’re incompatible. But when they do love each other, they love passionately.”\n It was a long time since he had last spoken the words he now whispered. But the fire understood. A flame licked up between the wet pebbles that the sea had washed up on the sand.\n Dustfinger bent and enticed it into the hollow of his hand as if it were a young bird, whispered, told it what he wanted, promised it a nocturnal game such as it had never played before . . and when it answered, crackling, flaring up, so hot that it burned his skin, he threw it into the foaming sea, fingers outstretched as if he still held the fire on invisible strings. The water snapped at the flame like a fish snapping at a fly, but the fire only burned brighter, while Dustfinger, standing on the shore, spread his arms wide.\n Hissing and flaring, the fire imitated him, moving to left and right along the sea wave, farther and farther, until the surf, now rimmed with flames, rolled toward the shore, and a band of fire was washed up at Dustfinger’s feet like a love token. He plunged both hands into the blazing foam, and when he straightened up again he held a fairy fluttering in his fingers, as blue as her forest sisters but surrounded by a fiery luster, and her eyes were as red as the flames from which she was born. Dustfinger held her in his hands like a rare moth, waited for the prickling of his skin, the heat running up his arms as if he suddenly had liquid fire instead of blood in his veins. Not until it had burned its way right up to his armpits did he let the tiny creature fly away, chattering and swearing crossly, as they always did when you lured them to you by making the sea play with fire.\n “What’s that?” asked Farid in alarm, looking at Dustfinger’s blackened hands and arms.\n Dustfinger took a cloth from his belt and carefully rubbed the soot into his skin. “That,” he said,\n “is something that will get us into the castle. But the soot works only if you get it from the fairies for yourself. So it’s your turn now.”\n Farid looked at him incredulously. “But I can’t do that!” he stammered. “I don’t know how you did it.”\n “Nonsense!” Dustfinger stepped back from the water and sat down on the damp sand. “Of course you can do it! Just think of Meggie!”\n Undecided, Farid looked up at the castle, while the waves licked his bare toes as if inviting him to play.\n “Won’t they see the fire up there?”\n “The castle is farther away than it looks. Believe me, your feet will show you that when we start climbing. And if the guards up there do see anything they’ll think it’s lightning, or fire-elves dancing over the water. When did you start thinking so hard before you began to play? All I can say is, if you wait much longer I shall certainly start remembering what a crazy notion going up there is.”\n That convinced Farid.\n The flame went out three times when he threw it into the breakers. But on the fourth attempt the waves were rimmed with fire for him as he had demanded – perhaps not quite such bright fire as they had made for Dustfinger, but the sea burned for Farid, too. And for the second time that night, fire and water played together.\n “Well done,” said Dustfinger, as the boy looked proudly at the soot on his arms. “Spread it well over your chest and legs and face.”\n “Why?” Farid looked at him, wide-eyed.\n “Because it will make us invisible,” replied Dustfinger, rubbing soot into his own face. “Until sunrise.”\n Chapter 58 – Invisible as the Wind\n “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake – I didn’t see you – of course I didn’t, you’re invisible – forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/inkspell-inkworld-2/page-105.html","bookId":2720,"book":{"id":2720,"title":"Inkspell (Inkworld #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The captivating sequel to INKHEART, the critically acclaimed, international bestseller by Cornelia Funke, an author who is emerging as a truly modern classic writer for children. \n Although a year has passed, not a day goes by without Meggie thinking of INKHEART, the book whose characters became real.
