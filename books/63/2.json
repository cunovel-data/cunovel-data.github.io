Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? \n [bbe] But you have put the poor man to shame. Are not the men of wealth rulers over you? do they not take you by force before their judges? \n 2:7 [hgb] 他 们 不 是 亵 渎 你 们 所 敬 奉 的 尊 名 吗 ？ （ 所 敬 奉 或 作 被 称 ） \n [kjv] Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? \n [bbe] Do they not say evil of the holy name which was given to you? \n 2:8 [hgb] 经 上 记 着 说 ， 要 爱 人 如 己 。 你 们 若 全 守 这 至 尊 的 律 法 才 是 好 的 。 \n [kjv] If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: \n [bbe] But if you keep the greatest law of all, as it is given in the holy Writings, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself, you do well: \n 2:9 [hgb] 但 你 们 若 按 外 貌 待 人 ， 便 是 犯 罪 ， 被 律 法 定 为 犯 法 的 。 \n [kjv] But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. \n [bbe] But if you take a man\u0027s position into account, you do evil, and are judged as evil-doers by the law. \n 2:10 [hgb] 因 为 凡 遵 守 全 律 法 的 ， 只 在 一 条 上 跌 倒 ， 他 就 是 犯 了 众 条 。 \n [kjv] For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. \n [bbe] For anyone who keeps all the law, but makes a slip in one point, is judged to have gone against it all. \n 2:11 [hgb] 原 来 那 说 不 可 奸 淫 的 ， 也 说 不 可 杀 人 。 你 就 是 不 奸 淫 ， 却 杀 人 ， 仍 是 成 了 犯 律 法 的 。 \n [kjv] For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. \n [bbe] For he who said, Do not be untrue in married life, is the same who said, Put no man to death. Now if you are not untrue in married life, but you put a man to death, the law is broken. \n 2:12 [hgb] 你 们 既 然 要 按 使 人 自 由 的 律 法 受 审 判 ， 就 该 照 这 律 法 说 话 行 事 。 \n [kjv] So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. \n [bbe] Let your words and your acts be those of men who are to be judged by the law which makes free. \n 2:13 [hgb] 因 为 那 不 怜 悯 人 的 ， 也 要 受 无 怜 悯 的 审 判 。 怜 悯 原 是 向 审 判 夸 胜 。 \n [kjv] For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment. \n [bbe] For the man who has had no mercy will be judged without mercy, but mercy takes pride in overcoming judging. \n 2:14 [hgb] 我 的 弟 兄 们 ， 若 有 人 说 ， 自 己 有 信 心 ， 却 没 有 行 为 ， 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ 这 信 心 能 救 他 吗 ？ \n [kjv] What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? \n [bbe] What use is it, my brothers, for a man to say that he has faith, if he does nothing? will such a faith give him salvation? \n 2:15 [hgb] 若 是 弟 兄 ， 或 是 姐 妹 ， 赤 身 露 体 ， 又 缺 了 日 用 的 饮 食 ， \n [kjv] If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, \n [bbe] If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of the day\u0027s food, \n 2:16 [hgb] 你 们 中 间 有 人 对 他 们 说 ， 平 平 安 安 地 去 吧 ， 愿 你 们 穿 得 暖 吃 得 饱 。 却 不 给 他 们 身 体 所 需 用 的 ， 这 有 什 么 益 处 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit? \n [bbe] And one of you says to them, Go in peace, be warm and full of food; but you do not give them the things of which their bodies have need, what profit is there in this? \n 2:17 [hgb] 这 样 信 心 若 没 有 行 为 就 是 死 的 。 \n [kjv] Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. \n [bbe] Even so faith without works is dead. \n 2:18 [hgb] 必 有 人 说 ， 你 有 信 心 ， 我 有 行 为 。 你 将 你 没 有 行 为 的 信 心 指 给 我 看 ， 我 便 借 着 我 的 行 为 ， 将 我 的 信 心 指 给 你 看 。 \n [kjv] Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. \n [bbe] But a man may say, You have faith and I have works; let me see your faith without your works, and I will make my faith clear to you by my works. \n 2:19 [hgb] 你 信 神 只 有 一 位 ， 你 信 的 不 错 。 鬼 魔 也 信 ， 却 是 战 惊 。 \n [kjv] Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. \n [bbe] You have the belief that God is one, and you do well: the evil spirits have the same belief, shaking with fear. \n 2:20 [hgb] 虚 浮 的 人 哪 ， 你 愿 意 知 道 没 有 行 为 的 信 心 是 死 的 吗 ？ \n [kjv] But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? \n [bbe] Do you not see, O foolish man, that faith without works is of no use? \n 2:21 [hgb] 我 们 的 祖 宗 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 把 他 儿 子 以 撒 献 在 坛 上 ， 岂 不 是 因 行 为 称 义 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? \n [bbe] Was not the righteousness of Abraham our father judged by his works, when he made an offering of Isaac his son on the altar? \n 2:22 [hgb] 可 见 信 心 是 与 他 的 行 为 并 行 ， 而 且 信 心 因 着 行 为 才 得 成 全 。 \n [kjv] Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? \n [bbe] You see that his faith was helping his works and was made complete by them; \n 2:23 [hgb] 这 就 应 验 经 上 所 说 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 信 神 ， 这 就 算 为 他 的 义 。 他 又 得 称 为 神 的 朋 友 。 \n [kjv] And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. \n [bbe] And the holy Writings were put into effect which said, And Abraham had faith in God and it was put to his account as righteousness; and he was named the friend of God. \n 2:24 [hgb] 这 样 看 来 ， 人 称 义 是 因 着 行 为 ， 不 是 单 因 着 信 。 \n [kjv] Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only. \n [bbe] You see that a man\u0027s righteousness is judged by his works and not by his faith only. \n 2:25 [hgb] 妓 女 喇 合 接 待 使 者 ， 又 放 他 们 从 别 的 路 上 出 去 ， 不 也 是 一 样 因 行 为 称 义 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way? \n [bbe] And in the same way, was not the righteousness of Rahab, the loose woman, judged by her works, when she took into her house those who were sent and let them go out by another way? \n 2:26 [hgb] 身 体 没 有 灵 魂 是 死 的 ， 信 心 没 有 行 为 也 是 死 的 。 \n [kjv] For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. \n [bbe] For as the body without the spirit is dead even so faith without works is dead. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/185/2346.html","bookId":63,"book":{"id":63,"title":"雅各书 James","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 神 和 主 耶 稣 基 督 仆 人 的 雅 各 ， 请 散 住 十 二 个 支 派 之 人 的 安 。 [kjv] James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/185","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:27 AM"}}
