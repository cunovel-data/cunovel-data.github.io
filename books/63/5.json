{"id":1873,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] ？ ？ ， 你 们 这 些 富 足 人 哪 ， 应 当 哭 泣 ， 号 啕 ， 因 为 将 有 苦 难 临 到 你 们 身 上 。 \n [kjv] Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. \n [bbe] Come now, you men of wealth, give yourselves to weeping and crying because of the bitter troubles which are coming to you. \n 5:2 [hgb] 你 们 的 财 物 坏 了 ， 衣 服 也 被 虫 子 咬 了 。 \n [kjv] Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. \n [bbe] Your wealth is unclean and insects have made holes in your clothing. \n 5:3 [hgb] 你 们 的 金 银 都 长 了 锈 。 那 锈 要 证 明 你 们 的 不 是 ， 又 要 吃 你 们 的 肉 ， 如 同 火 烧 。 你 们 在 这 末 世 ， 只 知 积 攒 钱 财 。 \n [kjv] Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. \n [bbe] Your gold and your silver are wasted and their waste will be a witness against you, burning into your flesh. You have put by your store in the last days. \n 5:4 [hgb] 工 人 给 你 们 收 割 庄 稼 ， 你 们 亏 欠 他 们 的 工 钱 。 这 工 钱 有 声 音 呼 叫 。 并 且 那 收 割 之 人 的 冤 声 ， 已 经 入 了 万 军 之 主 的 耳 了 。 \n [kjv] Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. \n [bbe] See, the money which you falsely kept back from the workers cutting the grass in your field, is crying out against you; and the cries of those who took in your grain have come to the ears of the Lord of armies. \n 5:5 [hgb] 你 们 在 世 上 享 美 福 ， 好 宴 乐 ， 当 宰 杀 的 日 子 竟 娇 养 你 们 的 心 。 \n [kjv] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. \n [bbe] You have been living delicately on earth and have taken your pleasure; you have made your hearts fat for a day of destruction. \n 5:6 [hgb] 你 们 定 了 义 人 的 罪 ， 把 他 杀 害 ， 他 也 不 抵 挡 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you. \n [bbe] You have given your decision against the upright man and have put him to death. He puts up no fight against you. \n 5:7 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 哪 ， 你 们 要 忍 耐 直 到 主 来 。 看 哪 ， 农 夫 忍 耐 等 候 地 里 宝 贵 的 出 产 ， 直 到 得 了 秋 雨 春 雨 。 \n [kjv] Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. \n [bbe] Go on waiting calmly, my brothers, till the coming of the Lord, like the farmer waiting for the good fruit of the earth till the early and late rains have come. \n 5:8 [hgb] 你 们 也 当 忍 耐 ， 坚 固 你 们 的 心 。 因 为 主 来 的 日 子 近 了 。 \n [kjv] Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. \n [bbe] Be as calm in your waiting; let your hearts be strong: because the coming of the Lord is near. \n 5:9 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 不 要 彼 此 埋 怨 ， 免 得 受 审 判 。 看 哪 ， 审 判 的 主 站 在 门 前 了 。 \n [kjv] Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door. \n [bbe] Say no hard things against one another, brothers, so that you will not be judged; see, the judge is waiting at the doors. \n 5:10 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 要 把 那 先 前 奉 主 名 说 话 的 众 先 知 ， 当 作 能 受 苦 能 忍 耐 的 榜 样 。 \n [kjv] Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. \n [bbe] Take as an example of pain nobly undergone and of strength in trouble, the prophets who gave to men the words of the Lord. \n 5:11 [hgb] 那 先 前 忍 耐 的 人 ， 我 们 称 他 们 是 有 福 的 ， 你 们 听 见 过 约 伯 的 忍 耐 ， 也 知 道 主 给 他 的 结 局 ， 明 显 主 是 满 心 怜 悯 ， 大 有 慈 悲 。 \n [kjv] Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy. \n [bbe] We say that those men who have gone through pain are happy: you have the story of Job and the troubles through which he went and have seen that the Lord was full of pity and mercy in the end. \n 5:12 [hgb] 我 的 弟 兄 们 ， 最 要 紧 的 是 不 可 起 誓 。 不 可 指 着 天 起 誓 ， 也 不 可 指 着 地 起 誓 ， 无 论 何 誓 都 不 可 起 。 你 们 说 话 ， 是 就 说 是 ， 不 是 就 说 不 是 ， 免 得 你 们 落 在 审 判 之 下 。 \n [kjv] But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation. \n [bbe] But most of all, my brothers, do not take oaths, not by the heaven, or by the earth, or by any other thing: but let your Yes be Yes, and your No be No: so that you may not be judged. \n 5:13 [hgb] 你 们 中 间 有 受 苦 的 呢 ， 他 就 该 祷 告 。 有 喜 乐 的 呢 ， 他 就 该 歌 颂 。 \n [kjv] Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. \n [bbe] Is anyone among you in trouble? let him say prayers. Is anyone glad? let him make a song of praise. \n 5:14 [hgb] 你 们 中 间 有 病 了 的 呢 ， 他 就 该 请 教 会 的 长 老 来 。 他 们 可 以 奉 主 的 名 用 油 抹 他 ， 为 他 祷 告 。 \n [kjv] Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: \n [bbe] Is anyone among you ill? let him send for the rulers of the church; and let them say prayers over him, putting oil on him in the name of the Lord. \n 5:15 [hgb] 出 于 信 心 的 祈 祷 ， 要 救 那 病 人 ， 主 必 叫 他 起 来 。 他 若 犯 了 罪 ， 也 必 蒙 赦 免 。 \n [kjv] And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. \n [bbe] And by the prayer of faith the man who is ill will be made well, and he will be lifted up by the Lord, and for any sin which he has done he will have forgiveness. \n 5:16 [hgb] 所 以 你 们 要 彼 此 认 罪 ， 互 相 代 求 ， 使 你 们 可 以 得 医 治 。 义 人 祈 祷 所 发 的 力 量 ， 是 大 有 功 效 的 。 \n [kjv] Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. \n [bbe] So then, make a statement of your sins to one another, and say prayers for one another so that you may be made well. The prayer of a good man is full of power in its working. \n 5:17 [hgb] 以 利 亚 与 我 们 是 一 样 性 情 的 人 ， 他 恳 切 祷 告 ， 求 不 要 下 雨 ， 雨 就 三 年 零 六 个 月 不 下 在 地 上 。 \n [kjv] Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. \n [bbe] Elijah was a man of flesh and blood as we are, and he made a strong prayer that there might be no rain; and there was no rain on the earth for three years and six months. \n 5:18 [hgb] 他 又 祷 告 ， 天 就 降 下 雨 来 ， 地 也 生 出 土 产 。 \n [kjv] And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit. \n [bbe] And he made another prayer, and the heaven sent down rain and the earth gave her fruit. \n 5:19 [hgb] 我 的 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 中 间 若 有 失 迷 真 道 的 ， 有 人 使 他 回 转 。 \n [kjv] Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; \n [bbe] My brothers, if one of you has gone out of the way of the true faith and another has made him see his error, \n 5:20 [hgb] 这 人 该 知 道 叫 一 个 罪 人 从 迷 路 上 转 回 ， 便 是 救 一 个 灵 魂 不 死 ， 并 且 遮 盖 许 多 的 罪 。 \n [kjv] Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins. \n [bbe] Be certain that he through whom a sinner has been turned from the error of his way, keeps a soul from death and is the cause of forgiveness for sins without number. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/185/2349.html","bookId":63,"book":{"id":63,"title":"雅各书 James","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 神 和 主 耶 稣 基 督 仆 人 的 雅 各 ， 请 散 住 十 二 个 支 派 之 人 的 安 。 [kjv] James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. \u0026...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/185","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:13 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:27 AM"}}
