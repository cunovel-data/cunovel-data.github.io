{"id":16265,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\"Yeah, we drop in just three c.c. from this here tube,\" said Rocco as he expertly twirled the erlenmeyer flask and watched the color shoot past the methyl orange end-point. Whitemarsh was annoyed and said so. \"That\u0027s the sixth straight you\u0027ve missed, and the acid comes out of the burette, not the tube; and you don\u0027t call the graduations c.c., you call them milliliters.\" \"Yeah? Well, here we call it a tube!\" \"And why don\u0027t you go down to the end-point drop by drop?\" \"Because the book don\u0027t say so! That\u0027s why! You technos make me sick. Here we do all the blasted work, and you try to tell us how to do what we\u0027ve been doing for ten years!\" Rocco was beginning to work himself into one of his famous rages. His bull neck was beginning to redden; his eyes started to flash. His entire squat body started to quiver. Whitemarsh wasn\u0027t impressed. Over at the atomic plant, Phobus\u0027s Quercus Mountain, he had bossed a pretty quarrelsome crew of isotope wranglers. He had never dodged a fight in his life. But this was in a chemical laboratory and it surprised him to hear the assistants talk back. The only assistants he had ever known were clear-eyed youths taking a year away from their studies to recoup their tuition money and who tried to copy everything the chemists did. But Whitemarsh was new to the Interspatial Research Center on the Moon, and he still could not figure why the assistants acted as they did. So he waited. Rocco banged the flask down on the stone bench, glared at Whitemarsh for an instant, and then rushed out of the Laboratory, muttering a few obscenities. \"Queer place this,\" mused Whitemarsh, filling up another flask and finishing the titration himself. \"Here the helpers tell the chemists what to do and get mad if we ask them what they\u0027re doing.\" He started to look over Rocco\u0027s notes and ruefully decided all the work would have to be done over again. He was interrupted when a girl opened the door. In the week he had been stationed at IRC, he had been introduced to so many scientists that he had forgotten most of the names, but he remembered all the girls. His former Atomic Plant at Quercus Mountain had had all too few for him not to appreciate them now. Miss Sally Chester was a statuesque chemist with long blonde hair and a luscious figure which she hid under a white lab robe. He managed to stammer some sort of greeting. \"Why Dr. Whitemarsh!\" She seemed somewhat puzzled. \"You\u0027re not actually working with your hands?\" \"I sure am, unless we\u0027re both space struck. Why not?\" \"Well, I suppose it\u0027s all right other places, here we let the Laboratorians do all the manual work. It\u0027s sort of their privilege.\" \"Yes, but their technique\u0027s lousy. I sat here this afternoon and watched that blow-hard Rocco muff six straight end-points in a row and when I asked him how come, he blew his top!\" She laughed at that. She sat down on the lab desk and said, \"You\u0027re absolutely right. Antonio Rocco\u0027s color blind and always misses his Methyl Orange end-points. And he\u0027s been doing them for ten years. But it hurts his feelings to be criticized, you should have been more diplomatic. He\u0027s probably gone to complain to his boss!\" \"His boss? Aren\u0027t we his bosses? On this sheet he\u0027s listed as my assistant.\" \"Actually yes. But traditionally the shop foreman is the leader of the Laboratorians. He certifies them to see that they know their work, signs their time cards and tells them when to take time off. Of course we outline the work they do, check their results and write reports from their data. Normally we come into the lab as little as possible.\" \"But Sally, how the hell do we know that their results are right? This mixed-up outfit is in the hands of a bunch of left-handed prima donnas who don\u0027t know Beilstein from Budweiser!\" She smiled again (and he thought of the ads for Stargleam toothpaste). \"Let\u0027s go over to the Scientists\u0027 Snack Bar and get a cup of coffee, and I\u0027ll tell you a little about the history of this laboratory.\" So he let her lead him out of the individual laboratory into the pastel blue corridor where they followed the spiral runways to the glass enclosed Snack Bar. Here they sat on pale leather chairs and looked out over the expanse of the Central Laboratory. From where he sat, he could see a square mile of magnificent equipment: Serpentine condensers, enormous distillation columns, molecular stills, ultra-centrifuges, electron microscopes, all were spread out before him. Surrounding the central laboratory were the innumerable railings of the corridors leading to the individual offices. Upstairs and downstairs strolled scientists and Laboratorians respectively, all obviously contented. He turned to face Miss Chester who was lolling in the chair beside him. She had poured him a cup of coffee, given him a plate of rolls and was ready to talk. She reminded him that in 2005 it was found necessary to build research laboratories on the Moon to avoid the guided meteorites which the Aliens had been hurling toward the Earth. Since there had also been a shortage of trained scientists, it was necessary to train apprentices to operate the complicated laboratory equipment ... to perform the operations without bothering themselves with the theory. The Laboratorians were needed and they did a good job running specification tests on all the equipment necessary for the interplanetary war. After the war, the Interspatial Corporation had made it the Central Research Laboratory, since this had been the largest aggregation of instruments ever gathered together, and in the ten intervening years, the numbers of college-trained scientists had increased almost ten-fold. As long as the Laboratorians confined their work to the equipment they were familiar with, they were unbeatable. To guide them they had the Book, as the Technical Manual of the Interspatial Corporation was known, and the Laboratorians followed its procedures to the letter. \"But they don\u0027t know why they\u0027re doing things,\" Whitemarsh interrupted. \"The manual\u0027s been in need of revision for the last five years, and research workers don\u0027t use the same tests all the time!\" \"Well that\u0027s right,\" admitted Sally without disagreement. \"I usually have my particular laboratory instructions mimeotyped and bound in a little book. I\u0027ve also got the instructions so fixed that if they do things wrong, I can catch them. And I\u0027ve learned not to modify my instructions orally. That only confuses the men and results in chaos. With a little planning, you can get good work done, and if you don\u0027t mind humoring their whims a little, there\u0027s no reason why you can\u0027t get along with them.\" Whitemarsh wasn\u0027t so sure. He had no objections to jollying his subordinates, but he did draw the line at sloppy lab technique. He escorted Miss Chester to her own office, thanked her for the briefing, and then started to worry on his own. He took the speed elevator up to Dr. Sheridan\u0027s office. The Laboratory director was sympathetic. He looked at the broad-shouldered young giant, Dr. Whitemarsh, and reflected that this man was rated the most promising scientist the Interspatial Corporation ever had. \"You\u0027re damn right, Whitemarsh,\" he told the younger man, pushing him into a chair and offering him a cigarette. \"I\u0027ve been here three years and spent the first two fighting the system. Maybe the trouble goes back to our Board of Directors. They\u0027re all so proud of this shining Research Station on the Moon, that they hate to admit that anything\u0027s wrong. They\u0027ve got the Laboratorians responsible to the Lunar Mines Service—and there it stands. \"So the only thing we can do is wait. Lo Presti the Master Mechanic is up for retirement next year and there\u0027s going to be a big organizational shake-up. Hold tight. After that we may have a free hand.\" So Whitemarsh thanked him and bided his time. He released Rocco back to some other scientist and did his own laboratory work, even though the Laboratorian Council made a written protest. He also spent many hours in the excellent laboratory library, reading all the reports coming out of the Lunar Laboratory over the past ten years. His discoveries amazed him. Theoretically the Lunar Lab had one of the best collections of scientific minds in the Solar System. Every Earth university was represented on its staff. New techniques and products had poured out of the Laboratory during the ten years of its existence, yet every one of these had been based on doubtful data. Certain things worried him. First, notes were kept in a very cavalier manner even by the most experienced scientists. Secondly, the younger chemists and physicists never had been exposed to any practical laboratory work after their student days, and consequently had no means of judging the technique of their assistants. Finally, the Laboratorians were apparently proud of their ignorance, displayed a contempt for \"paper work\" and were only too willing to fix their results if they thought they could get away with it.... He did not let his social development slide either. Lunarport was far more advanced culturally than the crude settlement on Phobus. Here Dr. Whitemarsh was able to have a luxurious apartment in the New Dome sector, could hear lectures and concerts, and could even indulge in winter sports such as skiing in the lava around the craters (protected of course by a heated suit and an oxygen mask.) He found Miss Chester a satisfactory companion for such endeavors, even though she spoke little of her private life or how she had avoided marriage in her twenty-five years. But he played a waiting game with her as well as with the lab job. He admitted to himself that a research chemist\u0027s life at Lunar Lab was a pleasant one, particularly if one didn\u0027t care how accurate one\u0027s results were. Unfortunately, the same quirk which had driven him into science also made him suspicious of all easy methods. He had never recovered from the shock of discovering that just because a reaction worked in a book, it did not necessarily have to do so in a laboratory. Dr. Whitemarsh\u0027s promotion came within five rather than six months. There was some grumbling among the older scientists, but there was not much they could do about it. Kercheval, who had twelve years\u0027 service on the Moon, did not have his Ph.D. and did not care particularly for executive work. Neither did Sturtevant with a doctorate and ten years service. But others objected; even Miss Chester, long one of Whitemarsh\u0027s defenders, felt that the older men deserved at least the chance of refusal. (It never occurred to Whitemarsh that she might have had some ambitions of her own.) He called the group leaders together for a conference the day after his appointment. He was now ensconced behind Sheridan\u0027s desk and was not yet accustomed to having a secretary. The leaders came in grim and resentful. He wasted no words. \"I\u0027m going to reorganize the set-up to get the Laboratorians under us, whether they like it or not. This sloppy technical data and unsubstantiated findings is not my idea of a good lab—nor yours, I\u0027m sure. It\u0027s up to you to show it during the next year. Meanwhile you\u0027ve all been pushed up fifty dollars a month in salary. So long!\" His next step was to call on Lo Presti. The Master Mechanic\u0027s Office was outside the Lab Dome near the Shaft of Lunar Mine No. 1. The old man had been in the preliminary Selenium exploration party and never could forget the old days when he drove the men and robots to find the metal that paid for the cost of the Expedition. The President of the Home Office, Dr. Barker, had never forgotten either, and Lo Presti was always taken care of. The 200 Laboratorians probably caused him more headaches than the five thousand miners ever had, since a delegation visited him every day or so now that Dr. Whitemarsh was rumored in. But the Lo Presti knew that times change too, and realized that the brawling space adventurer did not fit into a sleek world of test tubes and retorts. Ninety-five years old and arrogant as ever, he sat in his office and greeted Dr. Whitemarsh with a bonecrushing handshake. He offered a cigar and Whitemarsh thanked him, lighting a pipe instead. \"I hear from the boys you\u0027ve been cracking down on them,\" he stated. \"No more than you would if you\u0027d been there yourself. What would you do if a driller split a core?\" \"Why I\u0027d give the careless sap a clout that would wake him up. But the Laboratorians aren\u0027t drillers!\" \"That\u0027s right, but that\u0027s the way some of them are muffing their work.\" Lo Presti eyed him appraisingly. \"Aren\u0027t you the same Whitemarsh who capped the crater on Phobus last year?\" \"I sure am. And your Laboratorians are a bevy of Nice Nellies compared to that mutinous bunch of space rats I had with me.\" \"Well, maybe you\u0027re the man for the job at that. The guys don\u0027t put out anymore. Used to be I knew all the gang. I\u0027d look around and see when they were goofing off. Now they\u0027re all such experts, I can\u0027t tell if they\u0027re loafing or just thinking.\" They both laughed at that. Whitemarsh thought it would be a good time to say: \"I don\u0027t want to do anything to your boys for a while until I get my own gang straightened out!\" \"Don\u0027t kid me, Doc,\" responded Lo Presti, \"you know when I retire you\u0027re going to move in and crack down. Well I\u0027m with you!\" So they parted friends. Whitemarsh went back to his office in a happy mood. True, Miss Chester had been avoiding him lately and he had to drink coffee by himself but he now had the foremen on his side and the front office. Now was the chance to reform the laboratory. His first bombshell was the requirement that all the junior chemists should take a qualifying examination. That really caused trouble in paradise. Apparently, all of the younger set had thrown away their books on graduation and remembered only their own specialties. Whitemarsh, from being a pleasant companion at the Snack Bar who discussed skiing and spaceball, had now become an ogre of the first water. The senior chemists chuckled, since they were exempt, and the Laboratorians guffawed aloud to see their harriers in turn harried. In any event there was frenzied activity in the month before the examination and the library staff did yeoman duty. And, no one had threatened to quit. At least almost no one. Whitemarsh was musingly staring out of his office\u0027s Plastoid window at the green eye of Earth when he heard a commotion outside in the ante-room. He looked out to see Sally Chester, and he sensed that their relationship was less than idyllic. \"Let me see that egotistical ass, Whitemarsh,\" she shouted at his secretary who cowered in silk clad finery as the white-coated Valkyrie charged by. \"Be calm,\" he advised her, placing himself strategically behind his desk. \"Calm,\" she screamed, \"how can I be calm when an officious busybody starts getting drunk with power and acting like a Twentieth Century dictator? After all I\u0027ve done for this stinking Lunar Lab, how come that I have to take an exam in freshman chemistry?\" \"I thought you were exempt,\" began the chastened director. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3058/84545.html","bookId":996,"book":{"id":996,"title":"The Laboratorians","description":"简介： Yeah, we drop in just three c.c. from this here tube, said Rocco as he expertly twirled the erlenmeyer flask and watched the color shoot past the methyl orange end-point.
