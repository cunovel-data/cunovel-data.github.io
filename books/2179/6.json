{"id":99685,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"I sneak a few hours of shut-eye post-dawn, when the sun\u0027s chased the moon off and I\u0027m safe. But it\u0027s an uneasy sleep, filled with nightmares of werewolves and a body in revolt. I imagine myself doing awful things, causing chaos. Only it\u0027s not entirely me. It\u0027s a beast with my shape and form, but with a twisted face, fangs instead of teeth, claws instead of nails, blood-soaked hair.\\n\\n Grubbs Grady-monster extraordinaire.\\n\\n When I stumble down the stairs a little after noon, most of the cleaning has been taken care of. Loch tells me Reni had them all up at ten and working like demons. (His choice of phrase is unfortunate.) She had to leave at eleven but left him in charge to make sure nobody slacked off.\\n\\n \"That was some trick you pulled,\" Leon says, sweeping up petals from the living room floor. \"I\u0027d love to know how you did it.\"\\n\\n \"It was magic,\" Charlie says, shooing a butterfly out through an open window.\\n\\n \"A magic trick,\" Leon corrects him.\\n\\n \"No, real magic,\" Charlie insists. \"It was, wasn\u0027t it, Grubbs? I\u0027ve seen the books lying around, about wizards, witches and wotnots. It was real magic, right?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I force a thin smile. \"Just a trick. There\u0027s no such thing as real magic.\"\\n\\n \"But the books-\" Charlie exclaims.\\n\\n \"-are just books,\" I finish tiredly, then go see what state the kitchen\u0027s in.\\n\\n As I\u0027m leaving, I hear Leon mutter, \"Magic! You\u0027re a real ass sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care what he says,\" Charlie sulks. \"I know what I saw. It was real magic. I\u0027d bet a million jelly beans on it.\\n\\n When everything\u0027s as clean as we can get it, my friends say goodbye and make their way home to recover before school on Monday. Bill-E and Loch stay on-they\u0027ve arranged to spend the day here. Bill-E waits till Loch\u0027s in the toilet, then asks how I\u0027m feeling.\\n\\n \"Fine,\" I lie as my brain throbs with a splitting headache and my stomach gives a sickly rumble.\\n\\n \"I heard howling last night,\" Bill-E says. \"After we\u0027d gone to bed. It woke me. A few others too. There was some talk of it this morning but not much-most people were still trying to figure out how you pulled off the trick with the bottle.\"\\n\\n I grunt, saying nothing.\\n\\n \"Grubbs,\" Bill-E says hesitantly, \"I know we\u0027ve never discussed the family curse. You filled me in on the basics in Slawter, but you\u0027ve never offered more information and I haven\u0027t pushed.\"\\n\\n For a long time Bill-E thought Dervish was the one who\u0027d almost changed into a werewolf. I finally told him the truth in Slawter, neglecting only the part about Dervish being his uncle, not his father. I\u0027ve never told Bill-E that we share the same dad. I want to, but he feels a special bond with Dervish, believing him to be his real father. I\u0027ve never had the heart to shatter his illusion.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Bill-E continues after an uncomfortable pause, \"I know I almost turned into a werewolf and that you and Dervish saved me. You faced Lord Loss and won back my humanity. But is the cure definitely permanent?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m safe? For certain?\"\\n\\n \"One hundred per cent,\" I smile.\\n\\n \"What about...?\" He hesitates again. \"Your magic... the howling... Are you safe too?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t answer for a second. Then, quietly, I lie. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t have to lock you up in the cage in the secret cellar?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I laugh edgily. I hate that cellar. I\u0027ve only been there once since we defeated Lord Loss, when Dervish\u0027s nightmares were threatening to destroy his sanity. \"I\u0027m fine. That wasn\u0027t me howling. Probably just a big dog that got loose. Now stop worrying-you\u0027re getting on my nerves.\"\\n\\n Loch returns, wiping his hands dry on his trousers, and the questions stop, though I sense Bill-E doesn\u0027t fully believe me. He knows something\u0027s wrong, that I\u0027m not coming clean. But he doesn\u0027t suspect the worst or anything near it. He trusts me. Thinks of me as his closest friend. Doesn\u0027t believe I\u0027d lie point-blank to him about something this serious.\\n\\n How little he knows.\\n\\n A long, anticlimactic Sunday. Lounging around the house, all three of us bored, flicking through TV channels in search of something decent to watch, sticking CDs on, turning them off just a few tracks in. Loch makes cutting remarks about Bill-E, winding him up. I worry about lycanthropy and magic.\\n\\n \"This is crap,\" Loch mutters, switching the TV and CD player to stand-by. He jumps up and rubs his hands together. \"Let\u0027s wrestle.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not in the mood.\"\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon!\"he prods, slapping my face lightly, trying to sting me into action.\\n\\n \"No,\" I yawn.\\n\\n Loch scowls, then switches his attention to Bill-E. \"How about you, Spleenio?\" He grabs the shorter boy by the waist and swings him round.\\n\\n \"Let go!\" Bill-E shouts, kicking out.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got a live one,\" Loch laughs. He throws Bill-E to the ground, then falls on him and starts to tickle.\\n\\n \"No!\" Bill-E gasps, face red, slapping at Loch like a girl, half-laughing from the tickling, half-crying.\\n\\n \"Leave him alone,\" I mutter angrily-the noise is worsening my headache.\\n\\n Loch stops and stands. \"Sorry, Bill-E,\" he says. \"Let me help you up.\" He lowers his right hand. Bill-E reaches for it and Loch whips the hand away. \"You\u0027re the sultan of suckers, Spleen,\" he chortles, strolling towards the kitchen, shaking his head with amused disgust.\\n\\n Bill-E glares daggers at Loch, then at me. \"Gossel\u0027s scum,\" he hisses. \"I don\u0027t care if he is your new best friend. He\u0027s the scum of the earth. Shame on you for hanging out with him.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take it out on me,\" I snap. \"You want to get Loch off your back? Then face him like a man, not a little girl. He bullies you because you let him.\"\\n\\n \"No, he bullies me because he\u0027s a bully,\" Bill-E retorts, furious tears in his eyes.\\n\\n I shrug, too exhausted and sore-headed to argue. \"Whatever.\"\\n\\n Loch returns and Bill-E shuts up, but he glowers like an old man whose pipe\u0027s been stolen, then storms off and returns with his coat.\\n\\n \"Going home?\" I ask as he buttons it up.\\n\\n \"No,\" he snarls. \"I\u0027m doing what I originally planned to do.\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"You remember. My original plan. If there hadn\u0027t been a party.\" I stare at him blankly and he nods in the direction of the forest.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I chuckle. \"Lord Sheftree.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Bill-E says quickly, shooting me a warning look which I ignore, still sore at him for having a go at me. (And sore at myself too, for not being the friend-the brother-he deserves.)\\n\\n \"You know the stories of Lord Sheftree, the guy who used to own this place?\" I ask Loch.\\n\\n \"The baby and the piranha, yeah, sure.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs...\" Bill-E growls, not wanting to share our secret with an outsider.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a legend about his treasure.\" I take grim satisfaction from Bill-E\u0027s enraged expression.\\n\\n \"Treasure?\" Loch echoes, interest piqued.\\n\\n \"Apparently he had hoards of gold and jewels which nobody ever found. They say he buried it somewhere around here. That it\u0027s still sitting there, underground, waiting...\"\\n\\n Loch squints at me, then at Bill-E. \"This true, Spleenio?\"\\n\\n \"Get stuffed.\"\\n\\n Loch\u0027s face stiffens. \"I asked if it was true,\" he says, taking a menacing step forward.\\n\\n \"Yeah, maybe, so what?\" Bill-E squeaks, shrinking away from Loch.\\n\\n \"Any idea where the treasure is?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n \"Up your butt,\" I chip in, and both Loch and Bill-E laugh, the tension vanishing in an instant.\\n\\n \"Nah, come on, really,\" Loch says, facing me again. \"Is this on the level or is Spleen-boy paying me back for all those false handshakes?\"\\n\\n \"The legend\u0027s real,\" I tell him. \"I don\u0027t know about the treasure. We\u0027ve been all over the forest, dug more holes than a pair of rabbits and found nothing. Right, Bill-E?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bill-E sighs, resigning himself to sharing our secret with Loch. \"But you bury treasure because you want it to be hard to find. There wouldn\u0027t have been much point in Lord Sheftree sticking it where any passer-by could find it. It\u0027s out there, I\u0027m sure, and one day, if we keep trying...\" He trails off into silence, eyes distant.\\n\\n \"I thought you were rich anyway,\" Loch says to me. \"Why are you bothered about a pile of buried treasure?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not. But it would be exciting if it did exist and we found it. Bill-E and I used to spend a lot of our weekends searching for it. Even though we never found anything, the searching was fun.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve given up?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n I shrug. \"Bill-E goes looking every so often, but it\u0027s been a while since I bothered.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been too busy wrestling with lunk-heads,\" Bill-E says sourly, but Loch lets the remark pass.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never searched for treasure,\" Loch says. \"How do you do it-with a metal detector?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Bill-E says. \"We walk around with shovels looking for likely spots. Then we make trial holes. If nothing turns up, we fill in the holes and move on.\\n\\n \"Sounds amateurish,\" Loch says dubiously.\\n\\n Bill-E laughs. \"Like Grubitsch said, the searching is fun. You\u0027d need proper, expensive equipment to go after it seriously. For us it\u0027s always been a game.\"\\n\\n \"What about it?\" Loch asks, casting an eye at me.\\n\\n \"You want to go on a treasure hunt?\" I groan, wishing I could just go back to bed for a few hours.\\n\\n \"It\u0027d beat sitting around here doing nothing,\" Loch says.\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s raining,\" I protest.\\n\\n \"A light drizzle. It\u0027ll clear soon. C\u0027mon, it\u0027s something different.\"\\n\\n \"Not for Bill-E and me.\"\\n\\n \"But it is for me,\" Loch presses.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you and Bill-E go by yourselves?\" I suggest.\\n\\n \"No way!\" they both exclaim at the same time, then share a look and laugh, temporary (very temporary!) allies.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll let him tag along if you come,\" Bill-E says. \"Otherwise I\u0027ll go home. I still have some homework to finish.\"\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon,\" Loch huffs again. \"Don\u0027t be a bloody bore, Grubbs.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" I groan, rising reluctantly. \"Give me a few minutes to change. Loch, you and Bill-E go get some shovels. Bill-E knows where to find them.\"\\n\\n \"Cool!\" Loch grins, slapping Bill-E on the back. \"You leave it to the Spleenster and me-we know what we\u0027re doing.\"\\n\\n \"Just one thing,\" Bill-E says stiffly. \"On the very off chance that we find any treasure, it\u0027s ours. You don\u0027t have any rights to it, understand? I don\u0027t want you going all Treasure of the Sierra Madre on us.\"\\n\\n \"Treasure of where?\" Loch frowns.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a black-and-white movie,\" Bill-E explains as he leads Loch away. \"I\u0027ll fill you in on the plot while we\u0027re fetching the shovels. It\u0027s all about treasure hunters and the destructive nature of paranoid greed...\"\\n\\n The fresh air clears my head a bit, but after an hour of aimless walking and digging I\u0027d still rather be in bed. Loch\u0027s loving it though, digging wildly, accidentally hitting Bill-E with clods of earth every so often to break the monotony. Bill-E doesn\u0027t mind too much. He\u0027s just glad I\u0027m out scouring the forest with him again, even if we do have an extra (unwanted) passenger in tow.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve found a few bits and pieces over the years,\" Bill-E explains as we give up on our third trial dig and refill the hole. \"Old coins, scraps of clothes, half a knife.\"\\n\\n \"Anything worth money?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n \"Not really,\" Bill-E says. \"One of the coins would have been valuable if it had been in better condition, but it was very worn and part of it was missing. Dervish let me keep it.\"\\n\\n \"Why were they buried if they were worthless?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n \"They weren\u0027t,\" Bill-E says. \"The level of the ground\u0027s constantly changing. Things fall or are thrown away. Grass and weeds grow over them. They sink when the ground\u0027s wet. New earth blows over them. In no time at all they\u0027re half a metre underground... a metre... more. The world\u0027s always burying cast-offs and stuff that\u0027s been forgotten. Heck, even the giant Sphinx in Egypt was half-buried once and almost lost forever.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense,\" Loch snorts.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" Bill-E says. \"We did it in history. And there are loads of important places in Egypt today-burial chambers and the like-which are covered up. In some towns they know where they are, but people have built houses over them, so they can\u0027t excavate.\"\\n\\n \"I never learnt any of that in history,\" Loch says suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Bill-E replies smugly, \"maybe if you were in the upper set...\"\\n\\n Loch\u0027s starting to tire of the wandering and digging. I\u0027m glad. Apart from the fact that I\u0027m weary and grumpy, it\u0027s late afternoon and it won\u0027t be much longer before the sun starts to set and an even fuller moon than last night\u0027s rises over the earth like a plum dipped in cream. Maybe Dervish is back already. If so, I want to sit down with him and have a long talk about what\u0027s going on in my life and what we need to do about it.\\n\\n \"This studying,\" Loch grumbles, studying his hand where he cut it on the last dig.\\n\\n \"One more try,\" Bill-E says. \"We\u0027ll quit after that.\"\\n\\n \"Why not now?\" Loch says. \"This is stupid. We\u0027ll never find anything.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an old superstition of ours. When we decide we\u0027ve had enough, we always dig one last hole. Right, Grubbs?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I mutter. \"That\u0027s the way we\u0027ve always done it.\"\\n\\n \"And look where it\u0027s got you,\" Loch snorts, but goes along with the plan, not wanting to be the one who quits first.\\n\\n Bill-E leads us further into the wild bushes of the forest, trying to pick a good spot for the final dig of the day. Briars catch on my trousers and jacket, and one scratches deep into my neck, drawing a few drops of blood and a loud curse. I\u0027m about to call an end to the farce and demand we go home immediately, regardless of superstitions, when something about the landscape makes me pause.\\n\\n We\u0027re in the middle of a thicket, lots of natural shrubs and bushes. It looks much the same as any other part of the forest to the untrained eye, but when you\u0027ve spent a few years exploring a particular area, you see things differently. You get to know the various types of trees, flowers and weeds. You make mental pointers so you can find your way around easily and quickly. I\u0027ve been here before, I\u0027m sure of it, but I can\u0027t remember when...\\n\\n The memory clicks into place. It was shortly before Bill-E turned into a werewolf, before Dervish told me about the Demonata and Lord Loss. Bill-E and I were on one of our treasure hunts. We\u0027d started to dig around here when Bill-E spotted Dervish and went all mysterious. He made me hide, so Dervish didn\u0027t see us, then we followed him. That was the day Bill-E hit me with his theory about werewolves. The day my destiny fell into place and I started on a collision course with Lord Loss and his vile familiars.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s dig here.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Bill-E frowns, studying the ground. \"The earth looks hard.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I say, casting around. \"There\u0027s a soft patch somewhere, between a couple of stones. At least there used to be...\"\\n\\n I find it and give a grunt of satisfaction. I can still see faint marks from where I began to dig previously, a minute or so before Bill-E went weird on me and the world of werewolves claimed me for its own.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you know that was there?\" Bill-E asks.\\n\\n \"Magic,\" I reply with a laugh, then drive my shovel into the soil.\\n\\n Half an hour later, nobody\u0027s laughing. We\u0027re surrounded by three fresh mounds of earth and stones, digging deeper by the minute, cutting down at an angle. There\u0027s a large rock buried just beneath the briars and grass, under the shelter of which the earth and stones lie. There\u0027s rock to either side too. It\u0027s too early to tell for certain, but this looks like the entrance to a tunnel or cave.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" Loch says suddenly, stooping. He comes up holding something golden. My heart leaps. Bill-E and I crowd in on him, jabbering with excitement. Then he holds it up to the dim light and we see it\u0027s just an orangey-yellow stone. \"Damn!\" Loch hurls it away.\\n\\n Bill-E pulls a face and resumes digging. He\u0027s working on the sides, clearing the rock faces, while Loch and I dig straight down. Bill-E pauses after a while and strokes the rock. \"Hard to tell if this fissure is natural or man-made. The sides are smooth, as if they\u0027ve been ground down. But I guess they\u0027d feel just as smooth if nature had done the grinding.\"\\n\\n Loch hits a larger stone and winces. Scrapes around it to find its edges, then inserts the tip of his shovel under one corner and tells me to help him. Together we lever it out, then lift it up on to the bank around us. We\u0027re knee-high in the hole (based on my long legs, not Bill-E\u0027s stumpy pins) by this stage.\\n\\n Loch clears the gap left by the removal of the stone, then scowls. \"There\u0027s another one. Looks even bigger than the first.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s getting rockier the further down we dig,\" I note.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s always the way,\" Bill-E says. \"The heavier stones sink deeper than the smaller ones.\"\\n\\n \"Is it worth carrying on?\" Loch asks. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any treasure here.\"\\n\\n \"How do you figure that?\" Bill-E sneers.\\n\\n \"Common sense,\" Loch says. \"This Lord Sheftree miser would have wanted easy access to his treasure so he could dig it up whenever he liked. This ground\u0027s too rocky. Too much hard work. It would have been easier for him to do it somewhere else.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Bill-E says, \"this is a maniac we\u0027re talking about-the guy fed a baby to his piranha! Who knows what he might or might not have done? Maybe he hired men to dig this hole, then killed them and left them to rot with the treasure. Maybe he had others dig it up every few years so he could put more treasure down there, then killed them too. Heck, there could be dozens of skeletons down there.\"\\n\\n Loch and I share an uneasy glance.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I want to go digging up skeletons,\" Loch mumbles.\\n\\n \"Afraid of a few old bones, Gosselio?\" Bill-E cackles.\\n\\n \"No. But if there are corpses, we shouldn\u0027t disturb their remains.\"\\n\\n \"Not even if they\u0027re sitting on a chest of gold coins?\" Bill-E taunts him. \"Five chests? Ten? Not even if we agree to cut you in on a slice of the profits?\"\\n\\n \"A while ago you said there was nothing in it for me,\" Loch snaps.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t expect an equal share,\" Bill-E drawls, \"but if there\u0027s a fortune and you help us dig it up, we\u0027ll see you right. Won\u0027t we, Grubbs?\"\\n\\n \"Too much talking,\" I grunt, stabbing my shovel into the ground, trying to find a crack I can use to pry out the next big stone. \"Dig.\"\\n\\n Almost sunset. Without discussing it, we come to a halt and study the fruits of our labours. The hole is thigh-deep now. It\u0027s been hard going for the last twenty minutes-one big, awkward stone after another. At least the hole\u0027s no wider than when we started, so we\u0027ve only got to worry about digging down, not out to the sides as well.\\n\\n \"We could be at this forever,\" Loch gasps, wiping sweat from his forehead. All three of us are sweating badly. \"No telling how deep it goes.\"\\n\\n \"What do you say, Bill-E?\" I ask, glancing up at the setting sun, feeling the sickness and headache building within me again. \"Time to stop?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Bill-E agrees. \"We can\u0027t dig in the dark. But we\u0027ll come back, right?\" He looks at me, Loch, then me again. \"We could be on to the find of the millennium. Metres-maybe centimetres- away from Lord Sheftree\u0027s treasure. We can\u0027t walk away from that.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s right,\" Loch says. \"It\u0027s probably just a big old hole, but...\"\\n\\n \"What about next weekend?\" I suggest.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait that long,\" Bill-E says. \"A whole week thinking about it, dreaming of the treasure...\"\\n\\n \"Also, what if somebody else comes by, sees the hole and finishes what we\u0027ve started?\" Loch growls. \"There aren\u0027t any fences around your land, are there?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I clear my throat. \"Actually, this isn\u0027t our land. We don\u0027t own this part of the forest.\"\\n\\n Loch stares at me hard, then at Bill-E, who fidgets uncomfortably. \"You don\u0027t have legal rights to it,\" he says softly. \"You were bluffing, trying to cut me out of any find.\"\\n\\n Bill-E shrugs. \"You wouldn\u0027t have known about the treasure if we hadn\u0027t told you. Anyway, it\u0027s ours-Grubbs\u0027s-by right of birth.\"\\n\\n \"No it\u0027s not,\" Loch objects. \"He isn\u0027t any relation to Lord Sheftree. Dervish just bought the house, that\u0027s all. If I wanted, I could come back here with others and dig without you.\"\\n\\n Bill-E gulps and looks to me for help.\\n\\n \"Thirds,\" I say steadily. \"An equal split. Assuming there\u0027s anything down there. And assuming we get to keep it if there is-for all we know, there are laws that won\u0027t allow us to keep any of it. But if the treasure\u0027s there and we can make a claim, we divide it in three. Agreed?\"\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" Loch says quickly.\\n\\n Bill-E looks disgusted but nods angrily. \"OK.\"\\n\\n \"And we don\u0027t tell anybody, not until we figure out what our rights are,\" Loch adds. \"There\u0027s no point doing all the hard work and not being able to reap the rewards. If we find treasure, we keep our mouths shut and check the law. We might have to wait till we\u0027re eighteen to declare our find. Or maybe we can never declare it. Maybe we\u0027ll have to sell it on the black market.\" He grins. \"The gold and diamond market!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure about that,\" Bill-E says. \"Not revealing a find like this could land us in a lot of trouble.\"\\n\\n \"We can buy our way out of it with the money we make from the treasure,\" Loch laughs. \"Either way, we don\u0027t say anything until we know, right?\" Bill-E and I share a glance, then nod. \"Great. It\u0027s settled.\" He hauls himself out of the hole and lays his shovel aside. \"I don\u0027t know about you two, but I plan to be back here first thing after school tomorrow and every day this week, and the week after, and the week after that, until we get to the bottom of this damn hole. You with me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come,\" Bill-E agrees. \"Not every day-Gran and Grandad would get suspicious if I was late home every evening-but most of the time it shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs?\" Loch asks.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be here,\" I promise, glad to have something to distract me from my recent fears. I look up at the darkening sky and add a proviso. \"But only until dusk. I\u0027m not staying out here nights. Not when the moon\u0027s up.\"\\n\\n Home. Waiting for Dervish. He should have returned by now. I ring his mobile, to check that everything\u0027s OK, but only get his answering message. Sitting in the TV room, TV switched off, no lights on. In my guts and bones I can feel the moon rising. Concentrating on my breathing, willing myself not to change, trying to stay human.\\n\\n Without any sound of a motorbike, the doors open about 10 o\u0027clock and Dervish stumbles in. \"My head,\" he groans, slumping on the couch next to me, a hand thrown over his eyes.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I ask, thinking he\u0027s been in a crash. Then I catch the stench of alcohol. \"You\u0027re drunk!\"\\n\\n \"I forgot how much Meera can drink when she sets her mind to it,\" he mumbles. \"And unlike normal people, she doesn\u0027t have a hangover the next morning. She was at it again first thing when she woke and she made me join in.\" He puts his hands over his ears and moans. \"The bells, the bells!\"\\n\\n \"Tell me you didn\u0027t drive home in this state,\" I snap.\\n\\n \"You think I\u0027m mad?\" Dervish huffs. \"I cast a sobering spell.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re full of it!\"\\n\\n \"No, really, it works perfectly. Except it\u0027s very short term. It ran out when I was almost to Carcery Vale. I had to stop and walk the rest of the way. And the worst thing is, when it wears off, the hangover kicks in with twice as much venom as before.\" Dervish doubles over, head cradled between his hands, whining like a kicked dog.\\n\\n \"Serves you right,\" I sniff. \"You should have more sense at your age.\"\\n\\n \"Please, Grubbs, don\u0027t play mother,\" Dervish groans. He staggers to his feet and heads for the kitchen. \"I\u0027m going to make an absolutely huge cup of hot chocolate, then retire to my room for the night. I don\u0027t want to be disturbed unless the house is burning.\" He pauses. \"Strike that. I don\u0027t want to be disturbed even then. Let me burn-I\u0027d be better off.\"\\n\\n I think about calling him back, making him sit down and listen to me. But it wouldn\u0027t be fair. Better to let him get a good night\u0027s sleep, then tell him about it tomorrow. Besides, I don\u0027t feel too rough at the moment, not as bad as I felt last night. I don\u0027t want to jinx myself, but I think I might be over the worst.\\n\\n Dervish\u0027s snores rock the house to its foundations. I don\u0027t want to sleep. I want to keep a vigil, stay focused on my breathing, alert to any hint of a change. But I\u0027m exhausted. All the energy that went into the party... lack of sleep last night... walking and digging this afternoon. My eyelids refuse to stay open. Even coffee-which I hardly ever drink-doesn\u0027t work.\\n\\n I undress and slip into a T-shirt and boxers. Slide beneath the covers. Lying there, I think that maybe I should get a rope, tie it round my ankles and the bedposts, maybe tie up one of my hands too. That should hold me in the event that I change during the night. A good plan, but it comes too late. Even as I\u0027m gearing myself up to get out of bed and fetch a rope, my eyelids slam down and I\u0027m out for the count.\\n\\n Harsh breathing. Thumping sounds. Cold night air.\\n\\n I come to my senses slowly, the same as last night. I see a pair of hands lifting a large rock out of the ground. They throw it overhead casually as if it was a pebble. They stoop, start clearing more earth away... then stop as I realise they\u0027re my hands. I exert my will and look around.\\n\\n I\u0027m standing in a hole, dressed only in my T-shirt and boxers. Bare feet. Dirt-encrusted fingers. It takes me a few seconds to realise I\u0027m in the hole where we were digging earlier. The reason I didn\u0027t recognise it instantly-it\u0027s about four times deeper than when we left it.\\n\\n I look up. I\u0027m a couple of metres below ground level, surrounded by rock. In a sudden panic, afraid the rocks are going to grind together and crush me, I grab a handhold and haul myself up. A couple of quick thrusts later, I\u0027m standing by the edge of the hole, shivering from cold and fear, staring around with wonder.\\n\\n There are rocks and dirt everywhere. I don\u0027t know how long I was down there but I must have been digging like a madman. The weird thing is, I don\u0027t feel the least bit tired. My muscles aren\u0027t aching. Apart from some scared gasping, my breath comes normally and my heart beats as regularly as if I\u0027d been out for a gentle stroll.\\n\\n I walk over to one of the larger stones. Study it silently, warily. I bend, grab it by the sides, give an exploratory lift. I can shift it a few centimetres and that\u0027s it, I have to drop it. It weighs a bloody tonne. Under any normal circumstances I doubt I could lift it higher than knee level, not without throwing my back out completely. Yet I must have. And not only picked it up, but lobbed it out of the hole too.\\n\\n Back to the rim of the mini abyss. Staring down into darkness. What brought me here? I\u0027d like to think I was just sleepwalking, that I came here because I\u0027d been thinking about the hole all evening. But there\u0027s more to it than that. My senses are on high alert, animal-sharp (wolf-sharp), and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s any accident that I wound up here, digging as if my life depended on it.\\n\\n As much as I don\u0027t want to, I sit, turn and lower myself into the hole. When I\u0027m on the floor, I allow a few seconds for my eyes to adjust, then take a really good look. The hole isn\u0027t any wider than it was earlier-the rocks on the sides run down smoothly, like a mine shaft. The angle which we were following has continued, so although it\u0027s a steep slope, it\u0027s easy to climb up and down.\\n\\n I bend and touch the next rock in line for removal. It\u0027s jammed firmly in the earth. I tug hard and it barely moves. Yet I\u0027m sure, if I\u0027d tried a few minutes ago, while asleep, I could have ripped it out and...\\n\\n Whispers.\\n\\n I frown and cock my head. The sound has been there for a while, maybe since I regained my senses, but I thought it was the wind in the trees. Now that I focus, I realise it\u0027s not coming from the trees. It seems to be coming from the rocks.\\n\\n A jolt of excitement cuts through my confusion and apprehension. Maybe I\u0027m close to a cave and the noise is the wind whistling between earth and rock. I flash on an image of Lord Sheftree\u0027s treasure and the glory of being the first to discover it. With renewed enthusiasm I grasp the rock again and pull as hard as I can. I might not be able to toss it out of the hole, but if I can budge it slightly, maybe I can...\\n\\n A flicker on the rock. A slight bulging. A shadow grows out of it, just for a second, then disappears.\\n\\n I fall backwards, stifling a scream, heart racing.\\n\\n Eyes fixed to the rock, waiting for it to change again. A minute passes. Two.\\n\\n I get to my feet, legs very shaky, and climb out of the hole, not looking back. I make for home quickly, head down, striding through the forest, ignoring the twigs, stones and thorns that jab at my bare feet.\\n\\n Trying hard not to think about what I saw (or thought I saw). But I can\u0027t block it out. It keeps coming back, rattling round the inside of my skull like a rabid rat in a cage.\\n\\n The flicker... the bulging... the shadow...\\n\\n It might have been a trick of the light or my skittish mind, but it looked to me like a face was trying to force its way up through the rock from the other side. A human face. A girl\u0027s. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-6.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \\n \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
