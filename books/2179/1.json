{"id":99680,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"PART ONE - LOCH\n Chapter 1 DAMN THE SANDMAN\n My hands are red with blood. I\u0027m running through a forest. Naked, but I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m an animal, not a human. Animals don\u0027t need clothes.\n Blood on my tongue too. Must have fed recently. Can\u0027t remember if it was a wild creature or a person. Not bothered much either way. Still hungry-that\u0027s all that matters. Need to find something new to chew. And soon.\n I leap a fallen log. As I land, my bare feet hit twigs. They snap and I sink into a pool of mud. I collapse, howling. The twigs bite into me. I catch a glimpse of fiery red eyes peering up out of the mud. They aren\u0027t twigs-they\u0027re teeth! I lash out with my feet, screaming wordlessly...\n ...and mud and bits of bark fly everywhere. I stare at the mess suspiciously, my heart rate returning to normal. I was wrong. I haven\u0027t fallen victim to a monstrous baby with mouths in the palms of its hands and balls of fire where its eyes should be. It\u0027s just a muddy hole, covered with the remains of branches and leaves.\n Scowling, I rise and wipe my feet clean on clumps of nearby grass. As I\u0027m using my nails to pick off some splinters, a voice calls, \"Grubbs...\"\n The name doesn\u0027t register immediately. Then I remember-that\u0027s my name. Or it used to be, once upon a time. I glance up warily, sniffing the air, but all I can smell is blood.\n \"Grubitsch...\" the voice murmurs and I growl angrily. I hate my real name. Grubbs isn\u0027t great, but it\u0027s better than Grubitsch. Nobody ever called me that except Mum and my sister Gret.\n \"You can\u0027t find me,\" the voice teases.\n I roar into the darkness of the forest, then lurch at the bushes where I think the voice is coming from. I tear through them but there\u0027s nothing on the other side.\n \"Wrong,\" the voice laughs, coming from a spot behind me.\n I whirl and squint, but I can\u0027t see anyone.\n \"Over here,\" the voice whispers. This time it\u0027s coming from my right.\n Still squinting, I edge closer, towards the source of the voice. This feels wrong, like it\u0027s a trap. But I can\u0027t back away from it. I\u0027m drawn on by curiosity, but also something else. It\u0027s a girl\u0027s voice and I think I know whose it is.\n Movement to my left, just as I\u0027m about to round a tree. Eight long, pale arms wave in the light of the moon. Dozens of tiny snakes hiss and slither. I cry out with fear and slam into the tree, shielding my eyes from the horror. Seconds pass but nothing attacks. Lowering my arms, I realise the arms were just branches of a couple of neighbouring trees. The snakes were vines, blowing in the wind.\n I feel sick but I force a weak chuckle, then slide around the tree in search of the person who called to me.\n I\u0027m at the edge of a pond. I frown at it. I know this forest and there should be no pond here. But there it lies regardless, the full moon reflected in its still surface. I\u0027m thirsty. The blood has dried on my tongue, leaving a nasty copper-like taste. I crouch to drink from the pond, going down on all fours and lowering my head to the water like a wolf.\n I see my face in the mirror-like water before I drink. Blood everywhere, caked into my flesh and hair. My eyes widen and fill with fear. Not because of the blood, but because I can see the shadow of somebody behind me.\n I start to turn, but it\u0027s too late. The girl pushes my head down hard and I go under. Water fills my mouth and I gag. I try to fight but the girl is strong. She holds me down and my lungs fill. The coppery taste is still there and I realise, as I blink with horrified fascination, that the pond is actually a pool of blood.\n As my body goes limp, the girl pulls me up by my hair and laughs shrilly as I draw a hasty, terrified breath. \"You always were a useless coward, Grubitsch,\" she sneers.\n \"Gret?\" I moan, staring up at the mocking smile of my sister. \"I thought you were dead.\"\n \"No,\" she croaks, eyes narrowing and snout lengthening. \"You are.\"\n I weep as her face transforms into that of a mutant wolf. I want to run or hit her, but I can only sit and stare. Then, as the transformation ends, she opens her mouth wide and howls. Her head shoots forward. Her fangs fasten around my throat. She bites.\n I wake choking. I want to scream but in my imagination Gret\u0027s teeth are locked around my throat. I lash out at my dead sister, still half in the dream world. When my arm fails to connect, I rub at my eyes and my bedroom swims back into sight around me.\n Groaning softly, I sit up and dangle my legs over the edge of the bed. Covering my face with my hands, I recall the worst parts of the dream, then shiver and get up to go to the toilet. No point trying to sleep again tonight. I know from past experience that the nightmares will be even worse if I do.\n I pause in the doorway of the bathroom, suddenly certain that demons are lurking in the shadows. If I turn on the light, they\u0027ll attack. I know it\u0027s ridiculous, a ripple from the nightmare, but despite that my finger trembles in the air by the switch, refusing to press.\n \"The hell with it,\" I finally sigh, stepping forward. Letting my fear have its way on this night, as on so many others, I go about my business in the dark. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-1.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \n \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
