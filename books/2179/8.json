{"id":101101,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Descending slowly, testing each foothold firmly before settling my weight on it. Coming down three abreast, me in the middle, Loch on the left, Bill-E on the right. Loch complains several times about not having a light of his own, but Bill-E refuses to relinquish either of his torches. I\u0027ve been to his house. I know that Ma and Pa Spleen keep several torches around the place, ever fearful of power cuts, determined never to be left stranded in the dark. He could have easily brought another torch for Loch. A mistake or intentional oversight? I don\u0027t enquire. It\u0027s stuffy down here, warmer than I imagined. The air\u0027s not so bad though. I thought it would be stale and thin, but there\u0027s a good supply of it. Easy to breathe. Part of me knows this is madness. It screams from the back of my head, reminding me of what happened last night, the face, the whispers, the throbbing today. It wants me to assert myself, demand we make for the surface, tell Dervish, leave all this for experienced potholers to explore. But a larger part thinks it\u0027s thrilling. We\u0027re the first humans to come down here in decades. In fact, if the others are wrong and this wasn\u0027t used by Lord Sheftree, maybe we\u0027re the first people to ever find it. Maybe it will turn out to be an amazing geographical feature and we\u0027ll get to name it and be on the news. Reni would really dig being a celebrity\u0027s girlfriend. You\u0027re an idiot, the cautious part of me huffs with disgust. \"Put a sock in it,\" I grunt back. I lose track of time pretty quickly. Have we been down here ten minutes? Twenty? The hands of my watch are luminous, so I could check. But I\u0027m not going to start fiddling around in the dark, rolling up my sleeves, leaning forward to squint. I\u0027m keeping both hands on the rock face and all my senses focused on the climb. I go carefully, one hold at a time. Foot-hand-foot-hand-foot-hand-foot. Bill-E and Loch are the same. We don\u0027t speak. My torch hangs from my right wrist by a strap. The light bounces off the rocks. I\u0027d have to stop, turn around, lean back and point the light down to get a clear view of what lies beneath. But I\u0027m not going to do that. I\u0027m taking no chances. The thought of slipping... sliding... tumbling into the unknown... Foot-hand-foot-hand-foot-hand-foot-ha- I touch ground. Or a very large overhanging rock. Can\u0027t tell yet. \"Wait,\" I call softly to the others, who are slightly higher than me. \"Let me feel around a bit. I think...\" I extend my foot outwards. More rock. I tap it-solid. Gently lower my other foot, still holding tight to the wall. Gradually letting my full weight shift to my feet, I release my grip and stand unsupported. The ground holds and my stomach settles. Bringing up my torch, I shine it around and gasp. A cave. Not the largest I\u0027ve ever been in, but a reasonable size. Lots of stalactites and stalagmites. A waterfall to my right. I should have heard the noise before now, except my breath and heartbeat were heavy, muffling my hearing. \"Grubbs,\" Loch hisses. \"Are you OK? What is it?\" \"I\u0027m fine,\" I whisper, then raise my voice. \"It\u0027s a cave.\" I shine the light on the floor around my feet, making sure I\u0027ve truly struck bottom. I spot the shovel which Bill-E dropped. \"It\u0027s OK,\" I tell my friends. \"You can come down.\" They detach themselves from the wall and stand beside me. The light from Bill-E\u0027s torches mingles and crosses with mine and we gaze around in awed wonder. The formations are beautiful, some of the most incredible I\u0027ve ever seen. Water drips slowly from the tips of many stalactites, so this is an active cave, still growing. I recall lectures from a couple of class trips to caves. It can take thousands of years for spikes to form. Thousands more for them to alter. If I lived to be a hundred and came back here just before my death, this cave would probably look no different than it does right now. \"It\u0027s amazing,\" I sigh, taking a step forward, head tilted back, looking up to where the roof stretches ahead high above us. \"How can this have been here all this time... hidden away... nobody knowing?\" \"The world\u0027s full of places like this,\" Bill-E answers even though I wasn\u0027t really asking him. \"We only see a fraction of what\u0027s on offer. People find new caves, mountains, rivers, all the time.\" \"OK,\" Loch says loudly, shattering the mood. \"It\u0027s a lovely cave, beautiful, glorious, la-dee-da-dee-dum. But I don\u0027t see any treasure.\" \"Peasant!\" Bill-E snarls. \"This is the treasure. You couldn\u0027t buy a cave like this, not with all the gold and diamonds in the world.\" \"I don\u0027t want to,\" Loch says sourly. \"What good\u0027s a damp, dirty cave? I\u0027ll settle for the gold and jewels.\" He looks around and spits. \"If there are any.\" Bill-E turns, temper fraying. I speak up quickly. \"He\u0027s right, Bill-E. Not about the cave not being worth anything-it\u0027s amazing, beyond any price. But we came looking for a different sort of treasure. We should check to see if it\u0027s here. If it isn\u0027t, that doesn\u0027t matter-we\u0027ll still have found the cave. But if there\u0027s treasure too, all the better.\" Bill-E relaxes. \"Yeah, let\u0027s look. The cave isn\u0027t that big. If there\u0027s treasure, it shouldn\u0027t be too hard to find.\" We move forward, three explorers in wonderland. Even Loch looks impressed, although he isn\u0027t blown away by the cave\u0027s beauty in the same way as Bill-E and me. We stroke the rising pillars, fingers coming away damp. In certain places the stalactites and stalagmites have grown together to form giant, solid structures which join the floor and ceiling. One is wider than the three of us put together, a monster resembling a couple of massive chimneys. \"I\u0027ve never been down a cave without a guide, or in such a small group,\" Bill-E says after a while. \"It\u0027s strange. Quiet. Peaceful.\" \"Hey,\" Loch grins. \"You know my favourite bit when I\u0027m down a cave? It\u0027s when they turn the lights out so you can see what it looks like pitch black.\" \"No way!\" I say quickly. \"Uh-uh!\" Bill-E chimes in. \"What\u0027s the matter, ladies?\" Loch laughs. \"Scared of the dark?\" Bill-E and I share a look. Neither of us wants to switch the torches off. But Loch\u0027s smirking goadingly. If we don\u0027t meet his challenge, we\u0027ll never hear the end of it. \"Go on,\" I mutter to Bill-E. \"You first.\" He gulps and turns one light out, then the other. The cave feels much smaller now, more threatening. It\u0027s probably my imagination but I believe I can sense shapes in the shadows, waiting to form fully in the darkness so they can leap forward and pounce on us unseen. My finger hovers over the switch on my torch. I\u0027m torn between not wanting to look like a coward and not wanting to fall prey to forces of magical malevolence. Before I can make a decision, Loch does it for me. \"What a sissy,\" he crows, then reaches over, jams my finger down hard and jerks it backwards, quenching the light. My heart races. My breath stops. The walls seem to grind shut around me. In a panic I try to turn the torch on, but my finger\u0027s numb from where Loch pressed down on it. I can\u0027t find the switch! I can\u0027t turn the light on! The shapes are coming! In a second or two they\u0027ll be upon us, all claws, sharp teeth and... Bill-E switches one of his torches on. He\u0027s chuckling weakly. \"That was cool.\" I look around-nothing. The cave looks exactly the same as it did before. I was imagining the danger. I force a short laugh and switch my torch on, then press ahead with Bill-E and Loch. We continue exploring. After half an hour I don\u0027t feel too hot. It\u0027s nothing to do with the temperature of the cave-it\u0027s warmer down here than it was on the surface-but with the time. I check my watch to confirm what I already know-it\u0027s night. High above, hidden from sight by the layers of rock and earth, the moon\u0027s rising, and tonight it\u0027s as full as it\u0027s ever going to be. I get the same sick feeling as last night and the night before, only stronger, relentless. In horror movies, people sometimes don\u0027t change into werewolves unless they sight the moon-if it\u0027s hidden by clouds, or they\u0027re locked away, it doesn\u0027t affect them. But that\u0027s rot. The moon\u0027s a powerful mistress. She can reach through any wall or covering and work her wicked charms. Bill-E and Loch are bickering about the treasure and whether or not it\u0027s here. Loch doesn\u0027t think it is-we\u0027ve been around the cave a few times and found nothing-but Bill-E still insists it could be. \"You don\u0027t think Lord Sheftree would have left it lying on the floor for anyone to stumble across and walk off with, do you?\" he argues. \"He\u0027d have thought about somebody finding the cave, either by digging down like we have, or maybe through some other entrance he didn\u0027t know about. He\u0027d have hidden the treasure, stuck it out of sight, so that even if a stranger wandered in by accident, they wouldn\u0027t find it, not unless they actively searched for it.\" \"So where do you think it is, geniass?\" Loch sneers. \"We\u0027ve looked everywhere. Unless it\u0027s invisible treasure, I don\u0027t think-\" \"We\u0027ve looked nowhere,\" Bill-E shouts, and his voice echoes tinnily back at us. \"Some of the larger stalagmites might be hollow,\" he says, quieter this time. \"The treasure might be buried in one of them.\" \"There\u0027s an awful lot of stalagmites,\" Loch says dubiously. \"We have time,\" Bill-E smiles. \"And maybe it\u0027s not down here at all.\" He points up at the walls. \"There are ledges, holes and tunnels, maybe smaller caves-or, for all we know, bigger caves. This could be nothing more than the entrance to a system of huge, interlinked caverns. We\u0027ve lots of exploring still to do. We\u0027ve only scratched the surface.\" \"Let\u0027s do it another time,\" I mutter, head pounding, feeling as though I\u0027m surrounded by a layer of fire. \"It\u0027s night. Time to go home.\" \"Not yet,\" Loch snaps. \"I don\u0027t have to be home for a few more hours.\" \"Bill-E...\" I groan. \"Well, Gran and Grandad will be expecting me back soon,\" he says. \"But it\u0027s not like I\u0027ve never been late before. I\u0027ll tell them I was with you, that we lost track of time-which isn\u0027t a total lie.\" I want to scream at them. The fools! Can\u0027t they feel it? Even through my sickness, with a brain that\u0027s being hammered to a pulp by a searing headache, I can sense danger. The throbbing\u0027s back, stronger than ever. We need to get out now, quick, before... Or am I imagining the danger, like I imagined the monsters in the dark? Maybe it\u0027s just my sickness that we have to fear and this is only a beautiful, eerie cave. Even so, if I turn into a werewolf here, that\u0027s more than enough for any pair of humans to worry about. Trapped underground with a supernaturally strong wolfen beast, Bill-E and Loch wouldn\u0027t last five minutes. \"Look,\" I snap, \"we have to go. We\u0027ll come back tomorrow and explore fully. But it\u0027s dark up top-it\u0027s night. We said we\u0027d go when the moon rose.\" I stop, gather my thoughts and try a different approach. \"We don\u0027t want to draw attention to ourselves. If we come home late, caked in mud and dirt, what will everyone think? If they start asking questions...\" \"He\u0027s got a point,\" Bill-E concedes. \"Gran and Grandad put Sherlock Holmes and Watson to shame. We should play it safe, act normally, especially if we\u0027re going to be coming here a lot.\" \"OK,\" Loch sighs. \"But one more search before we leave.\" He points to the top of the waterfall, where it comes gushing out of the sheer rock wall fifteen metres above the cave floor. \"Up there, those large holes. We can climb up pretty easily. I want to have a peek at them. Then we can go.\" \"I dunno,\" Bill-E says. \"They\u0027re fairly high and that wall\u0027s steeper than the one we climbed down.\" \"What\u0027s a wall to three hardy explorers like us?\" Loch laughs. \"It won\u0027t take long. And if the treasure\u0027s there, we can go home on a total, triumphant high.\" \"Grubbs?\" Bill-E asks. I shake my head violently. I think I\u0027m going to throw up. I\u0027m trembling helplessly. Climbing\u0027s the last thing on my mind. \"Are you all right?\" Bill-E asks, training his twin lights on me. \"Some kind of bug,\" I gasp. \"I\u0027ve had it for the last few days.\" \"Maybe we should get him home,\" Bill-E says. \"Sure,\" Loch grunts. \"Right after we\u0027ve explored above the waterfall.\" He slaps Bill-E hard on the back. \"Come on, Spleenario-last one up\u0027s an asswipe!\" The ploy works. Bill-E forgets about me. They race to the wall and climb. Loch\u0027s laughing, teasing Bill-E, roughly urging him on. I turn my back on the pair, leaving my torch pointing in their direction, to provide some extra light for them. I stumble away and sink to my knees. Lean my head against one of the smaller stalagmites and groan softly. I feel like a corpse that\u0027s been stuck in a microwave to defrost-half frozen, half on fire. I try to control my breathing, to think calm thoughts, but my head\u0027s full of wild, animalistic images-running, chasing, ripping, fangs, blood. I stare at my fingers-they\u0027re curling inwards. I can\u0027t straighten them, no matter how hard I try. I search within for magical warmth, the energy I\u0027ve drawn upon over the last forty-eight hours, but it doesn\u0027t seem to be there for me now. Maybe the cave\u0027s got something to do with that. Or maybe I\u0027m just out of fighting spirit. Out of resistance. Plumb out of luck. \"Not... going... to... turn,\" I snarl. Thinking of Loch and Bill-E, what I could do to them. Cursing myself for being so slack, not going to Dervish when I had the chance, allowing this to happen. I see now that it was fear, plain and simple. It didn\u0027t matter what state Dervish was in-I should have told him the minute he got back. I kept the news to myself because I was scared of what he\u0027d do. I was hoping the charms of the moon would pass, that I was just ill, imagining the inner struggle. The same fear which kept me from learning the ways of magic stopped me telling my secret to Dervish. Grubbs Grady-coward of the county. And now Bill-E and Loch are set to pay the price for my cowardice. I try yelling a warning, telling them to stay up high where I can\u0027t reach them. But my throat won\u0027t work. The vocal cords are constricting, thickening, cutting off my air supply. I guess since wolves can\u0027t talk they don\u0027t need all the throat muscles that humans do. I pull my head back from the stalagmite, meaning to run, get to the surface if I can, before I change. Put space between myself and my friends. Lots of space. But then I see the face again. It\u0027s in front of me. Bulging out of the stalagmite, as though carved out of rock. A girl\u0027s face. Similar to Gret\u0027s, as I noticed before, but not hers. Different. Younger. Darker hair. Smaller. Eyes and lips closed. Like a death mask. The whispering, stronger than last night, more insistent. Certain words break through, but they\u0027re not words I know. A foreign language. Harsh and fast. I\u0027m staring at the face, listening to the whispers, held firm to the spot, feeling myself change, when suddenly- A scream. Behind me. At the waterfall. As I turn towards it, there\u0027s another scream. Then a very loud thud. Then nothing. I race across the cave, grabbing the torch on the way, lycanthropic fears momentarily forgotten, blocking out thoughts of the face and sounds of the whispers. There\u0027s a figure on the ground and it\u0027s not moving. That\u0027s where all my concerns focus now. I reach the figure and gently turn it over. It\u0027s Loch. Face ashen. Eyelids flickering. Mouth opening and closing softly. \"Loch?\" I murmur, holding his head up, trying to see how bad the damage is. I feel something wet and sticky smeared around the back of his head. I don\u0027t have to check to know that it\u0027s blood. Scrabbling sounds. Bill-E hits the ground hard, feet first, having jumped from a spot two or three metres above. \"Is he OK?\" he shouts, panting hard. \"I don\u0027t know. What happened?\" Bill-E gulps, kneels, stares at Loch\u0027s head and my bloody hands. \"He fell,\" Bill-E croaks. I almost can\u0027t hear him-the whispering\u0027s louder than ever, the words coming fast and furious. \"We were climbing. He slipped. I... I reached for him. He wasn\u0027t far away. I grabbed. But he fell. I couldn\u0027t catch him. I tried but I couldn\u0027t...\" \"Just as well you didn\u0027t,\" I comfort him. \"He\u0027d have dragged you down with him. Take off your coat.\" Bill-E gawps at me. \"For under his head.\" Bill-E shrugs off his jacket and balls it up. While I hold Loch\u0027s head, he lays it underneath, then I softly lower Loch down. His eyes haven\u0027t opened. He\u0027s breathing raggedly. This isn\u0027t good. \"I told him not to go up there,\" Bill-E says hollowly. He\u0027s crying. \"I warned him. But he wouldn\u0027t listen. He thought he knew it all.\" \"Hush.\" I\u0027m calmer than my brother. I\u0027ve seen worse things than this. Blood doesn\u0027t alarm me. \"One of us has to go for help. The other needs to stay here, sit with Loch, look after him.\" \"I\u0027ll go,\" Bill-E says quickly. \"Please, Grubbs, I don\u0027t want to stay. Not in this cave. It\u0027s too dark. Please don\u0027t make me-\" \"OK,\" I shush him. \"You can go. Find Dervish. Tell him what happened. He\u0027ll know what to do. But run, Bill-E. Run!\" Bill-E nods, stumbles to his feet, stares at Loch\u0027s face, opens his mouth to say something, then races for the exit. I hear him scrambling upwards-but only barely, over the sound of the whispers-then turn my attention on Loch and the dark pool spreading out from beneath his head and Bill-E\u0027s blood-soaked jacket. Talking to Loch. All sorts of nonsense-school, the treasure, holidays, girls, wrestling. I\u0027ve put my coat and jumper over him. Have to keep him warm. His breathing comes jaggedly. His eyelids have stopped twitching. His heartbeat\u0027s irregular. I keep on talking, rubbing his arms and chest, but I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m doing much good. The sickness is still in me. My head feels ripe to burst. Sometimes my words come out as growls, and my fingers clench while I\u0027m rubbing Loch, digging into his cold, clammy flesh. I fight it. Search within for warmth, energy, magic-anything. I can\u0027t change, not until Dervish comes, not until Loch\u0027s in an ambulance on his way to hospital, safe. \"Won\u0027t turn,\" I snarl, slapping my cheeks one after the other. \"I\u0027m not a wolf. I can control myself. Won\u0027t let the moon...\" Loch shudders. His breath stops. I thump his chest hard-then remember first aid classes at school. Opening his mouth, I press firmly down on his chest, then release him and count. One, two, three, four. Press and count again. A third time. I place my lips over Loch\u0027s. Breathe out, so that his cheeks puff up. Withdraw. Press-two, three, four. Press-two, three, four. Press-two, three, four. Mouth-to-mouth. Trying to remember if I\u0027m doing it right. Was it three presses on the chest, or four, or five? Should I blow air firmly down Loch\u0027s throat or- Loch coughs and breathes again. I sink back, whining with relief and fear. That was too close. This can\u0027t be happening. We were looking for treasure. Messing about. Loch was teasing Bill-E. Everything was normal. You can\u0027t suddenly go from that to a life-or-death situation like this. Except I know from past experience that you most certainly can. Besides, things weren\u0027t normal-the face, the whispers, the throbbing, the sense that we were in danger. I should have been more forceful. Made them leave. Insisted they go home. The sickness within me grows. The noise of the whispers increases. Loch\u0027s blood continues to flow. Still talking. Telling Loch he\u0027s got to stay alive for Reni\u0027s sake. \"She\u0027ll be a mess for years if you die,\" I sob. \"Trust me, I know what losing a sister does to your head. You can\u0027t leave her, Loch. She needs you. It feels like hours since Bill-E left. Loch stopped breathing again a few minutes ago. I resuscitated him, but it took longer than the first time. I was in floods of tears by the end of it-sure I\u0027d lost him. What\u0027s keeping them? Damn it, they should be here by now. Don\u0027t they know how perilous this is, how much danger Loch\u0027s in? I can\u0027t keep him alive forever, not by myself. If they don\u0027t- Loch\u0027s breath stops again. Cursing, I start with the chest pressing and mouth-to-mouth. The beast within me wants to suck in air, not breathe it out. It wants to draw the life from Loch, feed on all that blood around his head and shoulders, sip from that terrible pool, dark in the dim light of the torch. If I dropped my guard, just for a few seconds, there\u0027s no telling what it-I-would do. The whispers increase. It\u0027s like I\u0027m being shouted at now. I want to roar back at them but I need all my breath for Loch. Press-two, three, four. Press-two, three, four. Mouth-to-mouth. Nothing\u0027s happening. I don\u0027t panic. It was like this last time. I just have to keep going, stay calm, stick with it. He\u0027ll revive eventually. Press-two, three, four. Press-two, three, four. Press... It doesn\u0027t work. No matter how much I press and breathe, Loch doesn\u0027t respond. His face has shut down. His lungs don\u0027t move. His heart is still. Third time unlucky. \"No,\" I whisper. \"I don\u0027t accept this. He can\u0027t be... \"No!\" I bring my hands up, meaning to press again, harder than before, wildly. But something about Loch\u0027s expression stops me. It\u0027s peaceful, calmer than it ever was in life. Staring at him, I know with total, awful certainty-he\u0027s lost. I could press and breathe from here till doomsday and it wouldn\u0027t make the slightest bit of difference. Loch Gossel is dead. Stumbling around the cave. The whispers deafening. Tears streaming down my cheeks. The wolf within me howling to be set free. Loch dead. Muttering, \"This can\u0027t be so. This can\u0027t be so. This...\" My right foot hits either a large stone or small stalagmite. I fall flat. As I\u0027m picking myself up, the face of the girl forms in the floor in front of me. Her expression is the same as Loch\u0027s. I gaze at her in horror. This is what Loch will be like for all eternity, or at least until his body rots. Blank, lifeless, ever still, ever serene, ever- The girl\u0027s eyes snap open. Her lips part. She shouts at me, words I can\u0027t understand. I scream and propel myself backwards. Scream again. Halfway through, it turns into a howl. With an effort, I force the howl down, then fix my eyes on the face in the floor. \"No,\" I snarl, pressing my hands hard against the sides of my head. \"NO!\" I roar. Something shoots out of me. A force I haven\u0027t felt in all its power since I fought Lord Loss and his familiars in Slawter. I shut my eyes, feeling energy zap out of me. The scream rises and rises. I feel as if I\u0027m floating above the ground. I think if I opened my eyes I\u0027d find that I am floating. I hold the scream, the cords in my throat feeling like they\u0027re going to burst, until... A sound like cannon fire. Then sudden silence. The scream dies away. My head flops. I collapse. My hands come away from my head, to protect my face from the fall. When I sit up, I\u0027m breathing hard and crying. But the whispering has stopped. I glance at the spot in the floor. The girl\u0027s face has disappeared. And I don\u0027t feel sick anymore-only small, lonely and scared. Standing, I shine the torch around, trying to pin down the source of the cannon fire. It only takes a few seconds to spot it-a large crack in one of the walls, close to the waterfall, which wasn\u0027t there before. Did I divide the rock with my magical scream, or is the crack coincidence, the result of air flowing into the cave or a change of temperature? I don\u0027t know. At this particular moment, I don\u0027t really care. I stagger over to Loch and slump beside his lifeless form. Impossible to believe he\u0027ll never move again, or laugh, or wrestle. You think your friends are never going to die, that all the people you know and care for will be with you forever. Then the world makes a fool of you, so quickly, so simply, that you wonder whether any of your family or friends will see out another day intact. I want to bring him back. I want to shake him, kick him, pump magic into him, make him breathe, make him live. It should be easy, like starting a stalled car or a crashed PC. There should be rules, instructions, things you can do. But there aren\u0027t. When it comes to humans, death\u0027s death, that\u0027s that, and you\u0027re a fool if you think any different. Crying, I lean over Loch to hug his empty shell and tell him how unfair this is, how good a friend he was, how he shouldn\u0027t be dead, how much I want him to live, how scared I am. And it\u0027s only when I grab his shoulders and haul him up, pulling his head in towards my chest, that I realise-his head, the coat and the area around his shoulders... they\u0027re all dry. At first, I\u0027m so distraught I don\u0027t understand why that should be so strange, why it strikes me as being out of place. I\u0027m about to dismiss it, to banish it from my thoughts, when the significance hits and I do a confused, incredulous double-take. Then, because I still can\u0027t make sense of it, I cry the question out loud, in case giving it a voice will help me find an answer. \"Where the hell has all the blood gone?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-8.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
