{"id":99689,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"I spend the rest of the week off school. Strangely enough, I\u0027d rather go in. It\u0027s dull as hell hanging out at the house all the time, brooding, only Dervish for company. I want something to take my mind off Loch\u0027s death and all the other stuff. I want to be with my friends, talk about the tragedy, put it behind me, get on with life. But it\u0027s expected that I take the week off to recover, so I do. I try hard not to think about the folder or the Lambs. Like Dervish said, the curse has been in our family a long time. Some parents kill their own children if they turn, but many can\u0027t bring themselves to be executioners. Generations ago, the Lambs were formed to deal with that problem. The wealthier members of our clan founded and continue to fund them. It\u0027s their job to kill teenagers who\u0027ve turned into werewolves. They also experiment on some of the beasts, in the hope of unlocking the genetic secrets of the family curse and curing it. Dervish doesn\u0027t have much to do with the Lambs. He mistrusts them. He always planned to kill Bill-E or me himself if the worst came to pass-there\u0027s nothing like the personal touch. But my uncle\u0027s been through a lot these last few years. He looks as strong as ever, but looks can be deceiving. Maybe he doesn\u0027t feel he has the strength to deal with me if I turn. I don\u0027t like the Lambs either. I\u0027ve only met one of them, but she was a cold, creepy woman, and the whole idea of letting strangers put me down like a wild dog fills me with distaste. Dervish has made it clear in the past that he would put me out of my misery if such a drastic step was ever called for. I can understand why he might want to retract that promise now, but understanding doesn\u0027t make it any easier to accept. As childish as it might seem, I feel like he\u0027s betrayed me. Bill-E manages to come over on Thursday, after Dervish argued hard on the phone for a couple of days to persuade Ma and Pa Spleen to let him out of the house. He looks shell-shocked. Pale and sickly. His lazy left eyelid flutters so much it looks like worms are wriggling beneath the flesh. He doesn\u0027t say much, which is unusual for Bill-E. Listens numbly while Dervish explains about the cave and why we had to move the body. Doesn\u0027t seem too bothered by the threat of a demon invasion. \"I rang Loch\u0027s house,\" Bill-E says when we\u0027re alone in the TV room. I stare at him, not sure how to respond. I wanted to ring Reni all week but didn\u0027t dare. \"His father answered,\" Bill-E continues. \"I could tell he\u0027d been crying. I wanted to say sorry, ask how they were, if there was anything I could do. But I couldn\u0027t speak. My mouth dried up. In the end he put the phone down. He didn\u0027t get angry. He just sounded sad.\" Bill-E\u0027s staring off into space. The way this has hit him, you\u0027d think it was his best friend who\u0027d died, not a bully he didn\u0027t like. But maybe that\u0027s why it\u0027s harder for him than me. Guilt\u0027s mixed up with grief. I think he\u0027s sorry for all the bad thoughts he had about Loch, the foul names he no doubt called him behind his back, the times he probably wished his tormentor was dead. \"I\u0027m going back to school on Monday,\" I tell Bill-E. \"What about you?\" He shakes his head. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"You should. It might help.\" \"Gran and Grandad don\u0027t want me to. They said I could stay at home as long as I want. Said they\u0027d hire a private tutor.\" The meddlesome, selfish old buzzards! I probably shouldn\u0027t be too hard on them. They\u0027re old and lonely. Bill-E\u0027s all they have. I can understand why they want him to themselves, locked up safe where they can fuss over him twenty-four seven. But they should know better. He needs to be out in the real world, getting back to normal as soon as possible. \"I remember you telling me about when your mum died,\" I say softly. Bill-E looks at me, eyes coming into focus. \"Your gran and grandad kept you indoors for a year. You didn\u0027t speak to anybody else. You fought with other kids who tried to talk to you.\" \"Then I got whacked in the jaw by a boy in a shop,\" Bill-E laughs jerkily. \"And that put you straight.\" I sit beside him. I think for a moment of putting an arm around him but decide against it-no need to go overboard. \"Don\u0027t cut yourself off from your friends, Bill-E.\" \"Do I have any?\" he asks sadly. \"You know you do,\" I snap. \"Maybe not as many as you wish, but there are plenty of people who like you and feel sorry for you, who\u0027ll help you through this. But they can\u0027t if you shut yourself off, if you let your gran and grandad smother you. Come back to school. Move on. You know it makes sense.\" \"Loch can\u0027t move on,\" Bill-E sighs. \"No,\" I agree stiffly. \"He can\u0027t. But we didn\u0027t die in that cave. We\u0027re alive. Loch isn\u0027t and that\u0027s a wretched shame. But life goes on. Loch goes to a grave, we go back to school. That\u0027s how it has to be.\" Bill-E nods slowly. \"Are you going to the funeral?\" \"I don\u0027t want to but I think I need to.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" Bill-E whispers. \"I can go back to school but not... \"That\u0027s OK,\" I smile. \"School will be torture enough.\" Bill-E returns the smile briefly, then stares off into space. \"I can still hear his scream,\" he mutters. \"And I can see his face. His eyes... He didn\u0027t know he was going to die. There wasn\u0027t terror in his expression, just worry. And a bit of anger. He should have looked more terrified. If he\u0027d known...\" We sit there for hours after that, TV off, sniffling occasionally, but otherwise as silent as Loch must be. Friday. The funeral. It\u0027s horrible. And that\u0027s all I\u0027m saying about it. Monday. School. Everyone staring and whispering. Kids scurry out of my way. It\u0027s like the Grim Reaper\u0027s walking alongside me. I spot the gang in one of our usual hangouts behind the cafeteria, sheltering from the rain. Talk dries up as I approach. When I stop, they stare at me, I stare at them, and for a few long seconds nothing is said. Then Charlie breaks the silence with, \"Loch must have been mad as hell, looking down on his funeral-he hated flowers. And having to wear a suit as well!\" Everybody laughs. \"You\u0027re an ass, Charlie,\" Frank giggles. \"Don\u0027t say anything like that in front of Reni,\" Shannon warns him. \"Please,\" he huffs. \"I\u0027m not a total screwball.\" The laughter fades. Frank clears his throat. \"Was it really bad?\" \"Crapville,\" I say tightly. \"Did he say anything before he... you know?\" Mary asks. I nod soberly. \"His last words... I had to strain to hear them... he...\" I cough and everyone leans in close to listen. \"He said... his voice a painful croak... fighting for breath... eyes locked on mine... \u0027Mary Hayes has a face like a cow\u0027s dirty rear.\u0027 \" Mary roars with fury and clubs me with her bag. The others laugh. Then the bell goes and we march into class. Back to normal-or as much as it can be. A rumour at lunchtime. Misery Mauch has gone on sick leave. A mental breakdown. Some say he was overcome with grief when he heard about Loch, but that\u0027s rubbish-Loch never went to see Misery. Apparently he\u0027s been replaced by a woman. They say she\u0027s quite young, though nobody\u0027s had a good look at her yet-she\u0027s been in Misery\u0027s office most of the day. I don\u0027t see Bill-E during lunch. He\u0027s with the new counsellor. I hope she\u0027s got more of a clue than old Misery. Bill-E needs professional help, not some over-eager do-gooder. I\u0027ll have to check her out, make sure she\u0027s not going to mess him up even further. Grubbs Grady-rooter-out of frauds! Halfway through geography, a kid from a lower year delivers a note to my teacher. The new counsellor wants to see me. Guess I\u0027ll get to give her the once-over a bit sooner than I thought. I\u0027m kept waiting outside the office for a few minutes before I\u0027m called in. The counsellor is standing by the side of Misery\u0027s desk when I enter, her back to me. When she turns round, I almost drop through the floor. A slender woman of medium height, in her late thirties or early forties. Smartly dressed, more like a businesswoman than a teacher. Pretty but not gorgeous. Very little make-up. Pure white hair tied back in a pony tail. Extremely pale skin. Pinkish eyes. She\u0027s an albino. But that\u0027s not what knocks the wind out of my sails. It\u0027s the fact that I know her and last saw her a year ago in Slawter, frying the brains of a demon collaborator called Chuda Sool. \"Juni Swan!\" I cry. \"That\u0027s Miss Swan to you, young man,\" she says with a little smile. Then steps forward and wraps her arms around me, hugging me tight while I stand frozen, stunned, staring down at the top of her pale white orb of a head. Juni was one of film producer Davida Haym\u0027s assistants. A psychologist, it was her job to make sure the children on set were being well treated. Dervish fell for her and I think she had a thing for him too. I doubt the pair got beyond fond looks and holding hands, but I bet they would have if life hadn\u0027t gone crazy on us all. When hell hit the fan and the demons ran wild, Juni helped us break a hole through the barrier which Lord Loss had erected around the town. Without that gap, everyone would have perished. She was knocked out during the fighting and only recovered when the barrier had closed again, trapping hundreds of members of the cast and crew inside. Like the rest of us, she was helpless and had to stand by, watching and listening as the demons tortured and killed them. She lost herself to fury and found that like me she could tap into the magical energy in the air. In a fit of rage she used this power to kill Chuda Sool, a demon collaborator who\u0027d slipped through the gap. She regretted it afterwards. Snuck away in the night, leaving a note for Dervish saying she was confused and filled with sorrow. Said she might contact him one day if she sorted her head out, but not to expect to hear from her again. Now here she is, filling in for Misery Mauch, looking a bit more strained than when I previously knew her, but otherwise no different. \"Why are you here?\" I gasp once I\u0027ve recovered from my initial shock. \"How?\" \"That\u0027s what Billy asked,\" she chuckles. We\u0027re sitting in front of the desk, chairs close together. Juni\u0027s holding my hands. \"Aren\u0027t you pleased to see me?\" \"Of course. But it\u0027s been so long. I never thought... And how did you wind up here, in our school? You\u0027re not a school counsellor. Are you?\" \"Not precisely.\" She sighs and lets go of my hands. \"It\u0027s not a long story or particularly complicated. My head was in a mess after our experiences on the film set.\" She pauses. Her eyes make flickering contact with mine and I get the message-don\u0027t mention the demons or the slaughter. Please. \"It took me some months to recover,\" she continues, \"but not as long as I feared. I realised early on that work would help, that I needed to be busy, that by helping others with their problems, I could help myself too. \"A friend offered me a job involving school work. I became an advisor to a network of counsellors. I supervised them, provided them with guidelines, helped out with their problems, organised meetings and conferences. The school network I initially covered was far from here. Then, a couple of months ago, I was given an opportunity to relocate. I knew your school would be part of my new network. To be honest, that\u0027s largely what drew me to it.\" She smiles weakly. \"I\u0027ve been wanting to get in touch with Dervish since the day I ran off. I haven\u0027t because of fear, guilt, shame. This was a way to take a step closer. I meant to ease myself into his life, observe from a distance for a while, work up the courage to face him again. Then William Mauch fell ill at the very time you and Billy most needed a compassionate and understanding ear. As his superior I was expected to step in for him. As your friend I felt compelled to. So...\" She shrugs, embarrassed. \"Tah-dah!\" \"Dervish will be well pleased,\" I grin. \"He\u0027s missed you. Her face creases. \"Please don\u0027t tell him. Not yet. Not until I\u0027m ready.\" \"But-\" \"Please,\" she stops me, sharp this time. \"I\u0027ll see him soon, but not right now. Not until I\u0027ve had time to settle, get my bearings and finish what I came here to do.\" \"What do you mean?\" She leans forward, eyes warm but serious, and says, \"I want to talk about your friend, Loch Gossel.\" Puts a small, slim hand on one of my large, knobbly ones. \"I want to discuss his death and how that hurt you.\" We talk for almost an hour about my friendship with Loch, what he was like, how he died, what I felt, how I\u0027ve coped since then. I feel awkward at first, but Juni listens patiently, asks all the right questions, never pushy, always sensitive. She doesn\u0027t pretend we\u0027re not old friends, but at the same time she treats me like a patient, the way a professional should. No falseness, no charade, no smarm. I find myself opening up to her, telling her things I haven\u0027t even told Dervish, about my pain, my nightmares, my loss. We talk about Bill-E a lot. She spent most of the morning with him and she\u0027s worried. \"I can\u0027t tell you all that we discussed,\" she says. \"I have to respect his privacy. But I got the feeling there was animosity between him and Loch. Would you say that was an accurate assumption?\" \"They didn\u0027t get on,\" I admit. \"Did they ever fight?\" I smile. \"No.\" \"Why the smile?\" \"Loch was almost as big as me. A wrestler. It wouldn\u0027t have been much of a fight.\" \"But they argued?\" she presses. \"Loch...\" I hesitate, not wanting to say anything bad about my dead friend. \"He teased?\" Juni guesses. \"Yeah. He picked on Bill-E. Sometimes he was cruel. I didn\u0027t like that, but I couldn\u0027t do anything about it. It was Bill-E\u0027s problem, not mine.\" \"Was Loch teasing Billy on the day of his death?\" Juni asks. She\u0027s not afraid to talk about death openly. Doesn\u0027t hide behind softer terms like \u0027incident\u0027 or \u0027mishap\u0027. I like that. I think back. \"A little bit, yeah. But we were tired from di-I mean, from climbing in the quarry. We were all a bit snappish.\" \"They didn\u0027t fight?\" \"No.\" \"You didn\u0027t argue with Loch or try to stop him from teasing Billy?\" \"Not really.\" \"You\u0027re sure?\" I shrug. \"I don\u0027t remember everything that was said. The hour or two before he fell is kind of blank. I\u0027m not blocking it out. I just... it\u0027s like, when I look back, I\u0027m looking through a mist. Do you know what I mean?\" Juni nods. \"I know exactly what you mean. Part of my job will be to help you pierce that mist.\" \"Does it matter that much?\" I frown. \"Absolutely. It could be a mist of guilt. If you said something ugly to Loch which you now regret, you might have buried it. If you don\u0027t deal with that, it could lie within you for years, then work its way back to the surface, hurting you, making you feel horrible about yourself.\" \"Is that what you\u0027re doing with Bill-E?\" I ask. \"Piercing the mist?\" \"Yes. Although it will be harder with him than you. You\u0027re not the still-waters-run-deep type.\" \"Huh?\" \"You\u0027re honest and straight. What one sees is what one gets. Loch\u0027s death hurt but I don\u0027t think it struck you to the core like Billy. You\u0027re made of tougher stuff, Grubbs Grady. Tougher than Billy and tougher than me. I doubt we\u0027ll have any serious problems. You\u0027re too plain to be complex.\" \"You might be wrong,\" I mutter, annoyed at being described that way. \"Maybe I just do a good job of covering up my pain and confusion.\" \"Perhaps,\" Juni says. \"But don\u0027t worry, I make no rash assumptions. If you are suffering deep inside, I\u0027ll find out and help. You have my word on that.\" We talk a while longer about Loch\u0027s teasing and what I thought of it. Then a bit more about the day he died, how long I held him, my efforts to keep him alive, my feelings when I realised he was dead. I cry at that point. Juni makes no moves to comfort me, just sits, watching, waiting. When I recover, she hands me a tissue to wipe my cheeks dry, then moves on. At the end of the session she stands and shakes my hand. When I try to pull away, she grips tight, pink eyes seeking mine and holding them. \"Billy promised not to tell Dervish about me. If you can\u0027t make that promise or feel strange about it, please say so. I want to be the one to tell him I\u0027m here. I\u0027d rather do it later, when I\u0027m ready, but if you feel like I\u0027m putting you in an awkward situation, I\u0027ll do it now.\" \"No,\" I smile. \"I\u0027ll keep it quiet. He doesn\u0027t take much of an interest in school life. If he asks, I\u0027ll tell him some nutty dame replaced Misery Mauch. I bet he won\u0027t even ask for your name.\" \"Thank you.\" She releases me. \"We\u0027ll talk again tomorrow if you don\u0027t mind.\" \"I\u0027d like that.\" She smiles broadly, then ushers me out, leaving me to wander back to class, head buzzing, lips lifting at the edges, feeling for the first time since Loch\u0027s death that there might be a slight silver tinge to what previously seemed to be a bleak, black beast of a future.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-11.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
