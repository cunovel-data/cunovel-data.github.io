{"id":99694,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"For a couple of minutes I feel like a superhuman. Legs of steel, iron lungs, running faster than any normal person ever ran, obliterating records. Where are the Olympic judges when you need them?\\n\\n But then I slow. Pain sweeps through me. I stumble. The beast snarls. Writhing on the cold, hard forest floor. Sobbing. Trying to fight. I raise my head and try...\\n\\n Next thing I know, I\u0027m in the hole that leads to the cave, tugging at the crate which Dervish left there, ripping it to splinters, clambering down into the dark abyss. Part of me hesitates. Grateful to still be human, eager to reach the safety of the cave, happy to wait for Juni, but remembering Dervish\u0027s warning-this cave is dangerous, a place of evil magic. Perhaps I should...\\n\\n In the cave. I\u0027m howling, the howls echoing eerily. With an effort I make myself stop and the echoes die away. Then all I can hear is the waterfall and the super-fast beating of my over-worked heart.\\n\\n How long have I been unconscious, howling, the beast thinking it had won, only for me to somehow scrap my way back and regain control? Impossible to tell but it doesn\u0027t feel like a lot of time has passed.\\n\\n The dark is absolute. It scares me. The feeling of invulnerability and supremacy which drove me through the cordon of Lambs has passed. The magic\u0027s still there and so is the beast. But mostly it\u0027s just me now, human and cold, alone in the dark, thinking with horror how close I came to killing the three Lambs, hoping I didn\u0027t hurt them too much, wondering if I did the right thing by running.\\n\\n I slide to the floor and huddle my knees to my chest, clasping them tight, trying to see something-anything-through the darkness. Remembering Juni\u0027s kiss with confusion and shame, wondering what prompted it, or if I just imagined the adult passion. What I definitely didn\u0027t imagine-she said she\u0027d stand by me even if Dervish gave up. She set me free and promised to meet me here.\\n\\n It\u0027s wrong. Her intentions were good, but we shouldn\u0027t be doing this. I should have stayed and took what I had coming. Let Dervish handle the situation the way he thought best. He knows more about these matters than Juni or me. I\u0027ve passed a fatal point. Split from Dervish. Crossed swords with the Lambs. Made a pact with Juni that\u0027s cut me off from everybody else. What if she doesn\u0027t come? What if she changes her mind and leaves me here? What if...\\n\\n A light. I start to rise, thinking it\u0027s Juni. But then I see that it\u0027s coming from the wall of the cave, close to where the waterfall flows, just to the left of the crack I created in the rock. A strange, soft light, not of natural origin. It comes from within the wall. Circular but jagged round the rim. And in the centre, forcing its way out of the rock and into shape-the girl\u0027s face I saw when Loch died.\\n\\n The jaw, cheekbones and forehead bulge outwards, illuminated by the light. The face looks like a cross between rock and flesh, neither one nor the other but a splice of the two. When it\u0027s jutting out as far as it can-I can see the tips of its ears-the eyes open. A moment later the lips move.\\n\\n She speaks with urgency, words tripping off her tongue. I can tell it\u0027s important-her need to communicate something vital is clear-but I can\u0027t understand what she\u0027s saying. The language isn\u0027t like any I\u0027ve ever heard.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying,\" I moan, shaking my head helplessly. In response she raises her voice and speaks even quicker than before-as if that will help. \"I can\u0027t understand you!\" I shout, losing my temper.\\n\\n Then the pain hits again. The beast howls. Magic flares. I sink to my knees, moaning. The girl\u0027s voice rises. She yells, harassing me, repeating the same sharp phrases over and over. But I couldn\u0027t make sense of her words the first time and I can\u0027t make sense of them now. I want her to leave me alone.\\n\\n \"Stop,\" I groan, but she doesn\u0027t. \"Stop.\" Firmer this time, glaring at her, letting her see the anger in my eyes. I need peace and quiet if I\u0027m to fight the beast and drive it back into its den. Doesn\u0027t she realise how hard this is and that she\u0027s only making it harder?\\n\\n No, she doesn\u0027t. Or if she does, she doesn\u0027t care. She keeps on jabbering, voice rising, words coming faster and faster. Then a pair of hands grow out of the rock and she points at me accusingly, at the cave in general, at the crack in the rock.\\n\\n \"Shut up,\" I hiss, feeling the beast scrape the inside of my skull with its claws. \"I can\u0027t take anymore. Stop it. Stop it! STOP!\"\\n\\n With the final cry I lunge to my feet, throw my hands wide and scream.\\n\\n A sharp snapping sound-the crack beside the waterfall widens and lengthens. The girl\u0027s face and hands disappear. And the waterfall freezes. It turns to ice. A solid stretch of crystal from top to bottom, glistening beautifully, caught in full motion, an image no artist could ever hope to replicate.\\n\\n I stare at the ice, mesmerised. How the hell did I do that?\\n\\n Then the light where the girl\u0027s face was fades. I\u0027m plunged into darkness again. Moments later, while my head\u0027s still spinning, I notice the glow of another light behind me. I turn, expecting the face again. But this is the flickering of a torch. And it\u0027s coming from overhead, from the shaft to the forest above.\\n\\n \"Grubbs?\" someone calls-the most welcome voice in the world.\\n\\n \"Juni!\" I cry, stumbling towards the spot where she\u0027ll enter the cave. \"Come quick. You\u0027ll never believe-\"\\n\\n Agony. A flash of total torment. The beast, closer to the surface than ever. Incredibly powerful. The magic flares in response. The pair wrestle, spitting flames, fighting for possession of my body and soul.\\n\\n I collapse, screaming. Juni shouts my name again. The world dims around me. My thoughts go thin. I try to call and warn her to stay away. But it\u0027s too late. I go under. The beast drives me down. I vanish.\\n\\n Returning to my senses. Indescribable relief. When I felt myself lose control that last time, I thought I was finished. No more Grubbs Grady. Lost forever. Werewolf in command from this night till doomsday. It\u0027s good-delicious!-to be back.\\n\\n But relief fades as quickly as it swelled. I\u0027m no longer in the cave. I\u0027m in a house and there\u0027s blood everywhere. A couple of mauled, gutted bodies on the floor. Juni stands across from me, beaten and bruised, bleeding freely from her arms, head, neck. She\u0027s facing me, talking rapidly, hands outstretched and making frantic gestures, trying to calm me down.\\n\\n I\u0027m growling at her, my bloodstained fingers curled into fists, keeping her away from the corpses-apparently the beast wanted them all for himself.\\n\\n I manage to stop growling and lower my hands.\\n\\n \"Grubbs?\" Juni croaks nervously. \"Is that you?\"\\n\\n \"Uhrs.\" I cough. Clear my throat and try again. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Thank god,\" she weeps, collapsing. \"I thought you were going to kill me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d never...\" I stop and look around. I know this house. And now that I look past the layers of blood, I know the people.\\n\\n Ma and Pa Spleen!\\n\\n \"No!\" I cry. \"Not Bill-E! Tell me I didn\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"Behind you,\" Juni says through her tears.\\n\\n I turn slowly, expecting the worst, ready to rip my own heart out if I\u0027ve killed my brother. But he\u0027s alive. Lying on his stomach, unconscious, bleeding from a blow to his head. But his body\u0027s moving with his breath. I go to him quickly, turn him over on to his back, make him comfortable, check that the cut to his head isn\u0027t serious.\\n\\n \"You changed,\" Juni moans. \"I couldn\u0027t stop it. I thought I could tap into the magic of the cave and help. But you became a monster and tried to kill me. I managed to ward you off. Quenched the light. Hid in the darkness. Masked my smell using magic.\\n\\n \"Then you left. I tracked you here. You burst in before I arrived. Killed the old pair. You would have killed Billy too, but I fought and stalled you. I don\u0027t think I could have held you off much longer. If you hadn\u0027t turned back when you did...\"\\n\\n She breaks down. I stare at her, then at Bill-E. Then at the butchered Ma and Pa Spleen. I never liked them. They were cranky, selfish busybodies. Always interfering, trying to keep Bill-E and me apart. But they didn\u0027t deserve this-ripped to pieces in their own home by a savage animal of the night.\\n\\n \"What have I done?\" I cry, sinking to the floor, burying my head in my hands. \"I killed them. I\u0027m a murderer.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Juni sobs, crawling across, trying to prise my hands away. \"It was the beast... the werewolf. You didn\u0027t do this, Grubbs. It wasn\u0027t your fault.\"\\n\\n \"Of course it was!\" I scream, head shooting up. \"I knew what was happening. I knew I had to be locked up, what I could do if unleashed. I should have stayed in the cage and let the Lambs slaughter me.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say that,\" Juni pleads.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true,\" I cry. \"I should be dead now, not the Spleens. It should be...\" I stop, frowning. \"But why did I come here? Why pick on them and Bill-E?\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t like them,\" Juni reminds me.\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t hate them. And Bill-E\u0027s my best friend. Why...?\"\\n\\n \"Does it matter?\" she interrupts sharply. \"You were jealous of Billy, or you wanted to kill his grandparents, or the beast just came to somewhere it knew, to a familiar place it stole from your memories. It could have been your home, school, another friend\u0027s house. It happened to be here. What of it? Just be glad you regained consciousness before... before...\" She can\u0027t continue.\\n\\n I pat Juni\u0027s head as she cries. The tears have dried in my own eyes. I\u0027m staring at the dead bodies again, but calmly, detached, knowing what must be done.\\n\\n \"Phone Dervish,\" I tell Juni. \"Give him our position. Ask him to bring the Lambs. I won\u0027t fight. They can have me. I\u0027ll surrender.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Juni gasps. \"They\u0027ll kill you.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll exterminate me,\" I correct her. \"And that\u0027s what I need. This can\u0027t go on. I was wrong to run. I...\" A thought. \"Dervish doesn\u0027t know you helped me, does he?\"\\n\\n She shakes her head. \"I told him you broke out, that I tried to stop you but couldn\u0027t. He took off with the Lambs to track you down. I stayed behind, then sneaked out once they\u0027d gone. He doesn\u0027t know anything.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Forget about ringing him. I\u0027ll do it. Go home and clean yourself up. Say nothing about this to him. You don\u0027t have to be involved.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying.\"\\n\\n \"Yes I do. This has gone far enough. Too far. I killed tonight. Whether it was me or the beast doesn\u0027t matter. We both know that, if I carry on, I\u0027ll kill again. That can\u0027t happen. I won\u0027t allow it.\\n\\n So go. Thanks for everything, but I\u0027m past helping.\" I reach for my phone and start tapping in numbers.\\n\\n Juni gently takes the phone from me. \"Come away with me,\" she whispers. \"We\u0027ll go where nobody can find us, where you can\u0027t hurt anybody.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" I frown, trying to get the phone back.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll run,\" she hisses, holding the phone out of reach. She\u0027s stopped crying. Sounds more like her old self. I can imagine her brain whirring behind her eyes. \"Head for somewhere secluded and remote. When the next full moon comes, we\u0027ll go up a mountain or into a cave. I\u0027ll tie you up and sedate you with magic and drugs to make sure you can\u0027t kill anyone. I\u0027ll only set you free when the moon has passed. We\u0027ll stay in that place and carve out new lives for ourselves. Keep the world safe from you... from the beast.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re fantasising,\" I sigh. \"It wouldn\u0027t work. You saw what I did to the cage. I\u0027d escape and kill again.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she insists. \"I can control you. I\u0027m sure I can.\"\\n\\n \"And if I change forever the next time?\" I ask. \"If the beast takes over?\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll do what the Lambs tried to do tonight,\" she vows. Takes my hands and squeezes. \"Don\u0027t doubt my conviction. If I have to kill you, I will, regardless of how much that would hurt me. But I don\u0027t want to harm you if I don\u0027t have to. I still believe you can be saved. The werewolf should have taken you over tonight, but it didn\u0027t. You fought it and won. You can win again, I\u0027m sure you can. If I\u0027m wrong... if you lose...\" Her jaw goes firm. \"So be it. But we have to try. Life\u0027s too precious to throw away needlessly.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I look at the bodies again, at Bill-E. \"The risks...\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027ll be none,\" she promises, standing and pulling me up. \"We\u0027ll leave immediately and find a place where you can\u0027t hurt anyone.\"\\n\\n I hesitate, torn between knowing the right thing to do and wanting to live.\\n\\n \"If not for yourself,\" Juni says softly, \"do it for me. I love you, Grubbs. Please. Stay alive. For me.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what to say. I want to go with her. But the beast... the magic... the murders. I open my mouth, meaning to ask for the phone again, making up my mind to act bravely, selflessly, for the welfare of those I care about.\\n\\n But what comes out is a weak, \"OK. But you have to promise to keep me away from people. And, if necessary, you\u0027ll stop me the next time, any way you can.\"\\n\\n Juni crosses her heart and smiles. \"I promise.\" She goes to the back door and opens it, then pushes me ahead of her, out into the night. I stumble through the doorway meekly, silently cursing myself for my cowardice, head low, crying again. Once I\u0027m out, Juni quietly closes the door on the bloodshed and carnage, leaving Bill-E sleeping, to awaken later in the morning to horror and chaos. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-16.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \\n \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
