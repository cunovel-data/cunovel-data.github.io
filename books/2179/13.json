{"id":99691,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"It\u0027s official-Dervish Grady luvs Juni Swan! It\u0027s only been a week since she turned up at the mansion, but she\u0027s seen more of my uncle in that time than I\u0027ve seen of him in three months. She spent most of last weekend at our place, four of the nights since, and they\u0027re getting together this weekend too. They talk about magic a lot. Juni is able to channel magical energy when it\u0027s in the air around her. She tapped into her power in Slawter. She wanted to discuss it with Dervish and learn how to hone her talents, but she wasn\u0027t ready to face him. So she made enquiries, found others who are part of that magical underworld, and studied with them in her spare time while she was putting her professional life back together. She made rapid advances and has blossomed into a powerful mage over the past few months. Dervish has gone gaga over her. He was attracted to her in Slawter and thought of her a lot since then. But his feelings have gone haywire since she came back and he found out they had so much in common-most importantly, magic. He\u0027s so dazzled by her, it\u0027s unreal. I think if she asked him to get on his bike and ride to the other side of the world, he would. I\u0027m a bit dazed by it all. From being a vague friend and temporary school counsellor, Juni\u0027s become a central part of my life. I feel like a tornado has struck and nothing will ever be the same again. I was used to just having Dervish about the house. It got to feel natural. Now that\u0027s changed faster than I would have believed possible. I can\u0027t get my head around it. But I\u0027ll have to, because these two are just warming up. I came down for breakfast this morning and found Dervish and Juni already in the kitchen, kissing passionately, and I swear if he\u0027d had his tongue any further down her throat he\u0027d have been licking her lungs! Bill-E thinks the Dervish/Juni match is great. We\u0027ve been spending more time together since Loch\u0027s death, hanging out at lunch, having long chats like in the old days. I thought he might be jealous of all the time Juni spends with Dervish but he\u0027s not bothered. \"It\u0027s what Dervish needs,\" he contends. \"He\u0027s been alone too long.\" \"He had me,\" I huff. \"Hardly the same thing,\" Bill-E laughs. \"It\u0027ll be good for him. Maybe he\u0027ll get out more and stop moping about the place.\" \"Dervish doesn\u0027t mope.\" \"Yes he does,\" Bill-E insists. \"At least he did until Juni came along.\" Juni knows I\u0027ve been thrown by recent developments. She hasn\u0027t mentioned her relationship with Dervish or how her moving in might affect me. But she\u0027s asked several times, at home and in our sessions, if there\u0027s anything I want to talk about apart from Loch\u0027s death, if anything else is bothering me. Each time I\u0027ve said no and glanced away. She hasn\u0027t pressed. Giving me time. Leaving me alone until I\u0027m ready to discuss it with her willingly. In the middle of all the confusion, Reni starts back at school. I don\u0027t know what to say when we first come face to face. Apart from at the funeral, when we didn\u0027t speak, I haven\u0027t seen her since Loch\u0027s death. My first reaction-a huge bolt of guilt. I covered up the truth about the accident, helped move the body, lied to protect Dervish\u0027s secret. Several seconds of horrible silence. Then, \"Hi,\" Reni whispers. \"Hi,\" I croak. She leans towards me and rests her face on my chest. \"I miss him, Grubbs,\" she says, voice cracking. \"Me too,\" I moan. Floods of tears. Both of us. It\u0027s easier after that. Not the same as before-it never will be-but it\u0027s OK, especially when we\u0027re with the others. Now everyone talks openly about Loch, the accident, how hard it\u0027s been, not shying away from the subject. We have Juni to thank for that. She\u0027s had all of us in her office-or visited us at home-since she came, working doggedly to help us talk about and deal with our grief. Life for us would be a hell of a lot harder without her. \"What are you doing this weekend?\" Shannon asks Reni on Friday. \"Nothing much,\" Reni says. \"Staying in. Studying. I have a lot to catch up on.\" \"Scratch that,\" Shannon snorts. \"You\u0027re coming to the cinema with the rest of us. I won\u0027t take no for an answer. Grubbs, you\u0027re coming too.\" \"Yes, boss,\" I grin, glad for an excuse to get out of the house-Juni\u0027s not very big, but the place feels crowded when she\u0027s about. \"How will we get there?\" Reni asks. There\u0027s a small cinema in the Vale but we hardly ever go to it. Much more fun going to a multiplex in one of the bigger towns nearby. \"Frank\u0027s Dad will take us,\" Shannon says. Frank\u0027s father is a taxi driver and owns a people carrier. \"Won\u0027t he, Frank?\" Shannon flutters her eyelids at him, buttering him up. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do,\" Frank mutters. \"Can Bill-E come?\" I ask, eager to involve him. \"Sure,\" Shannon says after a moment\u0027s hesitation. \"The more the merrier.\" The gang\u0027s been kind about Bill-E since the accident. They don\u0027t mind me including him in our lunch-time chats and after-school activities. But I can feel the mood shifting back to the way it used to be. Bill-E\u0027s not one of us, and though he was temporarily accepted due to the exceptional circumstances, the natural order of the school world must soon be resumed. The day\u0027s fast arriving when I\u0027ll have to make a choice-Bill-E or the others. But that\u0027s a bridge to cross another time. This weekend\u0027s about friends, films and fun. The more serious stuff can wait. Dervish and Juni spend the night practising magic. It seems that Juni has quite a gift. She\u0027s learnt a lot over the last several months and can run rings around many of my uncle\u0027s spells. \"Have you asked her to join the Disciples?\" I enquired earlier this evening, half joking, half serious. \"You could head off on demon-bashing weekends together, maybe check out some punk concerts at the same time.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Dervish muttered, not picking up on the joke. \"I really don\u0027t want to involve her. That life\u0027s so dangerous. But I can\u0027t stand by and let such power go to waste. We need all the mages we can get. And I think she\u0027ll want to join. That might even be why she came looking for me-personal feelings aside, she\u0027s seen the Demonata in action, and learnt about the Disciples when they came to Slawter to clear up. She knows what the world\u0027s up against, the war that\u0027s being fought. Maybe she wants to help. I\u0027ll have to broach the subject soon but I\u0027m not looking forward to it.\" As wrapped up as he is with Juni, Dervish hasn\u0027t forgotten about me. He still checks on me most nights, monitoring me, quizzing me about what I\u0027m feeling, worried about what might lie ahead. We\u0027re halfway through the lunar month. I\u0027m just a couple of weeks away from the madness again. Dervish isn\u0027t treating it lightly. For all the time he\u0027s spent with Juni, and all the excitement and hope he\u0027s experiencing, he hasn\u0027t neglected his obligations to me. He\u0027s been in contact with everyone he can think of, trying to find out more about my situation, if anyone\u0027s heard of anything like it before. Working hard for my benefit. He hasn\u0027t mentioned the Lambs, but I\u0027m sure he\u0027s thinking about them, just as I am every night, unable to turn away from the thoughts of what must be done if the beast emerges and I change. Heading out to the cinema. I stick my head into the study, to let Dervish and Juni know I\u0027m going. They\u0027re sitting together on the floor, facing one another, fingers joined, eyes closed, breathing deeply. Working on a spell. They don\u0027t hear me when I call. I walk in and scribble a note. As I\u0027m sticking it to the front of Dervish\u0027s PC, my glance slides to where Juni\u0027s sitting. I can see her eyes glowing behind her lids. She looks creepy. I exit quickly and race down the stairs, not sure what it was that freaked me so much, only knowing that I\u0027m glad to be putting some space between us. Eating in a 1950s style hamburger restaurant before the movie. Everyone excited and buzzing, except me. I keep thinking about Juni\u0027s eyes, trying to pinpoint what it was about them that unnerved me. Bill-E\u0027s excited to be with us, though he finds it hard to join in all the talk. He\u0027ll start to say something, then stop and think about the best way to phrase it. By the time he has the words straight inside his head, the topic\u0027s changed. If he\u0027d just be himself he\u0027d be fine. But he thinks he has to be extra witty and cool around us, and by worrying and hesitating, he comes across as dumb and stumbling. I think about saying something to him, but then I fall to thinking about Juni\u0027s eyes again. Reni sits beside me for the film. After a while she takes my hand. I half-turn to smile at her and she smiles back. I thought Loch\u0027s death might drive a wedge between us, but it hasn\u0027t. She still wants to be my girlfriend. Maybe it\u0027s even more important to her now than it was before-the more she focuses on me, the less she\u0027ll brood about Loch. I start to lean over, mouth dry, spinal cord tingling. But then I think of Juni\u0027s eyes again and it finally clicks. The glow reminded me of the fiery, eyeless sockets of one of Lord Loss\u0027s familiars-the charmless hell-baby known as Artery. I draw away from Reni. She stares at me, surprised and slightly hurt. I force a bitter smile. \"Later,\" I whisper. \"I\u0027m nervous, you know?\" Letting her think I\u0027ve gone shy. Unable to tell her that thoughts of demons have set my teeth trembling, that I\u0027m afraid I might accidentally bite her tongue if we kiss. Reni smiles back and gives my hand a squeeze. \"I know,\" she says, finding it sweet. She leans her head on my shoulder and sighs. \"When you\u0027re ready, give me a shout. I can wait.\" I lay my head on hers and close my eyes, drowning out the sounds of the film, trying to listen to her heartbeat, feeling her hair soft against my cheek-but not able to stop thinking about Juni\u0027s eyes and demons. As we come out of the cinema I spot a tramp sitting by the side of one of the mall\u0027s fountains. We\u0027re a long way off but he looks like the same one I ran into on the path home last week. As the others file to the restaurant again, for milkshakes, I halt and fix my gaze on the tramp. I\u0027m certain it\u0027s him-same shaggy beard, long hair, old clothes, posy of flowers in a buttonhole. And maybe it\u0027s my imagination, but he seems to be looking back at me, returning my stare. I start towards him, not entirely sure why, but bothered by his being here, wanting to make sure it\u0027s the same man. Then Reni notices I\u0027m not with the group. She calls my name. When I don\u0027t respond, she calls again, sharply. \"Sorry,\" I mutter, taking my eyes off the tramp. \"Thought I saw someone I knew.\" \"Who?\" Reni asks. \"Nobody.\" I smile when she frowns at me. \"A teacher. But it wasn\u0027t. Come on, let\u0027s go tuck into our shakes.\" \"You\u0027re in a strange mood tonight,\" Reni comments, towing me along to catch up with the others. Just before we turn the corner, I look back at the fountain. But nobody\u0027s there now. The tramp has gone. Home. Troubled. Thinking about the tramp. Probably nothing, just coincidence that I\u0027ve seen him a couple of times. But it might be something more. We\u0027re protected here from demons, Dervish has said it dozens of times. But some demons have human assistants. What if the tramp is working for Lord Loss, waiting for the chance to knock me out and cart me away to a spot where the demon master can set his evil hands on me? I decide to tell Dervish. I might wind up looking like a frightened fool, jumping at shadows, but it\u0027s best not to take chances with stuff like this. I go searching for Dervish in his study, then his bedroom, but I only find Juni, sitting on the edge of Dervish\u0027s bed, staring out the window, pensive. \"Hi,\" I say. \"Is Dervish about?\" \"He\u0027s gone for Chinese.\" \"Oh.\" The local Chinese takeaway does home deliveries but Dervish doesn\u0027t trust them to send the correct food. He always fetches it himself. \"No worries. I\u0027ll catch him when he\u0027s back.\" I start to leave. \"Grubbs,\" Juni stops me. She pats the space on the bed next to her. There\u0027s a long silence as I settle beside her. She continues to stare out the window. She\u0027s so slender, I feel even bigger than normal sitting next to her. \"I saw you earlier, in the study,\" Juni says. \"How?\" I frown. \"Your eyes were closed.\" \"I could see through the lids-part of the spell. You looked scared. You ran away as if I frightened you.\" I fidget uncomfortably. \"Are you afraid that Dervish is falling in love with me? That I\u0027m going to steal his love for you?\" \"No,\" I laugh. \"That wasn\u0027t it at all.\" \"Then why did you look so spooked?\" \"Your eyes.\" I clear my throat. \"They were like a demon\u0027s that I fought.\" Juni tenses when I mention the D word. Then relaxes. \"We haven\u0027t talked much about that, have we?\" she notes softly. \"No.\" \"I\u0027m still haunted by what happened,\" she whispers. \"I\u0027m dealing with it, but it\u0027s hard. Knowing there are demons in the world... or tearing at the edges of it... wanting to grab us and destroy...\" \"I know exactly how you feel. I hate them too. They terrify me.\" I blush at the confession. \"That\u0027s why I ran. I didn\u0027t realise it till later, but your eyes reminded me of a demon\u0027s. I panicked. It was silly, but...\" I shrug. \"You think I have a demon\u0027s eyes?\" Juni asks, bemused. \"No,\" I chuckle. \"It was just magic. Dervish told me magic comes from demons, that the energy we tap into has seeped through from the Demonata\u0027s universe. Every time we cast a spell, we use a bit of demonic energy. I guess it makes us look like them sometimes. This was just the first time I noticed it.\" Juni nods, understanding. Then, out of nowhere, she says, \"Dervish is going to ask me to move in.\" \"Oh?\" I blink. \"I don\u0027t know if I should.\" She looks worried. \"This has taken me by complete surprise. Maybe I need to slow things down. Stay away for a while. Give us all some space and time.\" I stare at her clumsily. I can\u0027t think of anything to say. I know nothing about stuff like this. After a few seconds, Juni laughs and lays a hand on my knee. \"Sorry. I don\u0027t expect you to decide for me. I just needed to say it out loud.\" \"I... I think... I mean... Dervish likes you. Really likes you. I... I think you should say yes.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t mind?\" she asks softly. \"No.\" \"You\u0027re sure?\" Her fingers tighten on my knee. \"Since I got involved with Dervish, I\u0027ve noticed a change in your response to me. I wasn\u0027t sure you approved of our relationship. I thought you didn\u0027t like me, that you didn\u0027t want me to-\" \"No,\" I interrupt. \"That\u0027s crazy. I... No.\" Smiling now. \"It\u0027s been strange, having you here, but I\u0027m not against it. Honest. I\u0027d like it if you moved in.\" Juni smiles blazingly. \"You don\u0027t know how glad I am to hear that.\" She leans over and kisses my cheek. My blush darkens and spreads. She tweaks my nose, then gets up. \"Come on,\" she says, heading for the door. \"Dervish will be back soon. We ordered extra in case you wanted any. You can help me prepare some plates.\" Following her down the stairs, grinning to myself, delighted to find that I truly don\u0027t mind if she comes to live with us. Figuring crowded might not be such a bad thing for this hollow old house. Late Sunday. Juni was right. Dervish asked her last night if she\u0027d come live with us. She agreed, but said it would have to be for a trial period. They\u0027ll see how they get on and if things don\u0027t work, she\u0027ll move out again. She made the big switch today. Didn\u0027t have much to bring. She\u0027s moved around a lot this year, living out of a suitcase. She had a house once, but sold it when she accepted the movie job with Davida Haym. She\u0027s been living in hotels since then. Says she has bits and bobs in storage, which she can fetch later, but there\u0027s no urgency. Dervish is like a child at Christmas. When Juni left to check out of her hotel this morning, he spent the time polishing and cleaning, making sure everything would be shiny and perfect when she returned. He\u0027s been dancing around the house like a pantomime fairy, whistling, sometimes singing out loud. Give me strength! They\u0027re in bed now. It\u0027s nearly two in the morning. They\u0027ve probably been asleep for hours, but I can\u0027t nod off. Worrying about lycanthropy. Magic. Juni moving in and how that\u0027s going to change things. Loch. Reni. The tramp. (I forgot to tell Dervish about him.) I get up and dress. Pad downstairs and let myself out. Start walking, then jogging. Soon I\u0027m running, breathing hard, breath turning to mist on the cool night air. I develop a stitch. Ignoring it, I run until it feels as if my stomach is on fire. Finally I stop and bend over, panting like a thirsty dog. When I can breathe normally I set off again, but only jogging this time, pacing myself. It\u0027s hard to jog at night. The forest is dark around me. Have to be careful where I put my feet. But I\u0027m not afraid. The sounds and smells of the night don\u0027t scare me. I\u0027m safe here, on home turf. I jog without direction, simply enjoying the exercise. Letting my feet guide me. Not keeping track of my route, confident I can find my way back. Then I round a patch of briars and spot scatterings of rocks and earth-I\u0027m at the entrance to the cave. I stop and squint suspiciously. Dervish hasn\u0027t had time to fill in the hole. He stuck a crate down it and covered it with soil and small stones so nobody would fall down into the cave, but that\u0027s as far as he got. I approach the hole cautiously, wondering if I\u0027ve been drawn here by some external force or if it\u0027s just coincidence. I listen closely for whispers but I can\u0027t hear anything. Can\u0027t sense anything either-no magical warmth within, or feeling that I\u0027m being summoned. I stop at the edge of the hole and stare down into darkness, thinking about Loch. It seems so long ago that we were messing about here, dreaming of Lord Sheftree\u0027s buried treasure. Everything was simple then. You don\u0027t recognise the good times in life until it all goes bad and you look back and see how lucky you were, how easy you had things. I wonder where Loch is now, if there\u0027s an afterlife, what it\u0027s like if there is. Is he sitting on a cloud, plucking at the strings of a harp? Wrestling with angels? Being waited upon by beautiful women? Does he know the answers to all the questions in the universe? Has he come back as somebody else or as an animal? Or is there nothing when you die? I know people have souls, but do they vanish into oblivion when the body shuts down? Is life the start and finish of all that we are? Is Loch- \"You\u0027re out late.\" A voice behind me. I whirl and spot the tramp, half-hidden by shadows, watching me with a little smile that\u0027s hard to distinguish behind the tangled bush of his beard. \"Who are you?\" I shout. \"Why are you following me? The tramp steps forward and I get my first good look at him. Dark skin, but I think the colour\u0027s more to do with dirt than flesh pigment. Black hair streaked with patches of grey and white. Small build. Cracked fingernails, but not caked with dirt as you\u0027d expect-clean as a surgeon\u0027s. Small eyes, blue or grey. \"You should be asleep,\" the tramp says. A deep voice. Hard to place the accent. \"Who are you?\" I growl again, looking for something to defend myself with. The tramp walks past me to the edge of the hole. Stares down, the same way I was staring moments before. \"A grave fit for a king,\" he murmurs, then looks at me and smiles crookedly. \"Have anyone in mind for it?\" \"Who are you?\" I ask for the third time but my voice is trembling now. This is no ordinary tramp. There\u0027s something powerful and dangerous about him. The tramp doesn\u0027t answer my question. Instead he looks up at the sky-at the moon. \"Won\u0027t be long now,\" he says casually, then skirts the hole and walks off, not looking back, disappearing into the cover of the forest within seconds. I stay where I am for a minute, shivering. Then bolt for home, to wake Dervish-the hell with his beauty sleep-and tell him about the mysterious, ominous stranger. Almost back at the mansion, ready to scream myself hoarse about the tramp, when I slow, frown and pause. Maybe Dervish already knows. The tramp knew who I was. I\u0027m pretty sure he knew about the cave too and what happened there. And he definitely knew about the moon and what it\u0027s doing to me-that was clear by his mocking tone. If he was a servant of Lord Loss, that would have been the perfect place to ambush me. I was alone. I didn\u0027t know he was there until he spoke. He could have clubbed me over the head or injected me with a sleeping drug. But he didn\u0027t. So I doubt he\u0027s in league with the demon master. If that\u0027s the case, he could only have known all those things if he\u0027d been told. And Dervish is the only one who could have told him. Flashback. Dervish\u0027s study... him on the phone... checking afterwards... finding the black folder with the numbers and names. Figuring-the tramp must be one of the Lambs. A scout, sent to keep an eye on me. Dervish promised to summon a magician to help, but instead he called in the Lambs, to be safe, in case I turn and he can\u0027t handle me alone. The tramp has been shadowing me ever since, ready to move quickly if needs dictate. I enter the house and creep up the stairs. I don\u0027t wake Dervish or ask him about the tramp. Just undress and crawl into bed. Cold. Stiff. Terrified. Alone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-13.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
