For a long minute he doesn\u0027t even glance at where I\u0027m hunched over Loch. His attention is fixed on the walls, the roof, the formations, the waterfall. Then Bill-E nudges him softly and mumbles, \"Over there.\"\n Dervish snaps to his senses and advances. \"Billy told me what happened,\" he says, still several metres away. \"How is he?\"\n \"Fine-\" I say and Dervish smiles \"-for a dead man.\" The smile vanishes. He slows. Behind him, Bill-E covers his mouth with his hands, stifling a sob or a scream.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\" Dervish asks softly.\n \"Check for yourself,\" I say hollowly. \"Prove me wrong.\" My face crinkles. \"Please.\"\n Dervish kneels and gently pushes me away. He examines Loch. Rolls his eyelids up. Puts his ear to the dead wrestler\u0027s chest. Goes through all the same resuscitation tricks that I tried. I don\u0027t bother telling him that he\u0027s wasting his time. Let him find out for himself.\n Eventually he draws back, saddened-but worried too. He looks at me. Then at Bill-E. \"Tell me again what happened.\"\n \"He slipped,\" Bill-E moans. \"I tried to grab him but I couldn\u0027t reach.\"\n \"There was nobody else in the cave?\" Dervish presses sharply. He looks at me and licks his lips. \"Nothing else?\"\n \"No,\" Bill-E cries.\n \"No,\" I whisper.\n \"You\u0027re sure?\" Dervish asks, voice low, directing the question just to me this time. \"It\u0027s important. You were alone? The three of you? You\u0027re sure?\"\n I nod slowly, confused.\n \"I tried to save him,\" Bill-E sobs. \"But he was too big. Even if I\u0027d caught him, he\u0027d have dragged me down with him, isn\u0027t that right, Grubbs? It wasn\u0027t my fault. Please, Dervish, don\u0027t say it was my fault.\"\n \"Of course it wasn\u0027t,\" Dervish sighs. \"It was an accident.\" He rubs his chin, troubled. He stands, looks around, glances at the waterfall and the spot Loch fell from. Doesn\u0027t mention the crack-he hadn\u0027t seen the wall before I howled and split the rock so he assumes it\u0027s a natural feature.\n \"Is there anything you can do?\" I ask. \"Any spells...?\"\n \"No,\" Dervish says plainly. \"He\u0027s beyond help.\"\n I fight back tears. \"Will the ambulance be here soon? Maybe they-\"\n \"Nobody can do anything!\" Dervish snaps. \"He\u0027s dead. You\u0027ve seen death before. Don\u0027t ask the impossible. You\u0027re not a child.\"\n I stare at my uncle, stunned by his harsh tone. It sounds like he\u0027s criticising me for caring about my friend, as though that\u0027s wrong.\n Dervish catches my look and his expression softens. \"This is bad. And not just because Loch is dead.\" He looks around again, nervously. \"I didn\u0027t call for an ambulance.\"\n \"What?\" I explode. \"But-\"\n \"He\u0027s dead,\" Dervish says as if that explains everything. \"An ambulance wouldn\u0027t have helped.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t know that when you came,\" I shout. \"When Bill-E fetched you, Loch was alive. Why didn\u0027t you phone for help? Maybe they could have got here before you. Maybe Loch would be alive if-\"\n \"Billy, come here,\" Dervish interrupts me. Bill-E approaches slowly, fearfully, trying not to look at Loch. Dervish keeps me silent with a fierce frown. I want to scream bloody murder, but I bite my tongue, waiting to hear my uncle out. When Bill-E\u0027s a metre or so away from us-the closest he\u0027s going to come-Dervish speaks.\n \"What happened tonight is a tragedy. I feel for you, honestly, even though I\u0027m not showing it. We\u0027ll talk about this after. I\u0027ll give you all the support I can, make it as easy for you as possible. But right now I have to be hard. And I have to ask something hard of you.\"\n He pauses. Again a nervous glance around. \"As far as the official verdict goes, Loch can\u0027t have died here,\" Dervish says. \"I\u0027ll explain later. Right now you have to trust me. We need to move the body. Make it look like this happened somewhere else. Cover up the entrance to the cave and tell nobody about it. Understand?\"\n Bill-E and I gawp at him.\n \"Please,\" Dervish says. \"I wouldn\u0027t ask if it wasn\u0027t crucial.\"\n \"You want to... tamper... with the body?\" Bill-E croaks.\n \"I just want to move it,\" Dervish says. \"We\u0027ll take it to the quarry. You can say you were climbing there. We\u0027ll call the emergency services once we-\"\n \"Bloody hell, Dervish!\" I yell. \"Loch is dead and you\u0027re playing games? What sort of heartless-\"\n \"You\u0027re not listening!\" Dervish roars, losing his temper. He glares at me. \"Let me say it again- this is crucial. This cave has been hidden for hundreds of years for a very good reason. It must be hidden again.\"\n \"Hidden?\" I whisper and Dervish nods. \"You mean you knew about it?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know the exact location but I knew it existed.\" Dervish is white-lipped. \"The entrance was deliberately blocked off many centuries ago. We\u0027ll have to fill it in again.\" He stands and offers his left hand to me, his right to Bill-E. I don\u0027t want to take it but his eyes tell me I must. Bill-E is even slower to accept the hand but eventually he takes it too.\n \"You\u0027ve got to promise,\" Dervish says. \"Promise you\u0027ll back me up, lie for me, say this happened in the quarry, tell nobody about the cave. On all that\u0027s holy to you... in the name of your dead mothers... promise.\"\n \"And if we don\u0027t?\" I ask stiffly.\n Dervish smiles bitterly. \"I could force you but I won\u0027t.\" He squeezes our hands tightly. \"You both know that we live in a world that\u0027s not the exclusive domain of humans. There are other forces. Demonic forces. This cave could be valuable to them. If we don\u0027t handle this right, demons will benefit and Loch won\u0027t be the only one who dies. Will you promise?\"\n Neither of us says anything.\n Dervish sighs wearily. \"I\u0027ll tell you more about it later. You can retract your promise then, if you feel I didn\u0027t have good reason to ask for it. But there isn\u0027t time now. We have to work quickly, get Loch to the quarry and phone for the police straightaway. If we delay, it will show on an autopsy. It\u0027ll be risky, no matter how we play it, but if we don\u0027t act now, while we have the advantage of time, it will be a lot harder. For all of us.\"\n Bill-E and I share a look. Neither of us knows what this is about but we trust Dervish. He\u0027s saved both our lives in the past.\n \"You swear you\u0027ll explain?\" I ask, voice shaking hoarsely.\n \"I swear.\"\n \"Then I promise.\"\n Dervish smiles gratefully and looks to Bill-E.\n \"OK,\" Bill-E says weakly.\n \"In the name of your mother?\" Dervish presses, hearing a wavering tone in Bill-E\u0027s promise.\n Bill-E hesitates, then nods. \"In the name of my mother.\"\n Dervish relaxes and lets go of our hands. \"Thank you. This is more important than either of you can possibly realise. It\u0027s...\" He looks down at Loch and gulps, then mutters under his breath, \"At least there wasn\u0027t any blood.\"\n That reminds me about the mysterious disappearance of Loch\u0027s blood. I start to tell Dervish about it... then stop. It isn\u0027t important. The blood must have simply seeped through cracks in the ground. I\u0027ll only confuse the situation if I speak up now.\n Dervish bends beside the body, gently touches Loch\u0027s pale forehead, then sighs and tugs at his beard. A moment\u0027s pause, during which I see how hard he\u0027s having to work to cover up his true feelings. Then his expression firms and he moves into professional mode. \"Billy, you bring the torches. I\u0027ll take the shoulders. Grubbs, grab his legs. And for hell\u0027s sake, don\u0027t drop him-that\u0027s the last thing we need.\"\n The next few hours are nightmarish. We carry the body home, load it on to the back of Dervish\u0027s motorbike, strap the arms around Dervish and put a helmet on so if anybody sees Loch it\u0027ll look like he\u0027s a living passenger. I watch them drive away, shivering next to Bill-E, then go indoors and try to drink a mug of hot chocolate in the kitchen. But I\u0027m unable to gulp it down.\n Dervish comes back for us. Usually he\u0027d only allow one of us to ride behind him, but there\u0027s no time to follow the rules of the road. At the quarry, Dervish throws Loch over the uppermost edge of the cliff. The dull thump as he collides with the hard floor brings tears from Bill-E and me. I don\u0027t know why Dervish didn\u0027t chuck Loch down when he brought him out here. Maybe he wasn\u0027t thinking straight. Or maybe he wanted our tears, to make the rest of the charade seem more realistic.\n I make a phone call. Following Dervish\u0027s instructions, I dial the emergency number, report the accident breathlessly, give my details and wait. I wonder why Bill-E and I didn\u0027t do that before. We both have mobiles. Why didn\u0027t one of us climb out of the cave and ring for an ambulance? Did we simply lose our heads and panic? Or did something in the cave control our actions?\n The police arrive before the ambulance. Dervish debated whether or not he should stay with us or go home and return after the emergency services got here. In the end he chose to stay, instructing us to tell them that we rang him after calling for help. Everybody here knows Dervish. They know how fast he goes on his bike. The police are always trying to catch him but he\u0027s too crafty. They\u0027ll assume he tore over here at top speed. They won\u0027t like it, but given the tragic circumstances, they\u0027re hardly going to make a fuss.\n Paramedics examine Loch. They do what they can to bring him back to life. But they go about their job sluggishly, without hope, knowing it\u0027s too late. They don\u0027t cover his face before loading him into the back of the ambulance because they don\u0027t want to upset Bill-E and me. But as soon as he\u0027s out of our sight, I\u0027m certain the sheet will be pulled up and over.\n The officer in charge asks to take our statements. Dervish clears his throat and gently suggests phoning Loch\u0027s parents first. The officer blushes-he\u0027s young, probably hasn\u0027t seen a corpse before, temporarily forgot his training. Dervish offers to make the phone call. The officer accepts the offer with a grateful smile.\n Dervish keeps it quick and to the point. There\u0027s been an accident. Loch\u0027s been taken to hospital. Says it\u0027s serious. Doesn\u0027t say Loch\u0027s dead. Leaves that for the doctors. Not the sort of news you should break over the phone.\n Home. The police drive Bill-E and me. Dervish follows on his bike. More hot chocolate. I still can\u0027t drink it. Biscuits which I can\u0027t eat. Dervish turns on the heating. While the police are talking with us, Dervish rings Ma and Pa Spleen. They arrive before we\u0027re finished, splashing out on a taxi for maybe the first time in their lives. Anxious to protect their grandson. Eager to whip him away from the police and their questions. Dervish has to drag them aside and explain that it will be easier if they let the police finish-if we don\u0027t do it here, we\u0027ll have to go to the police station later. He takes them into the kitchen and plies them with tea and coffee. I imagine them discussing me, Ma and Pa Spleen blaming me for Bill-E being in the quarry after dark, saying I\u0027m responsible for him risking his life on such a dangerous climb-and for Loch\u0027s death.\n The interrogation goes softly. The police don\u0027t suspect foul play. They just want to get the facts straight. We tell them we went for a walk. Wound up at the quarry. Went climbing. Loch fell. Bill-E tried to catch him. Couldn\u0027t. The end.\n Kids fool around at the quarry all the time. Every few years some local official vows to block it off. Nobody\u0027s ever followed up on the promise, though I think they will after this. The police take the attitude that a fatality was bound to happen sooner or later. Just bad luck that it happened to us.\n They leave not long after midnight. (How did it get so late so quick?) They say they might return to take follow-up statements, but that shouldn\u0027t be necessary. They tell us to take a few days off school, maybe go away for a while. They warn of a possible backlash-parents sometimes overreact in situations like this. Loch\u0027s relatives might blame Bill-E and me, hurl insults and accusations at us. The police say we shouldn\u0027t be too upset if that happens, to try and understand their position.\n Bill-E wants to stay the night, hear Dervish out, learn why we had to lie. But Ma and Pa Spleen are having none of it. They want out and fast. They\u0027ve never liked Dervish and aren\u0027t a lot fonder of me. Bill-E\u0027s arguments are shot down before they\u0027re out of his mouth. Then it\u0027s into the back of the taxi which they\u0027ve kept waiting and home, where they can pour poison in his ear and remind him of all the times they warned him about the grisly Gradys, how we\u0027d lead him astray.\n Then it\u0027s just me and my uncle, alone in our old mansion. A foul smell in the air-the stench of lies and deception.\n Without discussing it, we retire upstairs to Dervish\u0027s study, where we sit on opposite sides of his huge desk, facing each other, me suspicious and wiping away tears, Dervish ashamed and tweaking the hairs of his beard.\n Time for explanations. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/blood-beast-the-demonata-5/page-9.html","bookId":2179,"book":{"id":2179,"title":"Blood Beast (The Demonata #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Blood Beast (The Demonata #5) \n \"Locked inside Dervish\u0027s study.
