{"id":109341,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Kiyo was gone the next morning, as I\u0027d suspected he would be. We\u0027d stumbled inside to my little-used bedroom once it started raining, and his side of the bed was cold, telling me he\u0027d left some time ago. I sighed, trying not to let the knowledge of him being with Maiwenn get me down, and headed out to see what was going on in Queen Eugenie\u0027s domain. The first thing I picked up on was that everyone was really excited that it had rained. We\u0027d returned to normal sunny conditions this morning, but last night\u0027s rain had brought the land to life. Cacti bloomed. The trees seemed stronger. And while there were no ostensible signs of excess water, I could sense it in the ground and even slightly in the air. Had having sex caused it? Maybe. Maybe not. Regardless, I was pleased with my good deed. I made motions to leave, but Rurik stopped me. \"Don\u0027t you want to question the prisoners?\" I paused. What I wanted was to go home, shower, and change into clean clothes. \"Can\u0027t you do that?\" I asked. He frowned. \"Well, certainly, but...\" But it should be my job. That was the unspoken message. I suspected Aeson would have never done such a thing. He would have left it to thugs. I knew if I delegated it to Rurik, he\u0027d do it without (much) complaint. There was something in his eyes, though, that told me he expected more of me than an ordinary monarch. I\u0027d never expected to gain such regard from him-or to feel so uneasy about it. Rurik had pissed me off to no end in the past, but suddenly, I didn\u0027t want to disappoint him. \"Okay,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s do it.\" I\u0027d interrogated plenty of monsters, gentry, and even humans in my day. But there was something weird about interrogating prisoners. It was strange enough to learn that I actually had a dungeon in the castle. There were even shackles on the wall, but thankfully, our two prisoners weren\u0027t bound. They were a man and a woman, both ragged and sullen. He looked my age; she looked older. I entered the bronze-barred cell, Rurik and another guard behind me. I crossed my arms over my chest and swallowed my misgivings. I was Eugenie Markham, badass shaman and slayer of Otherworldly miscreants. This was no different from any of my other jobs. \"Okay,\" I told the prisoners, my voice harsh. \"We can make this easy or hard. Answer my questions, and it\u0027ll go a lot faster and smoother for all of us.\" The woman glared at me. \"We don\u0027t answer to you.\" \"That\u0027s the funny thing,\" I said. \"You do. You\u0027re in my land. You\u0027re under my rule, my jurisdiction.\" She spat on the ground. \"You\u0027re a usurper. You stole the land from Aeson.\" Considering the way power was always shifting in the Otherworld, I found that statement ludicrous. \"Everyone\u0027s a usurper here. And in case you haven\u0027t heard, I didn\u0027t steal the land from him so much as blow him up.\" Her face remained hard, but I saw the slightest flicker of fear in the guy\u0027s face. I turned to him. \"What about you? You going to be reasonable? Are you going to tell me where the girls you kidnapped are?\" He nervously glanced at his companion. She gave him a hard look, its message easily interpretable: Don\u0027t talk. I sighed. I didn\u0027t want to resort to torture. All-powerful ruler or not, it was just an ugly thing I didn\u0027t want to dirty my hands with. I had a feeling my iron athame pointed at their throats would go a long way to get them to communicate. Instead, I opted for another solution. Producing my wand, I stepped away from the others and spoke the words to summon Volusian. The momentary cold descended upon us, and then the spirit stood before me. Rurik and the guard were growing accustomed to this, but the prisoners gasped. \"Volusian,\" I said. \"Got a task for you.\" \"As my mistress commands.\" I gestured to the prisoners. \"I need you to put muscle on them. Get them to talk.\" Volusian\u0027s red eyes widened slightly, the closest he ever came to looking happy. \"But you can\u0027t kill them,\" I added hastily. \"Or hurt them-much.\" The pseudo-happiness disappeared. \"Start with the guy,\" I said. Volusian sidled across the cell and was only reaching his hand out when the guy cracked. \"Alright! Alright! I\u0027ll talk,\" he cried. \"Stop, Volusian.\" The spirit stepped back, his glum expression growing. \"I don\u0027t know anything about girls disappearing,\" the man said. \"We aren\u0027t taking them.\" \"You\u0027ve been preying on people,\" I pointed out. \"And girls have been vanishing near your base of operation. Seems kind of suspicious.\" He shook his head frantically, eyeing Volusian warily. \"No, it\u0027s not us.\" \"Have you heard of them disappearing?\" \"Yes. But it\u0027s not us.\" His words were adamant. \"Yeah, well, I find it hard to believe they\u0027re all running off. If it\u0027s not you, then who is it?\" \"You\u0027re a fool,\" the woman snapped. \"What would we do with a group of girls?\" \"The same thing men usually use girls for,\" I replied. \"We can barely feed our own people! Why would we take on more mouths to feed?\" That was kind of a good question. \"Well, you still haven\u0027t really given me another explanation.\" \"We heard a monster\u0027s doing it,\" the man blurted out. \"A monster,\" I repeated flatly. I looked over to Rurik who simply shrugged. I turned back to the prisoners. \"Any details on this monster?\" Neither responded. It was strange, particularly considering how some prejudiced part of me still regarded most gentry as dishonest, but I believed them about not taking the girls. I thought the monster explanation was bullshit, but they might honestly have believed it to be true. Volusian took a step forward without my command, and the guy hastily spoke. \"The monster lives in our land. In the Ald-Thorn Land, that is.\" \"How do you know that?\" I asked. \"Because only girls from the Thorn Land have disappeared,\" the woman said. \"Westoria borders the Rowan Land, and two of their villages are very close. Skye and Ley. But they\u0027ve had no one go missing.\" \"You guys seem to know a lot about this for allegedly not being involved.\" \"We don\u0027t need to be involved. We raid both sides of the border-word gets around.\" She spoke of her raiding as a matter of pride, and I tried not to roll my eyes. \"Okay. Let\u0027s put the girls on hold. Where did the fire demons come from?\" No answer. I sighed again. \"Volusian.\" Volusian swiftly moved forward again and wrapped his hand around the guy\u0027s throat. Most spirits had little substance, but with his power, Volusian was as solid as any of us, his touch cold and deadly. The man screamed and crumpled to the ground. \"Stop! Stop!\" yelled the woman. \"I\u0027ll tell you.\" I halted Volusian and looked at her expectantly. The man remained on the floor, rubbing his throat and moaning. The skin on his neck bore bright red marks. The woman looked angrier than ever. \"It\u0027s our leader who summons them. Cowan.\" \"You expect me to believe some vagrant has that kind of power?\" I asked. \"Why isn\u0027t he off working for a noble?\" \"He was a noble, one of Aeson\u0027s advisors. He preferred to live a rough life, rather than work for someone like you.\" \"Aeson did have a noble named Cowan,\" Rurik said. \"Her story isn\u0027t implausible.\" I suddenly felt weary. None of these were the answers I wanted. No leads on the girls, and now I had a rogue noble who could summon demons. \"Okay,\" I said. \"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got for now.\" \"What are you going to do with us?\" the woman demanded. \"Another excellent question,\" I murmured. \"Aeson would have killed them,\" said Rurik. \"And you know I\u0027m not Aeson.\" Would setting them free accomplish anything? Much of what they\u0027d done had been from hunger and desperation, not that that justified robbing and potentially killing and kidnapping. If I freed them out of guilt, I doubted they\u0027d learn their lessons and go on to become upright citizens. I certainly wasn\u0027t going to kill them, though. I didn\u0027t even want to hold them in this cell much longer. The guard who\u0027d accompanied Rurik cleared his throat. \"Your majesty, you could sentence them to a work detail.\" \"A work detail?\" \"There are others like them, other criminals, who serve a term doing labor as punishment for their deeds.\" \"Like digging your aque...whatever,\" said Rurik. That didn\u0027t sound so bad. And hey, it might actually be useful. I gave the order and was assured the two prisoners would be transported to their work site. The whole thing felt a little strange. Here I was judge, jury, and-if I chose-executioner. No one argued with my decision. No one questioned the time I set-six months. Although, Rurik\u0027s arched eyebrow made me think he would have sentenced them to life. \"Okay,\" I said when we\u0027d emerged out of the lower levels of the castle and I\u0027d sent away Volusian. \"Now I\u0027m going home.\" Shaya suddenly rounded the corner. \"There you are,\" she said anxiously. \"I\u0027ve been looking for you.\" \"I\u0027m leaving.\" Her face turned confused. \"But Prince Leith is here to see you.\" \"Who...oh.\" The image came back to me. The moderately cute guy from the party. The Rowan Queen\u0027s son, who hadn\u0027t been all that annoying. \"Why is he here?\" \"After your last visit, I dispatched those with any affinity for metal out to search for copper. They found a lot of it-thought it\u0027s been difficult to extract-and I sent out word that we\u0027d be in a position to set up trade for it soon. Leith is here to negotiate on behalf of his mother.\" \"Man,\" I said. \"You guys move fast.\" Her looked turned wry. \"Well, yes, but there\u0027s also the fact that you invited him to visit sometime. He\u0027s taking you up on the offer. In fact, I suspect seeing you is more important than the trade negotiations.\" \"Good thing. Because I\u0027m not so good in the way of negotiations.\" I never wore a watch and had left my cell phone back in Tucson. I had no idea what time it was, only that I was spending more and more time in the Otherworld. Seeing Leith was only going to delay me further. \"I\u0027ll see him. But it\u0027s going to be fast.\" Shaya looked relieved. I think she\u0027d worried I would bolt, which was a very good fear to have. As we walked to the chamber Leith was waiting in, she gave me a curious look. \"Perhaps you\u0027d...like to change and clean up first?\" I looked at my clothes. They were pretty badly wrinkled, and I didn\u0027t doubt that I had grass in my hair from last night. \"No,\" I said. \"The less appealing he finds me, the better.\" Unfortunately, that proved impossible. When we entered the room, Leith leapt up, face aglow with delight. \"Your majesty! It\u0027s so wonderful to see you again.\" He swept me a half-bow and kissed my hand. \"You look amazing.\" He was apparently into the grunge look. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind me arriving like this. When my mother heard the news of your find, she wanted to make sure we could get in on it as soon as possible.\" \"Sure,\" I said, taking my hand back. \"No problem.\" The room was a comfortable parlor that still bore the signs of Aeson\u0027s tastes in decorating. Tapestries, lots of velvet, and dark colors. Everyone waited for me to sit on one of the plush sofas and then followed suit. I made a point of kind of sprawling on mine. It wouldn\u0027t have been out of the range of gentry etiquette for Leith to come snuggle up beside me. As it was, he was still beaming at me and seemed a bit put out when Shaya jumped right in. \"So, your highness. We\u0027d like to discuss trading our copper for your wheat.\" As they began to talk, I had a sudden flashback to that god-awful board game my mother used to make me play, Pit. I let my mind wander as the two of them hashed out the finer details of matters I didn\u0027t entirely understand. My thoughts drifted to some upcoming jobs I had, the mystery of the demons and the missing girls, and of course, Kiyo. Always Kiyo. Leith and Shaya wrapped up their negotiations fairly quickly. From the happy look on her face, I took it our team had come out ahead. With a polite bow in my direction, Shaya rose, holding some papers to her chest. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027m going to have these written up and formalized so that the prince can sign them before he leaves.\" I took this as my cue to entertain him, but nothing readily came to mind. I couldn\u0027t really talk to him about reality TV or American politics. Finally, lamely, I said, \"Thanks for your help. I mean, with the trade and everything.\" He grinned. \"We\u0027re getting as much out of it as you. Maybe more.\" \"Shaya didn\u0027t seem to think so,\" I said, speaking without thinking. This made him laugh. \"She\u0027s a good negotiator. You\u0027re lucky to have her.\" He leaned forward. \"Especially since I\u0027m guessing this really isn\u0027t your...well, let\u0027s just say it\u0027s not one of your normal pastimes.\" The frankness caught me by surprise. I\u0027d expected him to remain starstruck and silly, like most of the guys around here who wanted to hit on me. Leith\u0027s current expression wasn\u0027t lecherous or adoring now, just knowing and sympathetic. \"No, it\u0027s really not. This is a kind of a big life change.\" \"And yet, you knew you\u0027d be taking this on when you defeated Aeson.\" I hesitated. Both Shaya and Rurik had hinted to me on a number of occasions that I really shouldn\u0027t elaborate on the totally unexpected-and unwanted-nature of my queen-ship. Even if I hadn\u0027t fought Aeson with the specific intent of supplanting him, the point remained now that I was stuck with this. Coming across as weak and whiny to those outside my inner circle could create more problems. \"Well, yeah,\" I said brightly. \"We just didn\u0027t anticipate this many problems when the land changed.\" \"But this is how your world is?\" \"The part I live in. But we\u0027ve had a long time to get used to it and figure out ways to survive and get water in. I gave Shaya books on how to construct some of that stuff, so hopefully she\u0027ll find someone to do it.\" His brow furrowed. \"Is there any way I could take a look? I might able to help.\" For a moment, I wondered if this was his new ploy to schmooze me-until I recalled what Shaya had said about him having a brilliant mind for technology, inasmuch as the gentry could. If he could parse diagrams and whatnot, it might be worth getting closer to him. \"Sure,\" I said. \"We could certainly use it.\" He smiled again, and as it lit up his face, even I could acknowledge he was pretty good-looking. Not like Kiyo, of course. Or even...well, like Dorian. But pretty cute. \"I\u0027ll set to it as soon as I can. If there\u0027s anything else I can do to make this easier for you, I\u0027ll do it.\" There was an enraptured look on his face. Yeah, he definitely had a crush, but he didn\u0027t irritate me in the way so many other more obnoxious suitors did. An odd thought occurred to me. \"Leith...here\u0027s something you might be able to help with. Have you ever heard of girls disappearing from the Rowan Land? In the areas that border my land?\" The look on his face showed that this was the last question he\u0027d expected from me. \"I...beg your pardon?\" \"Girls have been disappearing from my land, right near your borders.\" What were those names? \"Skye and Ley. But the people I talked to say nothing\u0027s happening to your girls. Do you know anything about this?\" He shook his head, utterly confused. \"No...I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know very much about the lives of those people.\" Leith\u0027s words weren\u0027t contemptuous by any means, but there was an implication that villagers and peasants just weren\u0027t people he associated with. It reminded me of Rurik\u0027s comments about how Aeson would have never troubled himself to investigate bandits or missing girls unless they directly affected him. Leith wasn\u0027t as much of an asshole as Aeson, but he and his mother were likely just as out of touch as any other noble. I think a fair amount of disappointment must have shown on my face because he suddenly grew eager to make me feel better. \"But I swear, I\u0027ll look into this when I return. I\u0027ll ask Mother, and we\u0027ll send messengers out to report back. I\u0027ll find out everything I can for you.\" I smiled at his enthusiasm. \"Thanks, Leith. It\u0027s really great of you to help.\" \"Helping a pretty queen is no trouble at all. By the way, have you ever thought about getting a crown?\" We talked a little longer, and I found he actually was a really nice guy, given to moments of humor and intelligence. It wasn\u0027t enough for me to jump into bed with him, but I appreciated finding someone else to connect with in the Otherworld. Shaya returned at last with the paperwork-hand-printed on scrolls, of course-and while Leith signed, we got a hold of the engineering books for him. His eyes widened with delight, and I swear, he probably could have sat down and started reading then and there on the floor. Instead, he took the hint that I had other things to do, and after many more compliments and hand kisses, he took his leave. \"You\u0027ve given him another open invitation,\" Shaya pointed out. \"Yeah, I know. But he\u0027s harmless. I like him.\" \"None of them are harmless, your majesty.\" I couldn\u0027t entirely tell if she was joking or not. \"Well, it\u0027ll be worth the hassle if he can solve our water problem and help with the girls.\" \"The girls?\" I gave her a quick recap of my interrogation with the prisoners. Her face turned thoughtful as she processed my words. \"Skye and Ley...\" \"Do you know those towns?\" She nodded. \"They and Westoria are configured in a way that places them equidistant from a gateway. A crossroads.\" \"What, to my world?\" She nodded again. \"Huh. I wonder if that\u0027s a coincidence. I wonder...I wonder if it\u0027s possible that...\" One of my crazier ideas came to me. \"Do you think those girls could be leaving and going to my world?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Shining ones do often cross over. It\u0027s not unheard of.\" \"Yeah, I know. To cause trouble. Or to steal women.\" I had to fight a scowl on that one. My own mother had been one such woman, abducted and forced to be my father\u0027s mistress. \"You think these girls are going to go kidnap guys so they can have kids?\" The easy ability to conceive was why so many humans got kidnapped. Usually, it was gentry men taking human women. Shaya\u0027s smile turned wry. \"I somehow doubt it would come to that. Women have been known to cross over, spend time in your world, and return pregnant. They don\u0027t need to bring the men back.\" Fair point. Well, this was certainly a weird development. I\u0027d have to wait and see what Leith reported back, but I supposed if these girls weren\u0027t actually being abducted...well, there was little for me to do. Admittedly, I\u0027d always fought adamantly against gentry sneaking to the human world, but I wasn\u0027t sure where the right and wrong of this situation lay. \"I guess that\u0027d be easier to deal with than a monster taking them. Still leaves that stupid demon problem.\" I sighed. \"Well, one issue at a time, I guess.\" \"Are you leaving now?\" \"Yes. Finally. Thanks for handling this today.\" \"Of course,\" she said. She actually sounded like she meant it. Her pleased expression turned momentarily hesitant. \"Although...there\u0027s something you should know. Someone else responded right away to the trade offer.\" \"That\u0027s good news.\" \"It\u0027s Dorian.\" \"Oh.\" Of course Dorian would respond. How could he stay away from an opportunity to put me at his mercy? \"You can deal with it, though, right?\" \"Well, that\u0027s just it. He\u0027s specifically requested that you talk to him. At his home.\" \"What?\" I stared. \"He...he can\u0027t do that.\" That wry smile of hers returned. \"He\u0027s a king. He can do anything he wishes.\" \"Yeah, but Leith came here! Dorian just wants me to go to him so that he can taunt me.\" And no doubt flaunt Ysabel in front of me. \"Leith\u0027s kingdom needs copper more than Dorian\u0027s. I suspect Dorian is doing this as a personal favor to you.\" \"That\u0027s not exactly how I\u0027d put it.\" She shook her head, the amusement now warring with exasperation. \"I know there\u0027s tension between you, but I suspect if you could be nice to King Dorian, he might make us a very generous deal. One that could help us immensely.\" A generous deal. The Oak Land was flourishing. I didn\u0027t doubt they had all sorts of food and other items we could use. I thought about those poor people in Westoria and even about my prisoners who\u0027d spoken of having too many mouths to feed. I sighed. \"Fine. I\u0027ll talk to him. And I\u0027ll even be nice.\" I started to turn away, needing more than ever to get back to my own home. Then I glanced back behind me. \"But Shaya? Just to be safe, you might want to keep looking for more trade partners.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-8.html","bookId":2039,"book":{"id":2039,"title":"Thorn Queen (Dark Swan #2)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 2: Thorn Queen Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld.
