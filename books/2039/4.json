{"id":109338,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"We left as soon as etiquette said we could. I tried using Shaya\u0027s argument about eccentric queens doing whatever they wanted, but it didn\u0027t work on her. She said if we didn\u0027t stay a certain amount of time, I\u0027d appear intimidated by Maiwenn. So, we stuck around a bit longer than I liked before finally making formal farewells to the others. Kiyo was preoccupied with a group of well-wishers, but he looked up at my departure and smiled. He mouthed the word soon.\n My group rode back in a subdued mood. The urgency was gone, and I think my glum attitude threw a cloud over everyone. Seeing Maiwenn and Kiyo had bothered me more than I liked to admit, and Dorian...well, that was another story. For now, I wanted nothing more than to cross over to my own world, throw on pajamas, and watch mindless TV. Possibly while eating ice cream.\n And as our journey continued, ice cream sounded more and more appealing once we crossed back into the Thorn Land. The sun was sinking, but heat still radiated off the sand and rocks. It wouldn\u0027t dissipate for another couple hours, and even at midnight, the temperature probably wouldn\u0027t drop below seventy. I\u0027d changed back to my shorts and sunglasses before leaving Maiwenn\u0027s, so again, the heat didn\u0027t bother me as much as it did the others. Dorian had claimed my sundress would catch on as a fashion trend; I wondered if shorts would as well.\n \"There\u0027s a village ahead,\" murmured Rurik.\n I snapped out of my daydreams and followed his gesture. Sure enough, a small cluster of buildings darkened the horizon. Like my castle, it was something more suited to a medieval British landscape than the desert. Considering how infrequently I visited my kingdom, this was the first settlement I\u0027d seen outside of the castle. It unnerved me a little, my discomfort growing when I saw that our road went straight through the town. Damned twisting Otherworld. This village hadn\u0027t been here on our earlier trip.\n And for that reason, I knew better than to suggest we go around it. With the way this world worked, a slight deviation could toss us into the Rowan Land or add hours onto our trip. Steeling myself, I tightened my grip on the reins, deciding that this place looked small and wouldn\u0027t take long to clear.\n When we entered its outskirts, though, I discovered something that made me lose my resolve. The road was lined with people. It was like everyone in the town had come out to see us pass through. They stood along the sides, staring at my party and again looking like extras from some medieval movie. Except, it must have been a low-budget movie. The people\u0027s clothes were ragged and dirty, their faces gaunt. Everyone seemed too skinny, even the children and babies held in parental arms.\n My unease grew as we rode deeper into the heart of the village. I hated crowds and having eyes upon me. There was something discomfiting about this particular group. Their expressions were either completely blank or...well, terrified. Everything was dead silent.\n \"What are they scared of?\" I whispered to Rurik.\n He gave me an amused glance. \"You, of course.\"\n \"Me?\" I squeaked. Glancing at my attire, I tried to imagine how out of place I looked here. Was my foreignness that frightening?\n \"You\u0027re their queen. Everyone knows how you slaughtered Aeson-and that isn\u0027t a particularly heartwarming tale. Likewise, Storm King\u0027s legacy of terror lives on after all these years. You\u0027ve inherited it.\"\n \"So, what, they see me as some kind of tyrant?\"\n He shrugged. \"You\u0027re their queen,\" he repeated, as though that explained everything.\n I\u0027d never wanted to be queen. I certainly didn\u0027t want to be seen as some kind of despot queen either. I didn\u0027t want these eyes upon me, these eyes that all seemed to be filled with apathy, judgment, and a kind of weary defeat. I breathed a sigh of relief when we reached what looked to be the halfway point. All of a sudden, a man stepped in front of us, bringing us to a halt.\n He was an older gentry, tall and gray-haired. He was skinny and clothed only a little better than the rest, though there was an air of dignity and authority that made him stand out. When he saw he had our attention, he swept me a bow so low, his face nearly touched the dusty road.\n \"To Eugenie, great queen of the Thorn Land, I offer the most humble greetings of your servant, Davros.\"\n At least, that\u0027s what I think he said. He was bent so low that his words came out muffled. I glanced uneasily at the others in my group, unsure what to do. They all remained silent and looked at me expectantly. Oh, sure. They were full of advice back at Maiwenn\u0027s, but when it came to peasants groveling in the road? That was apparently all me.\n \"Please, um, stand up,\" I managed at last. \"Um, Davros.\"\n He rose, clasping his hands in front of him, looking totally overwhelmed that I\u0027d used his name.\n \"Thank you, your majesty. I am the mayor of this village. Words cannot express what an honor it is to have you among us.\"\n Considering what Rurik had just told me about my reputation here, I wasn\u0027t entirely sure I believed Davros\u0027 words. I forced a smile.\n \"Thanks. We\u0027re just passing through on our way back to the castle.\"\n Davros spread his hands wide. \"I hope, then, that you\u0027ll consider resting and taking a brief refreshment in my home.\"\n \"Oh, well, that\u0027s really nice, but-\"\n Shaya cleared her throat loudly. I glanced over at her. She gave me a pointed look that gave no question to what she wanted me to do. Grimacing, I glanced back down at poor, groveling Davros. Damn. I wanted nothing more than to get out of the Otherworld right now. I didn\u0027t want to stop for teatime. My expression must have looked scary because Davros blanched and lowered his head meekly.\n I sighed. \"We\u0027d love to.\"\n Mayor or not, Davros didn\u0027t have a very big house. Only Shaya, Rurik, and I joined him inside, while the rest of my party milled around outdoors. From the village, Davros had invited a few other important officials, as well as his wife and two grown sons. We sat at a round oak table while his wife served us red wine and something that reminded me of baklava. I sipped only a little of the wine, not wanting to risk dehydration in this weather.\n I wasn\u0027t much better at making conversation here than at Maiwenn\u0027s, but fortunately, there was no need for me to do anything. Davros and his associates kept the talking going, most of the conversation centering on how glad they were that I had come by, what an honor it was to meet me, how they hoped I\u0027d call on them if I needed anything, et cetera, et cetera.\n Which was why it was a bit shocking when Davros\u0027 wife suddenly asked, \"But if you would, your majesty, please tell us what it is we\u0027ve done to displease you. We\u0027ll do anything at all to make amends and gain your favor once more. Anything.\"\n I almost choked on the honey cake. \"What do you mean...displease me?\"\n The villagers exchanged glances. \"Well...,\" said Davros at last. \"There must be something. You\u0027ve placed a blight on the land, stripping us of our water and food. Surely we\u0027ve done something to warrant your most righteous displeasure.\"\n \"You need only let us know what it is,\" piped in someone else. \"We will do anything you require to lift this curse from us.\"\n This was the most astonishing thing to happen to me all day-which was saying something. I looked at Shaya and Rurik for help, having no clue how to respond to this. For a moment, I thought they would once again make me fend for myself, until Shaya finally spoke.\n \"The residents had built their lives around the shape of the land when Aeson ruled it, when it was the Alder Land. When it transformed itself to you, their old ways no longer worked. Their crops don\u0027t grow in this weather. The wells have run dry.\"\n I stared at her in shock. Never, never had this occurred to me-but then, it wasn\u0027t like I\u0027d spent a whole lot of time thinking about the Thorn Land. Most of my energy had been spent on figuring out how to avoid it. Studying Shaya, I wondered how long she\u0027d known about this. I somehow doubted there was much that went on around here that she didn\u0027t know about. From the looks of Rurik\u0027s averted gaze, it appeared as though he\u0027d known about this problem as well. Both knew how upset I got when forced to deal with any sort of queenly issues. So both had spared me the details while these people suffered.\n I turned back to Davros. \"It\u0027s not a curse...it\u0027s, I don\u0027t know, it\u0027s just the way the land is. The way I wanted it to be.\"\n Astonished looks met me, and I could only imagine what a freak I sounded like. When Aeson had ruled, this land had been green and lush, filled with forests and fertile farmland. Who in their right mind would turn it into a desert? Davros confirmed as much.\n \"But this land...this land is impossible to survive in,\" he said.\n \"Not where I come from,\" I told him. \"This is like the land I grew up in. People live and flourish there.\"\n People also had modern ways of bringing in water and shopping for whatever other stuff they might need. And that wasn\u0027t even taking air-conditioning into account.\n \"How?\" he asked.\n I didn\u0027t know how to readily answer. I didn\u0027t really understand the intimate details of my world\u0027s infrastructure. I turned a faucet and water came out. I went to the grocery store and bought milk and Pop-Tarts. Desperately, I racked my brain and tried to pull out elementary school lessons about Arizona\u0027s history.\n \"Irrigation,\" I said lamely. \"Squash, I think. And, um, corn.\" Had the natives grown corn? Or was I getting confused by stereotypes? Shit. I was so ignorant. The only thing I felt confident of was that Pop-Tarts were not cultivated natively in Arizona. The looks the others gave me told me I wasn\u0027t helping this situation any.\n I glanced at Shaya and Rurik, but this time, no help came. The full weight of what I\u0027d done started to sink in. Maybe I hadn\u0027t wanted this land. Maybe I hadn\u0027t intentionally turned it into a mirror of wild Tucson. The point was: it was done. The Thorn Land was as it was, and taking in these ragged and starving people, I realized it was all my fault. Only, I had no clue how to fix it. I was too much a product of modern innovation. There was nothing I could do.\n Scratch that. There was one thing I could do.\n I abruptly stood from the table, catching everyone by surprise. As custom dictated, they all hastily scrambled and rose as well. Without explaining myself, I headed outside, back out into the village. Behind me, I could hear Davros babbling something, apparently thinking they\u0027d again caused offense. They probably thought I was about to send lightning bolts from the sky.\n As it was, that might not have been a bad idea-if I actually had that power. These people could certainly use rain. But one rainstorm wouldn\u0027t fix things, and I could hardly do it day after day. Instead, I walked out to the middle of the street and came to a halt. My guards straightened up, awaiting my orders, and other residents stopped to see what was happening. Those from Davros\u0027 gathering soon poured out of the house and joined everyone else.\n I closed my eyes, opening myself to the world around me. I smelled the clean, fresh scent of the desert and the faint, faint breeze blowing through it. The setting sun warmed my skin. Then, I pushed deeper, reaching out to that which the magic within me instinctively bonded to. I felt the minuscule water vapor in the air, but that wasn\u0027t what I wanted. I had to go further. I sent my magical senses into the ground, seeking water throughout the village. None. I remembered what Shaya had said about wells drying up, which meant the surface wasn\u0027t going to yield anything. That meant I\u0027d have to go deeper still.\n There. Back in the direction we\u0027d entered town, I felt a hit. I opened my eyes and strode toward it, the water calling to me. I was vaguely aware of a crowd following me, but I paid them no attention. Only the water was my goal. When I reached the spot, I found that it was just on the town\u0027s outer edge. A mesquite tree grew nearby, which should have been a tip-off. They had deep feelers that penetrated the earth in search of moisture.\n I too sent my power into the ground, trying to summon the water up. There was a lot of dirt between me and it, and I realized it wouldn\u0027t do these people any good in the long term to just suck it to the surface right now. I turned around and found Davros right behind me, face anxious. I pointed to the ground.\n \"You guys need to dig here. Right now. There\u0027s water here.\"\n He stared at me, mouth agape. A moment later, he snapped out of it and turned to those nearest him. \"You heard the queen! Fetch shovels immediately. And find anyone who can work with the earth.\"\n Earth magic. A smart idea. Gentry didn\u0027t have bulldozers or drills, but they did have people who could throw around huge piles of dirt, which was pretty sweet for this kind of thing. Dorian-who was probably the strongest earth user in the Otherworld-could cause earthquakes and level buildings.\n In minutes, a group had assembled. I tried to take a shovel and help, but that nearly caused Shaya and Davros to have a heart attack. Queens didn\u0027t do that kind of work. Instead, I stepped back, watching as the other villagers used magic and manual labor to dig where I\u0027d indicated. When the hole grew too deep for shovels, the village\u0027s two earth-magic users took over. Even combined, they were nowhere near Dorian in strength, but they definitely sped the process along, kicking up towers of dirt along the sides. Finally, I heard a great cheer. Everyone else and I crowded to the hole\u0027s sides, peering down. It was deep in the ground, but muddy water was slowly filling up the bottom.\n I looked at Davros. \"Can you guys turn this into a well?\" I certainly hoped so because I sure as hell had no idea how to do it. I imagined it involved stones and a bucket, but maybe that was just my na\u0026iuml;ve fairy-tale images.\n His head bobbed eagerly. \"Yes, yes, your majesty. Thank you, your majesty.\"\n After that, it was nearly impossible to leave. I was regarded as a miracle worker. I was no longer the tyrant queen. I was their savior, the generous and wonderful monarch who had brought life to their land. I declined their pleas to stay and celebrate but told them I\u0027d be back with other ways to save their town. Admittedly, I had no idea what that would entail, but mentioning such a minor detail would have seriously brought down everyone\u0027s mood.\n When we were finally mounted up and able to head out, I suddenly felt a tug on my shoe. Surprised, I looked down and saw a middle-aged man gazing up at me. A similarly aged woman stood close beside him.\n \"How dare you touch the queen!\" gasped Davros. From his face, it looked like he was seriously afraid I might level the town.\n I waved him off. \"It\u0027s okay.\"\n The man who\u0027d pulled my leg regarded me pleadingly. \"Please, your majesty. My wife and I have a boon to ask of you!\"\n \"That\u0027s a favor or a request,\" said Rurik helpfully.\n \"I know what a boon is,\" I snapped. I looked back down at the couple, unwilling to make any promises yet. \"What is it?\"\n The man put his arm around the woman. \"We\u0027ve heard that you\u0027re both a great warrior and a great magic user.\"\n \"And clearly kind and compassionate,\" added his wife.\n \"And?\" I asked.\n \"And very beautiful and-\"\n \"No,\" I exclaimed. \"I mean, what\u0027s your boon?\"\n \"Our daughter has been taken,\" the woman said, eyes filling with tears. \"We beg you to help us get her back.\"\n \"Whoa. That might be a little beyond my reach,\" I told them. \"When you say taken, do you mean, like, kidnapped?\"\n They both nodded, and I was swept by a strange sense of deja vu. I\u0027d first stumbled into this Otherworldly mess when I\u0027d been hired in the human world to also find a missing girl. The girl had turned out to be Jasmine, though I\u0027d had no clue at the time that she was half-gentry, let alone my sister. Was my life destined to be filled with missing girls?\n Davros stepped forward, looking upset and embarrassed. \"Your majesty, please ignore them for troubling you with something so meaningless. Their daughter was not taken by anyone. She ran off to Highmore with her lover from a neighboring village.\"\n I glanced at Shaya and Rurik. \"What\u0027s Highmore?\"\n \"Really?\" asked Rurik dryly. \"I thought you already knew everything.\"\n I glared at him.\n \"It\u0027s a city,\" said Shaya. \"The largest in this kingdom.\"\n \"Wait, what? I have cities?\" I asked, feeling my eyes go wide. The distraught couple interrupted my new revelation.\n \"Davros is wrong,\" the woman said. \"Our daughter did not run off. She was taken by the bandits who live in the passes.\"\n \"Everyone knows they\u0027re there,\" added the man. He eyed Davros. \"Them and their beasts. Even you won\u0027t deny their existence. They\u0027ve been there for years, and she isn\u0027t the first girl to disappear.\"\n I turned to Davros. \"Is that true?\"\n He shifted uncomfortably under my gaze. \"Well, yes, your majesty, but such brigands are nothing you need to concern yourself about, just as King Aeson did not.\"\n \"Wait. Aeson knew there were bandits going after you guys and didn\u0027t do anything?\"\n \"Such petty concerns were beneath him,\" said Davros. To my astonishment, he seemed to believe that.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said slowly. \"If a monarch doesn\u0027t take care of that kind of thing, I\u0027m not really sure what they\u0027re supposed to do.\"\n Truthfully, I didn\u0027t want to deal with this any more than I wanted any other Thorn Land responsibilities. But the mention of Aeson had stirred my blood. Aeson had been a self-serving asshole, and it pissed me off that he would have left these people to fend for themselves. The only thing I wanted less than to be a ruler was to be a ruler like him.\n Furthermore, the same fury that Jasmine\u0027s abduction had stirred in me flared up. Maybe it was my own experience with always being chased down by aggressive men, but I hated the thought of any girl facing rape or abduction. It didn\u0027t matter that these were gentry girls and not humans. The principle was the same. Brigands and thieves taking advantage of young girls, of preying on those weaker, had to be stopped.\n \"I\u0027ll send people to take care of these bandits,\" I said finally. Behind me, Rurik made a strange sound. \"But I can\u0027t make any guarantees about your daughter.\"\n The couple\u0027s faces lit up, and they fell to the ground in gratitude. \"Thank you, your majesty!\" the woman cried.\n Her husband chimed in. \"Truly you are generous and magnanimous and-\"\n \"Yeah, okay, there\u0027s no need for that,\" I said hastily. \"Or to kneel. You\u0027re going to get all dirty.\"\n We had just started to ride away when Shaya leaned toward me. \"You\u0027ve made a lot of promises today.\"\n I thought about it. She was right. I\u0027d promised to help them get food, rebuild their infrastructure, and rid themselves of those who preyed upon them. \"Yeah. I guess I did.\"\n She gave me a bemused look. \"And how are you going to accomplish all of this?\"\n I glanced around us, noting that the faces watching us leave town were no longer blank and afraid. They were grateful and adoring. I sighed.\n \"That,\" I told her, \"is an excellent question.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-4.html","bookId":2039,"book":{"id":2039,"title":"Thorn Queen (Dark Swan #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 2: Thorn Queen \n Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld.
