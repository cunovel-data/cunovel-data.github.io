{"id":109357,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Leith stood there, frozen, eyes on the gun. Finally, swallowing, he slowly lifted his gaze to my face. He was pale, so pale that he could have been on the verge of passing out.\n \"Eugenie...you\u0027re hurt...are you okay? There\u0027s blood on your bandage....\"\n I didn\u0027t doubt it and didn\u0027t bother to check. \"Stop it. Just stop your fucking concerned act. I don\u0027t want to hear it.\"\n In the corners of my eyes, I saw the gentry girls edge their way toward me like some sort of honor guard. I started to tell them to back off, but Leith had no real magic, and I was the one with the gun.\n \"What are you...? It-it\u0027s not an act, I swear it. I care about you. I love you.\"\n \"Love me?\" I snarled. \"People in love don\u0027t fucking drug and rape other people!\"\n \"It wasn\u0027t rape. Did I ever hurt you? Did I beat you?\"\n For a moment, I was so stunned that I couldn\u0027t even speak. \"You...you\u0027re serious, aren\u0027t you? You really believe that? You really believe you didn\u0027t do anything wrong!\"\n \"It was the only way I could convince you...the only way I could convince you that we\u0027re meant to be together. Normal courtship didn\u0027t work. Neither did Mother\u0027s attempt to just capture you and bring you to the Rowan-\"\n \"Her attempt to what?\"\n \"She used her magic to bind the power of several animals together and-\"\n \"Jesus Christ! That was her?\" Katrice had sent Smokey to bring me back for Leith. Lovely. Girard had mentioned her love of woodland animals but not her ability to control them.\n \"Look,\" Leith rambled desperately. \"We\u0027d be a great team-you know we would. We\u0027d have two kingdoms. You saw what I was able to do to help yours! With your power and my ingenuity-\"\n \"Ingenuity?\" I cried. I would have laughed if it wasn\u0027t all so horrible. \"You have none! You\u0027ve got a tiny bit more technological know-how than the average gentry, but everything else you stole from humans. You traded it in exchange for these girls\u0027 self-respect. You didn\u0027t even have the balls to kidnap from your own people!\"\n Again, much like when he\u0027d raped me, I wished he\u0027d be more belligerent. This idyllic, faux love was worse. It made everything he\u0027d done to me worse. I could feel my temper surging, anger racing through me. I could hardly see because of my fury. Or maybe it was the blood loss. Odder still was a strange shift in the air, a cooling off. It had been humid and stuffy before, but it was definitely cooler now. Not in the way that heralded a Volusian appearance but something different altogether that I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on.\n \"I won\u0027t do it again, I swear. If that\u0027s what you want, if that\u0027s what\u0027ll make you happy and let us be together...\"\n He took a step toward me, and I fired a warning shot that just cleared his arm and hit the cupboard behind him. He promptly stopped moving, face going paler still.\n \"Don\u0027t move!\" I screamed. \"Don\u0027t even think about touching me.\"\n I still couldn\u0027t believe it, still couldn\u0027t believe he was going on like this. I kept thinking about what it had been like in bed with him, that forcing and total violation of my body. Once more, there was a slight shift in the air, and I realized what it was. The barometric pressure. I didn\u0027t know how I knew, but I did. It was dropping. Rapidly. Ozone wafted through the air.\n \"I love you,\" he said in a small voice.\n \"You are a self-centered, fucking asshole rapist,\" I replied evenly. \"And I-I am the Thorn Queen.\" As the words left my mouth, I suddenly understood what Dorian had meant about me needing to believe I was queen. In that moment, I did. And a person like Leith did not do something like that to someone like me.\n \"I\u0027m the Thorn Queen,\" I repeated. Now the air stirred, around us, causing the curtains to flutter and a few things to fall off the counter. \"And you are going to pay for what you\u0027ve done.\"\n \"Eugenie, stop. Put the gun down.\"\n I lifted my eyes from Leith\u0027s cringing form, and this time, I did laugh-but it was more of a choking sound. Kiyo, Dorian, and Roland stood in the entrance to the kitchen. My saviors. After leaving that front door open when Art had come home, it was like anyone could just traipse right in.\n \"Jesus Christ,\" I said. \"You guys are a little too late.\"\n It was Kiyo who had spoken, his face tense and worried. \"Everyone needs to calm down. You got him, Eugenie. It\u0027s over. Put the gun away now.\"\n Roland was tense too, his face unreadable as he stood with his own gun. Beside him, Dorian didn\u0027t seem overly worried, but there was none of that usual laughter on his face.\n \"You don\u0027t know what he\u0027s done,\" I growled. \"You keep talking about mercy, but at some point it has to end. He needs to die.\" The wind grew stronger. Some of my hair whipped in my face, but I had no free hand to brush it aside.\n \"I didn\u0027t do anything!\" exclaimed Leith. He looked to the other men, face desperate and pleading. \"I won her fairly. You know how it is. Back in the old days, that\u0027s how it was. The man who caught the queen became king. If she\u0027s pregnant, she\u0027s my common-law wife.\"\n I saw disgust on Roland\u0027s face, his hand tightening on the gun. He started to lift it, but Kiyo, still apparently the spokesperson, made a small motion that caused my stepfather to lower the gun back down. Slightly. \"That tradition is like a thousand years old,\" Kiyo told Lieth. \"It means nothing anymore. She\u0027s not yours.\"\n \"Besides,\" I said, my gaze back on Lieth. \"Do you really think I\u0027d have your baby if I didn\u0027t want to? If I\u0027m pregnant, it\u0027s an easy problem to fix.\"\n His mouth dropped open. \"You wouldn\u0027t...that\u0027s blasphemous...\"\n And indeed it was among the child-hungry gentry. Abortion was nothing I relished either, but there was no way on this earth I would bear a child born of such brutality. A gust of wind suddenly picked up considerably, nearly knocking me over. The kitchen window shattered.\n Kiyo was still unmoved. \"Eugenie, stop it. Stop the magic. Put the gun down. We\u0027ll take him and the girls back. We\u0027ll deal with him in the Otherworld.\"\n \"How can you say that?\" I shouted. \"You heard him! How can you let him walk after all this? You don\u0027t know what he\u0027s done!\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t necessarily have to go free,\" argued Kiyo. \"There are other ways.\"\n A blinding flash suddenly burst in the kitchen, leaving me dazzled and unable to see for a moment. At the same instance, there was a crackling roar, so loud that I thought my eardrums would burst. And like that, the means to control lightning clicked in my brain. I understood the patterns, what I needed to summon it-and how to work my emotion into it as Ysabel had said.\n I set the gun on the counter. \"I don\u0027t need this,\" I told Leith. The wind was roaring around us now, knocking objects everywhere, blowing my hair like a cloud of fire. I was the center of the storm. A very, very faint roll of thunder-nowhere near as loud as the last one-sounded around us. I turned my gaze to Leith, wondering if my violet eyes had darkened the way Storm King\u0027s had when angry. \"I\u0027m going to suck the air from you and then blast you out of existence with lightning.\"\n Leith sank to his knees. \"Please...please don\u0027t do this...\" The same words I\u0027d uttered to him the first time he\u0027d assaulted me.\n The storm raged more strongly around me. \"I\u0027m the Storm Queen,\" I said in a low voice. \"And you will pay for what you\u0027ve done to me.\"\n Kiyo took a step forward. I knew him well enough to guess his thoughts. He was considering attacking me but too greatly feared what I could do with the magic as it grew stronger and stronger. He made one last desperate plea.\n \"If you care anything about your people-about those girls-you won\u0027t do this. He\u0027s a prince. You kill him, and his mother will declare war on you. You think the drought was bad? Imagine armies sweeping in and devastating your land. Villages burned. Innocent people killed. Is that what you want? Can you do that to them?\"\n Around us, the storm raged, and within me, my hate for Leith was a storm of its own, a poison running through my veins. I wanted him to suffer. I wanted him blighted. I wanted him dead. He could not be allowed to be free of his sins. And yet...somewhere in all that hate, all that fury, Kiyo\u0027s words penetrated. Is that what you want? Can you do that to them?\n I stared at Leith for several more heavy seconds. And then, bit by bit, the storm began to recede. No more lightning. The wind faded. Clouds vaporized. The pressure rose to levels similar to those outside. Leith sagged in relief, and I noticed how ragged my breathing was from the exertion of such power.\n \"No,\" I said softly, feeling all the energy run out of me. I was tired. So, so tired. \"I don\u0027t want a war. I...I can\u0027t unleash something like that.\"\n Then, for the first time so far, Dorian spoke.\n \"I can,\" he said.\n And before anyone really realized what was happening, he strode across the kitchen. His sword came out from its sheath, brilliant and deadly in the light, and he plunged it straight into Leith\u0027s body. The Rowan Prince stiffened, eyes going wide, as Dorian pushed the blade further into Leith\u0027s stomach.\n Time stood still for all of us. I don\u0027t think anyone-well, except for Dorian-really believed it had happened. A moment later, Dorian jerked the sword out in one swift, harsh motion. Leith\u0027s body fell to the ground. Dorian had used the new sword, I realized, the iron-laced one Girard had made. Blood poured out from where it had impaled Leith, as well as from his lips. It was a hundred times worse than the mess Art had left, and as that deep red liquid pooled and pooled, a bizarre image of blooming roses floated across my mind. I wondered if I was going to pass out.\n Kiyo surged forward, like he might save Leith, but we all knew it was too late. The prince was already dead. Kiyo turned to Dorian in rage. \"What have you done?\"\n Dorian\u0027s face was calm, voice smooth as he slid the sword-blood and all-back into its sheath. \"What you should have done.\"\n Kiyo stared at Dorian, who returned the gaze squarely. Kiyo\u0027s face was a mixture of many things: outrage, shock, fear. \"You have no idea what you\u0027ve done...what you\u0027ve unleashed...what you\u0027ve unleashed on her....\"\n Dorian glanced down at Leith\u0027s body, then Art\u0027s, and then back to Leith. The look of contempt on his face clearly showed just how beneath his acknowledgment they were. They were not even worth his notice, not even worth regarding as people as far as Dorian was concerned. He looked back up at Kiyo.\n \"I know what I\u0027ve done. And do you think I\u0027d really abandon her to the consequences? Leave her alone to them? Besides...\" A wry smirk crossed Dorian\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m the one who did it. I\u0027m the one Katrice will come after.\"\n Kiyo shook his head. \"No. She\u0027ll come after both of you. You shouldn\u0027t have done it.\"\n After what felt like an eternity, my voice had finally come back to me. I wet my lips, trying to speak. \"Maybe,\" I whispered. \"Maybe he should have...\"\n Silence fell over us all, thick and heavy. Kiyo gave me a look...I couldn\u0027t fully interpret it. \"You\u0027re in shock. You don\u0027t what you\u0027re saying. We\u0027ll get you and the girls back to the Otherworld. Art\u0027s records might show us how to track the others.\"\n I looked back and forth between his and Dorian\u0027s faces. I wouldn\u0027t go so far as to say I hated all men, exactly, but suddenly, I just couldn\u0027t be with either of them, even though I loved them both. Plus, at the moment, I didn\u0027t want anything to do with the Otherworld. I shook my head.\n \"No. Take the girls...I\u0027m not going.\"\n Dorian arched an eyebrow. \"What will you do?\"\n I turned toward Roland for the first time in a while. He still had his gun, but it was lowered now. He\u0027d been ready to attack the whole time but had been content to let the other two men take the lead in this. Later, I would have to find out how this motley crew had banded together. Right now...right now I was more concerned with the look on Roland\u0027s face. He was regarding me like he didn\u0027t know me. I felt a piece of my heart break.\n \"I want...\" And to my shame, I felt tears burn in my eyes, which was just stupid. Throughout this entire week, I\u0027d never cried. I\u0027d taken it all straight-faced. I\u0027d fought and killed today without remorse. Now...now it was like a lifetime of sorrow was coming out of me. \"I want to go home,\" I said. The tears escaped, running down my cheeks. \"I want to see my mom.\"\n For a second, I thought Roland was going to turn away, condemn me as the half-gentry he\u0027d always feared I would turn into, the one who\u0027d lied to him about her involvement in the Otherworld. I think if he had turned away, I would have died then and there. Instead, he held out his hand. I couldn\u0027t actually bring myself to take it. I didn\u0027t think I could let anyone touch me right now. I loved all the men here, but right now, I was inexplicably afraid of them.\n Still, I felt safe leaving with Roland. Roland was my father. Understanding my feelings, he lowered his hand and simply beckoned. I approached him, stepping over the bodies in the kitchen.\n \"Okay,\" Roland said softly, his own eyes shining with tears. \"Let\u0027s go home.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-25.html","bookId":2039,"book":{"id":2039,"title":"Thorn Queen (Dark Swan #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 2: Thorn Queen \n Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld.
