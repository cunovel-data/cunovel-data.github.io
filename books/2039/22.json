{"id":109354,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"I woke up with a headache even worse than the one I\u0027d gotten shooting tequila on the night of Luisa\u0027s birth. Pain thudded to a steady drumbeat in my head, though at the same time, my senses felt foggy as a boring plaster ceiling slowly came into focus above me. Nausea welled up in my stomach, and I worried I was going to get sick. It had happened the last time I\u0027d come crashing through the worlds. And speaking of the worlds...where was I? Easy enough to figure out, my groggy brain quickly realized. I\u0027d been pulled out from the Otherworld, which meant I could either have been sent to the Underworld or the human world. The fact that I was still alive indicated I\u0027d gone onto the latter. Why on earth would Abigail summon me to-fuck. There it was: the nausea again. I bit my lip and tried to sit up, not wanting to choke on my own vomit. Only, when I tried to rise, I didn\u0027t get very far. My hands were stretched above my head, tied to the headboard of the bed I lay on. No, not tied-cuffed. Cuffed with heavy steel, industrial-strength handcuffs. Bound or no, I did manage some semblance of sitting, just as my stomach betrayed me. A bowl got shoved under my face right at that moment, and I was grateful to spare the bedding and my clothes. I threw up twice before my benefactor gently asked, \"Any more?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" I squinted up and found myself looking into the face of a young girl, heavily freckled and brown-haired, with a nose a bit too small for the rest of her facial features. She was still cute enough, though, and-she was a gentry. For a moment, I wondered if I\u0027d gotten confused about the banishment. Was I still in the Otherworld? No. This was definitely the human world. I could sense it. There was a way that magic hung in the air-or, rather, didn\u0027t hang in the air around here. The girl took the bowl away and returned with a damp cloth. She wiped my face with it and then my mouth. A moment later, she returned with a glass of water, which I drank gratefully. All of her movements were gentle and graceful. \"What\u0027s your name?\" I asked. \"Cariena.\" \"That\u0027s really pretty. Where am I, Cariena?\" I asked, tugging at the handcuffs. Those things weren\u0027t going to budge. The girl sat down on a chair in the corner. \"In the world of the humans.\" \"I know that.\" I tried hard not to let my tone get harsh. My leather from the fight was gone; I wore a T-shirt and underwear. \"But where? What is this place?\" She glanced around, as though the room might offer some secret insight. The walls were painted pale gray and matched the bedspread, a pattern of purple and grayish blue flowers. There was a small dresser in the corner, along with her chair, as well as the narrow twin bed I lay in. There wasn\u0027t a lot of space here-and no windows at all. \"The Red Snake Man\u0027s house.\" \"The Red Snake-son of a bitch. Art.\" My mind was still fuzzy, and I had a hard time grasping all the details of what had happened. I remembered bits and pieces of the fight. I remembered chasing the soldier and then Abigail banishing me... But it was all still disjointed, and I had no recollection of how I\u0027d gotten here. It was possible that was simply from the trauma of tearing through the worlds. Someone could have smacked me upside the head too, but the pain throbbing in my skull wasn\u0027t that type. As I\u0027d noted earlier, it was more like the hangover type. Only worse. \"Where is he now?\" I asked. Cariena shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know. He doesn\u0027t explain his activities to us.\" \"Us? Are there...\" Again, my addled brain tried to remember what I already knew. Why couldn\u0027t I line up my thoughts? It was like I had both the buzz and the hangover from drinking, all wrapped up into one. Us. Art. Red Snake Man. \"Are there...others like you here? Other girls?\" She nodded. \"How many?\" \"Five-no, four. They took Fara yesterday. Isanna\u0027s next.\" \"They who?\" \"One of the men. They come sometimes. They look at us. Sometimes they just...\" She looked away, unwilling to meet my eyes. \"Sometimes they just...visit. But sometimes they make a deal with the Red Snake Man to take one of us.\" \"Art,\" I murmured. \"His name is Art. Red Snake Man seems to give him some semblance of respect.\" I started to rub my eyes and then realized I couldn\u0027t with the cuffs. \"Are the other girls chained up too?\" \"Only the ones who resist.\" \"Well, yeah, I guess that would include me. I take it you\u0027re not one?\" \"Not anymore.\" \"Why don\u0027t you leave? You must have some magic...even a little.\" Cariena held up her hands. She didn\u0027t have handcuffs like me, but snug iron bracelets hugged each wrist, each with a tiny lock. The skin was red and swollen where the iron touched. \"Jesus...so you\u0027re blocked from your magic. But, I mean, can\u0027t you just walk out the door?\" \"There\u0027s iron...iron everywhere. The windows, the doors. They\u0027re all bound with iron and spells. And locks. Besides...\" Her blue eyes widened slightly. \"I don\u0027t know where I would go...not in this world...\" \"Home,\" I said fiercely. \"You\u0027ll go home. I\u0027ll take you there.\" She shook her head, face sad. \"There\u0027s no escape from here. Not even for you.\" I eyed her curiously. \"Do you know who I am?\" \"You are the Thorn Queen. Storm King\u0027s daughter. You are my sovereign.\" She gave a deferential nod of respect. \"And I know you are a great warrior and magic user. But if the Red Snake Man caught even you, then there\u0027s no hope for any of us. Moria tried to escape, and she died out there.\" \"Moria did escape. She didn\u0027t die, and-\" I stopped. Why was my brain such mush? Why was I thinking so slowly? A great warrior and magic user. I didn\u0027t need my hands to get out of here. I had my magic. The iron and steel that stunted Cariena\u0027s magic had hardly any effect on me, and I would have had enough time by now to rebuild my stores of power. I reached into myself and then to the world around, seeking water and air, though not certain what I\u0027d do with them. Blow the headboard apart? Oxidize the handcuffs? The decision turned out not to matter. Nothing happened. I felt nothing. I felt...well, human. I felt as I had for years, long before I\u0027d had any clue I could touch any sort of Otherworldly magic. I was cut off. My mind touched only empty space. \"What\u0027s wrong with me?\" I asked, true panic starting to unravel in me. \"My magic\u0027s gone. The steel shouldn\u0027t affect me...\" \"It\u0027s not the steel,\" a voice suddenly said. \"It\u0027s the nightshade. And I think you\u0027re overdue.\" Art strolled into the room, looking as dashing as ever with his tanned skin and movie-star smile. I had nothing but contempt for him and instinctually tried to break the cuffs. Nightshade...nightshade. Where had I heard that before? Rurik, I realized. He\u0027d advised something called a tincture of nightshade to completely cut off Jasmine from her magic. Was that what I\u0027d been given? He\u0027d said it was the most effective...but that it made those with human blood feel dazed and sick. All of a sudden, I knew this fuzzy hangover feeling didn\u0027t have anything to do with me being banished. There was no real purpose in discussing nightshade with Art, so I got right to the point. \"I\u0027m going to kill you.\" Art laughed that hearty, deep laugh I\u0027d once found endearing. \"Forgive me if I\u0027m not scared.\" He turned to Cariena. \"Go get some more nightshade for Eugenie. And make sure Isanna is dressed and ready to go when Abigail returns.\" Cariena was practically out of the room before he finished speaking. \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" I said. \"It\u0027s really true. When I first started putting together this fairy sex-trade theory, I thought it was as crazy as Roland thought it was. But it\u0027s really true. Where\u0027s this Isanna going? Is Abigail taking her to her new owner?\" He leaned back and crossed his legs. \"I suppose you could say that. I like to think of it as her new loving home. The man who bought her is very eager to welcome her.\" \"You\u0027re a fucking bastard,\" I growled. \"Selling them like they\u0027re property.\" \"Might as well be. And if it makes you feel better, I don\u0027t sell all of them. Cariena there...hmm, well, she\u0027s not pretty enough to get a good price. Easier to keep her around for house calls.\" \"House calls.\" I started to feel sick again, and it had nothing to do with the nightshade. \"Basically, you\u0027re whoring her out. You sell sex slaves and run a brothel-and yet, all the while, you play hero shaman like you\u0027re doing the world a good deed. Roland couldn\u0027t say enough nice things about you.\" Art straightened up, feet hitting the floor as a flash of anger shone in his eyes. \"I am doing the world a good deed-this world. Those girls? They\u0027re nothing. They aren\u0027t human. And you...\" He shook his head. \"You\u0027re one to talk about image. You play hero shaman too, when in reality you\u0027re off commanding gentry armies. Does Roland know? Does he know what you really are? I\u0027m sure he has to know you\u0027re a half-breed mongrel, but does he really know the extent of it?\" White-hot rage burned within the drug-induced haze of my mind. \"I think you forgot the part where I\u0027m going to kill you.\" \"And you forgot the part where I said I\u0027m not worried.\" Cariena returned holding a coffee mug. I eyed it warily. \"What are you going to do with me?\" I demanded. \"You would have killed me already if you could, yet you probably aren\u0027t going to let me go now that I know your dirty secret. Are you going to sell me off too? Keep me for yourself since you don\u0027t like gentry?\" Art shook his head and approached my bed. \"Eugenie, you couldn\u0027t pay me enough to keep you around. I\u0027d take one of these idiot girls any day. Turn on the microwave, and they\u0027re so scared that they\u0027ll stay docile for weeks.\" He gestured Cariena to his side and reached down to hold my head in place. I realized what he was going to do and began thrashing. With one hand he tried to keep me still, and with the other he partially held my mouth open. \"Do it,\" he said. Obediently, Cariena poured the liquid from the mug into my half-open mouth. As she did, she mouthed, I\u0027m sorry. The stuff tasted horrible, and I gagged on it. I tried to spit it out, but Art promptly covered my mouth until I had to swallow. That bitterness flowed down my throat, and I could feel a new wave of numbness start to sweep over me. \"Yes,\" said Art, almost cheerfully. \"You\u0027re trouble. I don\u0027t want you. I don\u0027t know any human who would. But fortunately, we got an offer from someone who isn\u0027t.\" I think he was smiling that stupid smile again, but I could never say for sure. The force of the nightshade flooded through me, pulling me into fuzziness, then darkness, and then sleep. I immediately noticed two things when I came to later. One was that Art was still in the room, though I think he\u0027d just returned and hadn\u0027t been watching me sleep. The other thing I noticed was that I was uncuffed. I didn\u0027t waste any time. I promptly leapt out of the bed and charged him. Unfortunately, I didn\u0027t really make it off the bed so well. The nightshade was chugging along in my system, and my limbs barely had the energy to stay upright. I fell off the bed and collapsed into an ungraceful pile on the floor. Cariena was there too, holding a bundle of clothing, and started to come help me. Art shook his head, and she froze. \"Looks like you won\u0027t be killing me today,\" he said. \"You fucking bastard,\" I said, tossing one arm on the bed and attempting to pull myself up. \"How long was I out?\" \"Oh, an hour or so. That\u0027s usually the worst part of it for humans. Now that you\u0027re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, Cariena\u0027s going to help you look respectable.\" I glared at him. I didn\u0027t know who\u0027d stripped me down to this T-shirt and underwear, but if it had been him, he\u0027d die extra slow. The scathing look he gave me suggested, however, that he found as little pleasure in me as I did in him. \"You can\u0027t keep me here,\" I warned, managing at last to sit back on the bed. \"Someone\u0027s going to come looking for me.\" \"Who?\" he asked. \"You were the idiot who wandered off from your people. None of them saw you taken. None of them saw me or any of my companions-well, except for your two meager guards, and they won\u0027t say anything to anyone ever again.\" With a sinking feeling, I knew he was right. Nobody knew what had happened to me. I\u0027d mentioned the Yellow River theory off and on to a few of my friends, but none of them had any reason to suspect that was connected to my post-battle disappearance. If anything, they\u0027d probably think there\u0027d been another demon on the loose. \"Who the hell were your companions anyway?\" I demanded, recalling the trained fighters. \"Did you hire a mercenary army or something?\" Art only smiled. \"Cariena, get her dressed.\" To me, he said, \"Cooperate, or she\u0027ll be the one who suffers for your disobedience.\" He left, shutting the door behind him. I heard the snick of a lock. Across the room, Cariena watched me with big, terrified eyes. She feared both me and Art. I sighed. \"It\u0027s okay. I\u0027ll get dressed. I don\u0027t want to run around in my underwear anyway.\" Visibly relieved, she stepped forward and unfurled what she held: a dress. A gentry-style dress. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" I said. \"Isn\u0027t there something else?\" Cariena cringed. \"It\u0027s all he gave me.\" I eyed the bedspread, almost wondering if I could go all Scarlett O\u0027Hara and make something for myself. Then, seeing Cariena\u0027s pale face, I yielded again. I wouldn\u0027t let Art beat her or give her to some guy because of me. I took the dress from her but discovered I couldn\u0027t put it on without help, not with my weak muscles and groggy motor control. Being in that state infuriated me. I hated being helpless. More upsetting still was that I was essentially free, unbound and able to move about...but I had no means to fight or defend myself. I could barely even stand. I was a prisoner in my own body. The dress was a mix of lavender and pale blue. I guess you\u0027d call it periwinkle, which I\u0027d always thought was a dorky name. It was made of smooth, clingy velvet that hugged my body and laced up the back corset-style. The sleeves were long and form-fitting, and the scoop neckline was much lower than my usual style. I\u0027d only wear something that showed that much cleavage if I was going on a date with Kiyo-or trying to coax a favor from Dorian. Kiyo and Dorian. It sounded pathetic and all damsel-in-distress, but I would have given anything to have them here right now. Cariena clasped her hands and studied me almost adoringly. \"You look beautiful, your majesty. I see now why you have so many suitors back in our world.\" Our world. \"Well, I don\u0027t think my beauty plays quite as much a role as you think.\" She produced a brush and undid the knotted ponytail in my hair. \"I don\u0027t know if I want to be beautiful or not. I used to think I did. But since I\u0027m not, no one will take me from here.\" She sounded grateful. \"You are beautiful,\" I said sharply, angry at what Art had said. \"And someone is going to take you from here-me.\" Cariena gave me a small, sad smile, but for the first time, I thought there might be something like hope in her eyes. A knock at the door startled her back into timid mode as she leapt up from where she\u0027d sat beside me. \"Oh! He\u0027s here.\" \"Who?\" I asked. Surely Art wouldn\u0027t have knocked. The lock clicked, and the door opened. Leith walked in. \"Leith!\" I exclaimed. He looked as I\u0027d seen him before, clad in a red and white silk shirt, dark hair glossy and swept from his face in a ponytail. I wanted to jump up but knew I\u0027d fall to the floor again. \"Thank God.\" Someone did know I was here. I wasn\u0027t lost forever. I wanted to tell Cariena we were on the verge of freedom, but she was already scurrying out of the room and hastily shutting the door. \"Eugenie,\" breathed Leith, striding toward me. He knelt on the ground and caught hold of my hands where I sat. \"You are stunning...as beautiful as I remember. No, more so. You can\u0027t imagine how I\u0027ve missed you.\" A chill crept along my spine. Something was very, very wrong here. \"Leith...we have to get out of here. You have to help me-and these girls. There are horrible things going on here.\" \"We can leave,\" he said. \"But not quite yet. Not until everything\u0027s settled.\" I tested his hand to see if I could free mine. I couldn\u0027t. \"Until what\u0027s settled?\" \"Until then,\" he continued, as though I hadn\u0027t spoken, \"you\u0027ll have to stay here where no one can find you. But I promise I\u0027ll visit you every day.\" \"I can\u0027t stay here! I have to get back to...anywhere that\u0027s not here. Tucson. The Thorn Land. Anywhere! Leith, what the hell is going on? Why are you here?\" \"Because you are. Because Art got you for me.\" That chill down my spine spread to the rest of my body until I felt cold all over. I tried jerking my hand away again but didn\u0027t possess the strength. \"How do you know Art? Oh God. Please tell me you aren\u0027t working with him.\" He shrugged. \"It\u0027s a mutually beneficial relationship. I help him collect girls in our-in the Otherworld.\" \"Girls from my kingdom,\" I said, the realization coming suddenly. \"That\u0027s why none of yours were ever taken.\" Leith had the grace to look sheepish. \"I don\u0027t take important ones, Eugenie. Just peasants. No one notices they\u0027re missing.\" \"Their parents do.\" \"Look, it doesn\u0027t matter. My soldiers help round them up, and I bring them to Art and Abigail to do what it is they do.\" My soldiers. The soldiers who always wore red, just like Leith did now. Normally, red shirts made me think of Star Trek extras, but in this case, it was in tribute to the Rowan Land\u0027s flag and emblem. The soldiers Jasmine and others had seen weren\u0027t Aeson\u0027s deserters. They\u0027d been sent by Leith to help Art and Abigail with their abductions. \"They sell them, Leith! How can you stand by and enable that? They sell those girls to horny guys against their will. What can you possibly get out of it to justify having that on your conscience?\" \"This.\" He gestured around. \"Art and Abigail share things with me...their knowledge from this world. I take it back to mine.\" I stared in disbelief. \"And then you pass it off as your own. That\u0027s why everyone thinks you\u0027re such a technological genius. Did you really devise those irrigation plans for me yourself?\" \"No,\" he admitted. \"I had help. But does it really matter? Look, you don\u0027t know what it\u0027s like. You\u0027re strong. Your magic grows more powerful every day. But me? I\u0027m a joke. I can\u0027t inherit. Proving myself with my \u0027genius\u0027 was the only way to get any respect...and even that wouldn\u0027t be good enough to let me inherit. Until I met you.\" \"Leith-\" \"I know what you said, but my feelings haven\u0027t changed. I love you. And I know if you just spend a little more time with me, you\u0027ll love me too. We connect. There\u0027s something between us. It\u0027s more than just about power.\" I leaned back. It was the only way I could put distance between us. \"I\u0027m not so sure about that. You think I\u0027m your meal ticket to holding on to the Rowan Land.\" \"Not just that land, but all the lands! This world too. Eugenie, when you bear my son, you\u0027ll see that I\u0027m right.\" There was a zealous glow in his eyes, and I couldn\u0027t decide if he was crazy or just really, really believed these things would be true if he said them. Maybe there wasn\u0027t a difference. \"I can make you happy-and I know you can make me happy. You\u0027re so beautiful....\" He moved up to sit beside me on the bed and ran one hand along my velvet-covered leg. \"Leith...don\u0027t...\" \"I just need to get you pregnant,\" he said earnestly. \"Don\u0027t you understand? If I bring you back to our world carrying my child, everything will be solved. Art told me...he told me how you stop yourself from conceiving. How you take some potion every day.\" His hand moved up to my hip while his other touched my face and stroked my hair. I tried to back away, but his grip was too strong in my addled state. \"He said if you\u0027re away from it long enough that you\u0027ll be able to have a baby....\" I swallowed. My heart was threatening to pound out of my chest. \"No...it won\u0027t work. You can\u0027t get me pregnant-because I already am.\" His caresses froze. \"What?\" \"You were right before about me being involved with Dorian. Kiyo was a cover. He\u0027s not worthy-he\u0027s no one I\u0027d want to father my child. Dorian and I have been lovers for a long time now in secret. We were afraid of what his enemies would do if they found out. I\u0027ve been pregnant for...\" What wouldn\u0027t show? \"...two months. It\u0027s too late for you, Leith.\" He had gone perfectly still, save for his eyes, which were searching my face thoroughly. \"I don\u0027t believe you. You\u0027re lying. Everyone knows how you bicker with the Oak King. You aren\u0027t lovers.\" \"We are. He\u0027ll kill you when he finds out.\" Leith shook his head and slid his hand from my hip to my stomach. \"There\u0027s nothing here. Not yet.\" Panic flooded me, and for a moment I couldn\u0027t breathe. Every other time I\u0027d come close to being raped flashed through my mind-and there had been far more of those times than I would have liked. And every time, I had escaped the situation. Yet that never made the next time any less terrifying. This was no exception. \"Leith, please don\u0027t do this.\" His hand moved fumblingly to my breast, and then he pushed me back against the bed. \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said, speaking as one would to a child. \"It\u0027ll be okay. You\u0027ll like it. I promise.\" \"Don\u0027t do this!\" His mouth was on my neck, and lovesick boy or no, there was definitely a man\u0027s sexual need there. I struggled against him, trying desperately to free myself, but I might as well have truly been a child. With that fucking drug in me, both my body and brain were a mess. My body had none of its ability to fight him or stop him from pushing up my skirt. My brain had no clever ways to talk him out of this. And as he took off his own clothes and laid his body on top of mine, pressing me down, I realized he needed no handcuffs to keep me subdued. The strength of his hands pinning my wrists was more than enough.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/thorn-queen-dark-swan-2/page-22.html","bookId":2039,"book":{"id":2039,"title":"Thorn Queen (Dark Swan #2)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 2: Thorn Queen Eugenie Markham is a shaman for hire, paid to bind and banish creatures from the Otherworld.
