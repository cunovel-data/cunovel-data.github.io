{"id":32140,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 8 AS A DREAM WHEN ONE AWAKETH.","content":"When, in due course of time, Bergan came partially to himself, he found that he was lying on his own bed, with the twilight shadows gathering duskily in its hangings. But his mind was too dull and confused to trouble itself with the question how he came there, notwithstanding that his ears seemed still to retain the sound of low voices, and his limbs the pressure of careful hands. Scarcely had he unclosed his heavy eyes, ere he was glad to shut them again, and to sink anew into slumber. \n \n But this time, it was not, as before, a profound stupor, a deaf, blind, torpid, state of nothingness. Though it lasted some hours, he never quite lost an oppressive sense of overhanging trouble, imperfectly as its nature was apprehended. Moreover, he was harassed by dreams of that most trying character, wherein varying images revolve around one fixed idea; combining the misery of continual change with that of ceaseless iteration into one intolerable horror. \n \n Breaking, at length, from the teasing spell of these phantasms, he saw that it was past midnight. Through the opposite window, he beheld a pale, waning moon, and, by its light, a gray, dimly-outlined landscape,—a faint and lifeless sketch, as it were, of a once bright, breathing world. While he looked, over it came the black shadow of a wind-driven cloud, blurring the lines, here and there, into still grayer indistinctness, sweeping across the lawn, mounting the steps of Bergan Hall, and laying, at last, its thin, light hand over his own brow and eyes. \n \n With it, as if by right of near kinship, a deep gloom fell upon his heart. Till now, it had not occurred to him why his head ached so heavily, nor what weary weight it was that burdened his mind. Yet he did not—as too many would have done, after a brief flush of shame, and a momentary feeling of regret—seek to throw off this burden by telling himself that his late aberration was, after all, a matter of small moment, since it was only what hundreds like him had done before, were now doing, and would continue to do till the end of time. Not of any such weak stuff, incapable of looking his own acts squarely in the face, and judging them according to their merits, was Bergan made. On the contrary, he felt as much humiliated as if he had been the first, last, only intoxicated young man in the universe. \n \n And this, be it understood, was not so much because he had violated the higher law, as because he had broken his own law unto himself. With the Bergan temper, he had also inherited a fair share of the Bergan pride, and the Bergan strength of will. But, softened and guided by home influences at once wise and genial, the one had hitherto shown itself mainly in a lofty, almost an ideal, purity of character, and the other had expended its force chiefly upon himself. The two, therefore, had served him little less effectually, in keeping him free from current vices, than higher motives might have done. He had taken a stern, proud pleasure in knowing that he wore no yoke but such as it pleased him deliberately to assume. He would have scorned to say, what he often heard from the lips of his fellows,—\"I cannot quit drinking, I cannot live without smoking, I cannot resist the fascinations of gambling,\" et c?tera;—he would have felt it a woful slur upon his manhood to avow himself so abject a slave to his animal nature. So strong was this pride of character, that no sooner did he feel any habit, any appetite, any pleasure, however innocent in itself, taking firm hold of him, than he was immediately impelled to give it up, to refuse it indulgence,—for a time, at least,—just to satisfy one part of himself that its control over the other and baser part was still perfect. At whatever price, he was determined to be his own master. \n \n It may be imagined, then, with what sharp sting of pride, what miserable sense of weakness and failure, he writhed, as Memory now flung open the doors of her silent gallery, and showed him sombre picture after picture, representing his own figure in divers humiliating positions. It shrank from the utterance of its strong convictions of right; it gave way to the assaults of a poor ambition; it drifted with circumstance; it was driven to and fro like a shuttlecock between outward temptation and inward passion; it was successively a fighting rowdy, a blind lunatic, an insensate drunkard. \n \n Not that these representations were all true in tone, unexaggerated in color, and correct in sentiment. Often, there is nothing more difficult than to fix upon the exact point where the plain boundary line between right and wrong was crossed; and neither pride nor remorse is apt to do it correctly. Some steps may have been taken upon a kind of debatable ground; had the march been arrested at any one of these, its tendency would have been different. In reviewing his conduct, Bergan failed to do justice either to his uncle\u0027s undeniable claims to his respectful consideration, up to the point where he had been required to follow him into a low bar-room, or to the real beauty and worth of some of his own feelings and motives. Looking back, he saw—or seemed to see—only a pitiable career of irresolution and moral cowardice, ending in disgrace. Covering his face with his hands, as if to shut out the unwelcome sight, he groaned aloud. \n \n To his surprise, the groan was distinctly prolonged and repeated. Was it the responsive wail of the ancestral spirits, mourning over their degenerate scion, or only the sympathizing echo of the ancestral walls? Springing to his feet, he beheld a tall, erect figure standing on the hearth, showing strangely weird and unearthly by the flickering blaze of a few dying embers. Not till it turned and came toward him did he recognize the dusky features and age-whitened hair of Maumer Rue. \n \n \"I hope that it is not on my account that you are up at this time of night,\" said he, gravely. \n \n \"You forget that night and day are both alike to me,\" she quietly answered. \"Are you better?\" \n \n \"Much better, thank you.\" And he added after a moment,—\"How came I here?\" \n \n \"Brick found you in the avenue. By my direction, you were brought in. At first, it was thought that you had been thrown from your horse, but—\" \n \n Rue paused. \n \n \"I understand,\" said Bergan, bitterly. \"I was drunk.\" \n \n Rue did not immediately answer. It was only after some moments that she said, earnestly;— \n \n \"Master Bergan, I am an old woman. I have seen four generations of your house,—I have nursed two,—and I have spent my life in its service. If it had been my own, I could not have loved it better, nor felt its welfare nearer my heart. If these things give me any right to say a word of warning to you, let me say it now!\" \n \n \"Say whatever seems good to you,\" replied Bergan, gloomily, as he flung himself into a chair. \"I doubt if you can say anything so hard to bear as what I have already said to myself.\" \n \n \"Is that so?\" asked Rue, in a tone of relief—\"is that really so? Then I need not say anything. It is a higher voice than mine that speaks within you; and my poor words would only weaken its effect. Only listen to it, Master Bergan, pray listen to it!\" she went on, with tears streaming from her blind eyes. \"If you stifle it now, it may never speak so clearly again!\" \n \n \"Make yourself easy, maumer,\" answered Bergan, much affected, yet doing his best to speak cheerfully,—\"I have not the least intention of stifling it. Moreover, I assure you that I am in no danger of repeating last night\u0027s miserable experience; drunkenness is not my besetting sin. I only wish I were as certain that I should never again give way to my temper.\" \n \n \"It has run in the blood a great while,\" remarked Rue, not without a certain respect for its length of pedigree; \"it will be hard to get it out.\" \n \n \"It shall be gotten out, though,\" responded Bergan, knitting his brows and setting his teeth with true hereditary doggedness. \n \n \"Very likely it may,\" replied Rue, quietly, \"if you take that tone. No doubt the Lord meant the Bergan will to conquer the Bergan temper—with His help. But I will not trouble you any longer, sir;—thank you for setting my mind at rest. And don\u0027t be offended if I recommend you not to come in your uncle\u0027s way this morning; give him a little time to get into a better mood. I will send your breakfast out to you.\" \n \n Bergan\u0027s brow darkened. \"I do not intend to come in his way,\" he answered a little shortly, \"neither this morning, nor at any other time. My visit here is at an end. I leave this house directly.\" \n \n \"Oh, Master Bergan, I beg you will not do that!\" exclaimed Rue. \"Your uncle really loves you in his heart; he will soon forget all about his anger.\" \n \n \"It is not because I dread his anger that I go,\" replied Bergan, gravely; \"it is because he has lowered me in my own eyes, and disgraced me in the eyes of others, in a way that I cannot forget. At least, not until I have proved to myself that I am neither a moral coward nor a miserable parasite, and to the world that drinking and fighting are not the essential conditions of my existence. I cannot well do either without leaving Bergan Hall. And I certainly shall not put myself in my uncle\u0027s way again, until he sees fit to apologize for what he did yesterday.\" \n \n \"Is the world turned upside down, then,\" asked Rue, with a kind of slow wonder, \"that an old uncle must apologize to a young nephew?\" \n \n Bergan colored, and the unwonted bitterness and irritation of his manner gave way before the force of the implied rebuke. \n \n \"Thank you,\" said he, almost in his natural tone, \"I see that I am—or, at least, that I was,—a little beside myself. Still, I must leave Bergan Hall. I cannot think it right or expedient to remain here longer. But when I have put myself in the way of living independently, and cleared up my reputation, I will do what I can, without loss of self-respect, to establish friendly relations with my uncle. Indeed, I do not mean to be foolishly resentful, nor unbecomingly exacting.\" \n \n \"May I ask what you are going to do?\" inquired Rue, after a few moments of thought. \n \n \"Certainly. I am going to carry out my original plan, and my mother\u0027s express wish, by opening a law-office in Berganton, and doing my best to win fame and fortune in the place which my ancestors founded; and in which,\" he added, with a smile, \"their shades may reasonably be expected to watch my career with especial interest, and also to do me a good turn, whenever they have it in their power.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Rue, after a long pause, \"perhaps you are right. I think I begin to see that it may be quite as well for you to go away, for a time. You shall not lose anything by it; I will take care of that. I have more influence with your uncle than you would think. And I promise you,—remember, I promise you,\" she repeated, with marked emphasis,—\"whatever comes, you shall have Bergan Hall.\" \n \n The young man shook his head. \"I think not,\" said he. \"Indeed, I have ceased to wish for it; I do not see any place for it in the life which I now contemplate. It was but a pleasant day-dream, at best; and it is over.\" \n \n \"It may be over for you,\" rejoined Rue, quietly, \"but it is not over for me. And my dreams are apt to come true. I may not live to see it,—indeed, it is borne in upon me that I shall not,—but the Hall will surely be yours, one day.\" \n \n Bergan again shook his head. Without making any pretensions to the prophetic gift, he thought he could foretell, better than old Rue, the effect of the course which he had marked out for himself, upon his uncle. But the blind woman could not see the gesture; and he forebore to put his doubt into words,—unless its subtle prompting was to be detected in his next apparently irrelevant sentence:— \n \n \"I shall think it one of my first duties to go and see my uncle Godfrey.\" \n \n \"I am glad to hear it,\" replied Rue, placidly. \"He is a wise, just man; and no doubt he will give you good advice about setting up your profession. I have been hoping that, through you, this long family breach would be healed.\" \n \n And here the conversation strayed off amid thick-growing family topics, where it is unnecessary to follow it. \n \n Gray dawn was in the east when, after a long, lingering look at the ancestral portraits, Bergan went out from the old Hall. He could scarcely believe that it was less than a week since he first entered it. He had passed there one of those crises of life which do the work of years. His short occupancy had left its indelible impress upon his character, for good or evil. \n \n Rue attended him to the door, and detained him for a moment on the threshold. \n \n \"If ever you are in need of a quiet place where you can feel perfectly at home,\" said she, \"come here. Your room shall always be ready for you; and you might stay here for weeks together, and no one be the wiser,—rarely does any one but me come inside the door. And if ever you should be in any trouble, or in any want, come and see what the old, blind woman can do for you; she may be better able to help you than you think. And now, good-bye, and God bless you, my dear young master—the future master of Bergan Hall!\" \n \n She raised her withered hands and sightless eyes to heaven, as she ended; and when Bergan looked back from the farther verge of the lawn, she was standing there still, in the dim dawn-light, a gray, venerable, ghostly figure, framed in his ancestral doorway, calling down blessings on his head. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59257.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
