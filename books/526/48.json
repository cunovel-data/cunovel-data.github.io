{"id":32178,"no":48,"title":"Chapter 10 LIKE A THIEF IN THE NIGHT.","content":"Bergan could not help wasting a little wonder on Doctor Remy\u0027s choice of the \"Rat-Hole\" as a place for transacting business, of whatever character. Yet the explanation was simple. The doctor was there, as he had stated, professionally. One of the habitués of the place had been severely wounded in an encounter with a policeman, some weeks before; and although he had succeeded in escaping unrecognized, the affair had made so much stir that his friends had not deemed it prudent to put him into the hands of any of the city physicians, for treatment. Doctor Remy had therefore been summoned from Berganton, and had not only conducted the case with his usual skill, but, foreseeing a possibility of turning the circumstance to future account, had won the ruffian\u0027s warmest gratitude by keeping his secret and declining any fee. Having thus gotten the run of the place, and the good will of its inmates, he had chosen it for the scene of his interviews with Dick Causton, because he had his own excellent reasons for not wishing these interviews to be seen or suspected by anybody in Berganton. And Dick made no objections, inasmuch as various small errands, which he dignified with the title of \"business,\" had taken him to Savalla, for two or three consecutive days; and the \"Rat-Hole\" was a convenient stopping-place, and, moreover, furnished liquor which had the two-fold merit of being of a better quality than any to be had at the \"Gregg Tavern,\" and of being quaffed at Doctor Remy\u0027s expense. Dick was not likely to trouble his head much about the character of any house possessing these strong recommendations. In regard to the signing of the fraudulent will, he had shown himself a little more scrupulous; his habit of intoxication had not yet accomplished its evil work of obliterating all sense of right, and every consideration of honor. At the first broaching of the subject, he had indignantly refused to listen to it for a moment. Later on—having apparently gotten some new lights on the question in the meantime—he had quietly suffered his objections to give way, one after another, to the doctor\u0027s arguments and bribes; to the great satisfaction of the latter, who found his task, on the whole, easier than he had expected. Yet he might have felt some misgivings, if he had followed Dick out of the house, immediately after the signing of the will, and heard the low, satisfied chuckle with which he tumbled into his superannuated chaise, and started his horse on a jog-trot toward Berganton. The potent draught just swallowed had as yet taken effect only in quickening his sense of the humorous, and putting him on excellent terms with his own self-conceit. His eyes twinkled with amusement, too intense to be denied the occasional vent of a loud burst of laughter, or an appropriate string of proverbs. \"Wer dem Spide zusicht, kann\u0027s am besten, my dear Doctor Remy,\" he muttered; \"or, in other words, the looker-on sees more of the game than the player. What would you give to know what I know, I wonder! Just wait till the right time comes; then you\u0027ll find out that \u0027He is worst cheated, who cheats himself.\u0027\" A mile further on, his potations beginning to make themselves felt, he suddenly broke out, with a tipsy laugh and leer;—\"\u0027Man kan ei drage haardt med brudet Reb,\u0027 mine excellent doctor,—you cannot haul hard with a broken rope! Ha! ha!\" And, although his shamefaced flight from Bergan\u0027s presence, on the second day, may seem to indicate that he was not quite certain of the uprightness of all his acts and motives, no sooner was he fairly on the road to Berganton than he began to chuckle again. Bergan, meanwhile, was questioning within himself whether he ought not to make known Unwick\u0027s story to Major Bergan. He hesitated only because he foresaw that the information might possibly be set down to his self-interest, rather than his desire to serve his uncle. Nevertheless, it did not take him long to decide that he must do what he knew to be the right thing, regardless of consequences. Nor was it certain that his uncle would misconstrue his motives:—not long since, he had received an intimation from Rue that he was sure to meet with a cordial reception whenever he could make it convenient to visit Berganton; the Major\u0027s anger having so completely wasted away under the double attrition of time and favorable report,—not to mention her own steady influence in his behalf,—that he had lately expressed a wish to see him. There was really no good reason, therefore, why he should hesitate to present himself at the Hall, except that the whole neighborhood was certain to bristle with unpleasant recollections. However, he must face them some time, and as well now as ever. Still, as nightfall was at hand, and he knew of no reason for hurry, he thought it expedient to postpone the visit till the morrow. He would ride over to the Hall, he thought, betimes in the morning. Having made his arrangements accordingly, and committed his office to Hubert\u0027s care, he retired early, and soon forgot the fatigues and excitements of the day in a profound sleep. He had not slept long, however, before he woke from a dream—wherein Doctor Remy figured as an iconoclast, overthrowing and demolishing the ancient gods of Bergan Hall—to the consciousness that some one was knocking loudly at his door. \"Who is there?\" he called. \"It\u0027s me, Massa Harry,\" responded a voice, with the unmistakable negro intonation; but, nevertheless, a voice too much disconnected with the present to meet with immediate recognition from his but half-awakened faculties. \"Who is \u0027me\u0027?\" he demanded again. \"You\u0027s own boy Brick, Massa Harry,\" was the reply. With an instant intuition of evil, Bergan sprang out of bed, and opened the door. \"What is the matter?\" he asked. \"Oh, Massa Harry! ole massa\u0027s dyin\u0027,\" replied Brick; \"an\u0027 gramma Rue, she sent me for you to come right off\u0027; she say,—\u0027Tell him to ride fast, dere\u0027s not a minit to lose.\u0027 An\u0027 I\u0027se brought Vic \u0027long for you; an\u0027 while you\u0027s a-dressin\u0027, I\u0027ll jes\u0027 go an\u0027 give her a drink, an\u0027 rub her down a lilly bit, so she\u0027ll be right smart and fresh when you\u0027s ready to start.\" It was one o\u0027clock in the morning when Bergan saw the great dusky pile of the Hall, and the dark masses of the live oaks, rise before him, in the pale light of the waning moon. He knew that its master lay within. Brick had narrated how Rue had ordered and superintended his removal thither, in one of his moments of comparative quiet and exhaustion;—the old woman being of the opinion that it was not fitting for him to die otherwhere than under the ancestral roof, in the same room where one after another of his forefathers had likewise laid down the burden of the flesh, and begun the new life of the spirit. To this room, Bergan was easily guided by his groans and cries. Never before had he seen a man in the terrible grasp of delirium tremens; and now, after a brief look, he was glad to turn away his eyes. Major Bergan was on the bed, but he was only held there by the main strength of two stout negroes. A frightful spasm contorted his face and twisted his limbs. Great drops of perspiration stood on his brow; and from his mouth flowed a mingled stream of oaths, curses, shrieks of horror, threats of defiance, and groans of agony. His bodily anguish was only less than his mental torture. His eyes started from his head at the phantom-creations of his delirious imagination. The furniture was alive, watching him with fiery eyes, and threatening him with envenomed teeth and claws; the shadows took mocking shapes and gibed and jeered at him; and the pictures were demons setting them all on. The very hairs of his head turned to slimy snakes, and the bed-clothes were now damp winding-sheets, and now devouring flames. \"Have you had a doctor?\" asked Bergan of Rue, who had met him at the door. \"Yes; Doctor Remy has been here twice; he left not much more than half an hour ago. He said he had a critical case on hand, that must be seen to; and there was nothing to be done here, except what we could do as well as he.\" \"What are you doing?\" \"Giving him soup to keep up his strength, and opium to quiet him. A few minutes ago, too, in a lucid moment, he called for some powders that he has been in the habit of taking, which, he said, always did him more good than anything else. There were only two left; we gave him one, as he was so bent on having it; I thought if it did no good, it couldn\u0027t do any harm.\" \"Did Doctor Remy say that he would call again?\" \"He did, but, Master Bergan, a blind woman\u0027s ears are quick at catching meanings as well as words, and he did not mean to come very soon,—not, I reckon, till all is over.\" Bergan meditated. Though he had long known that his uncle\u0027s habits would be likely to bring him, sooner or later, to a drunkard\u0027s most miserable end, he could not but think it somewhat suspicious that the seizure should have followed so closely upon the completion of the fraudulent will. \"When was my uncle taken?\" he asked. \"Early this evening. He had been drinking a good deal for two or three days past; he said he did not feel well, and he would keep at the brandy bottle, in spite of all that I could say to him. About ten o\u0027clock this morning, Doctor Remy came in to see him, and I suspect, told him something that made him angry,—for I heard him swearing furiously to himself, after the doctor had gone. And then, probably, he fell to drinking worse than ever; but it was not until about four o\u0027clock that I heard him groaning and crying out, and he has kept it up a good part of the time ever since. But now, I think, he seems to be getting a little easier.\" Bergan turned to the bed. The spasm was over, and the Major lay exhausted, with his eyes closed. Opening them, they immediately brightened with a look of recognition. \"Is that you, Harry?\" he asked, feebly. \"Yes, uncle,\" replied Bergan, taking his hand; \"Rue sent for me, and I came at once. I am sorry to see you so ill.\" \"I think you are, my boy, I think you are,\" responded Major Bergan; \"you look like it, and besides, a Bergan never lies. And I\u0027m sorry, too,—all the more, because I suspect that it\u0027s my own fault. If ever you learn to drink—and I don\u0027t feel quite so sure that it\u0027s necessary as I did once—don\u0027t drink too hard, Harry, don\u0027t drink too hard! If ever I get over this bout, I swear I\u0027ll think twice, hereafter, before I drink once. And if I don\u0027t, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here, Harry, boy; it\u0027s well for the new master to be on before the old one is off.\" \"I hope that you will live to carry your good resolutions into effect,\" said Bergan earnestly. \"Do you? Well, so do I.\" He lay quiet for a moment, busy with his own thoughts. All at once he started up, exclaiming;— \"Fire and fury! what\u0027s that?\" The negroes caught hold of him, expecting a fresh convulsion of the same nature as the preceding ones; but, though his face was frightfully distorted, and his form writhed with pain, there was no accompaniment of phantasmal horrors. \"Brandy!\" he finally gasped, through his set teeth. Rue motioned to one of the women in waiting to bring some. Bergan put his hand on her arm. \"Surely you will not give it to him now,\" said he, impressively. \"The doctor said he must have a little, now and then,\" she answered. But before the glass could be put to his lips, he groaned, shuddered from head to foot, and fell back on the pillow, with his eyes rolled up in his head, his hands clenched, and a dark froth issuing from, between his shut teeth. He was dead.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59295.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
