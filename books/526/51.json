{"id":32181,"no":51,"title":"Chapter 2 SWIFT FEET.","content":"However cold a man\u0027s temperament may be by nature, however complete the subjection of his passions to his reason and his will, he is nearly certain, in the sudden excitement and confusion of detected guilt, to be betrayed into some act instantly condemned by his better judgment. Such had been the case with Doctor Remy, in his encounter with Hubert Arling at the \"Rat-Hole.\" Mistaking Hubert for Bergan, and believing him to be there only to spy out his actions and thwart his designs, it had been his first impulse to draw the pistol, which he habitually carried, according to the custom of the times and locality, and free himself at once and forever from interference that he conceived to be so dangerous. His chagrin at finding that he had mistaken one brother for the other, was only equalled by his surprise at his calm dismissal and friendly warning, at Bergan\u0027s hands. It did not take him long to fix upon the hidden motive of this conduct,—to decide, with a bitter smile, that he had been spared for the sake of Carice. Yet he had no idea of the extent of Bergan\u0027s forbearance toward him on this head. It must be remembered that he never received the slightest intimation of Doctor Trubie\u0027s suspicions, or of Bergan\u0027s visit to Oakstead, on the night of the wedding. Godfrey Bergan had omitted any mention of either; first, because he had been prevented from doing so by the overwhelming distress and anxiety that had come upon him so suddenly; and afterward, because it had seemed wiser, on the whole, to say nothing. Doctor Remy, therefore, had no suspicion of the mine over which he had been standing, on that night, nor how its explosion had been averted. From his point of view, Bergan\u0027s sudden removal to Savalla, in consideration of the prospect there opened to him, was the most natural thing in the world. Nor did he know any reason why himself and his former friend should not meet on the old terms, upon occasion, except that the gain of the one had been the loss of the other, in respect to Carice. Even here, however, he held himself to be ostensibly blameless, inasmuch as womankind was proverbially fickle, and Bergan had no reason to suppose that he was aware of any relation between him and Carice other than the outward one. He deeply regretted, therefore, that in a moment of surprise and confusion, he should have put himself in a false position. It would have been far better to have met Bergan with the careless ease of a conscience void of offence. But, since he had not done so, it was well that Carice was his sufficient safeguard against retaliation. Yet one word had fallen from Bergan\u0027s lips, which had startled him at the moment, and haunted him on his way homeward. The young man had seriously bidden him be thankful that he was saved from \"another crime.\" Was the phrase accidental, or did it imply some knowledge of the affair of the will? In the latter case, was it likely that Bergan would submit to the loss of what he had been encouraged, at one time, to consider his lawful inheritance, without a most rigid scrutiny and investigation of the document by which, while the property was apparently given to Carice, it was done in such a way as to place it absolutely in her husband\u0027s control. Would Bergan\u0027s forbearance toward her and hers be likely to extend as far as this? Judging by himself, and his experience of men in general, and especially of heirs, he did not hesitate to affirm that it would not. For, though Bergan had seemed to be possessed of some unusually Quixotic notions of honor, independence, and disinterestedness, during the period of their intimate association, he had doubtless seen enough of life since then, to grow more sensible. What, then, had he not to dread from his natural acuteness and legal skill, when both of these, sharpened by interest, should be brought to bear on the false will? Absorbed in these reflections, he had allowed his horse to choose his own pace, which had gradually slackened, from a gallop to a trot, and then into a walk, until, at last, he was easily overtaken by Dick Causton, in whose eyes there still shone a humorous twinkle. \"Those Arlings seem to be pretty much of a piece,\" said he; \"they both give better than they take, when it comes to blows. However, the Italians say, Tutto s\u0027accommoda, eccetto l\u0027osso del collo,—that means, Everything can be mended except the neck-bone. Yours has come safe out of this fray, but there\u0027s no telling how long \u0027twill stay so, if you\u0027re so ready with your pistol.\" \"Pshaw!\" exclaimed Doctor Remy, angrily. \"I am in no mood for jesting. Do you suppose that Arling got any clue to our business in that den?\" \"How should he?—\u0027A man doesn\u0027t look behind the door unless he has been there himself.\u0027 Besides, Mr. Arling minds his own business,—which I wish I did!—then I shouldn\u0027t have run from him like a dog caught stealing. By the way, Doctor, if the Major makes another will, which cuts the throat of this one of ours, I suppose the forgery goes for nothing?\" Doctor Remy looked at him darkly. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"Is he thinking of making another?\" \"Not that I know of,\" replied Dick. \"But, \u0027At the game\u0027s end, see who wins.\u0027 There is time for him to make a dozen before he dies.\" \"We will see about that!\" muttered the doctor. \"And if he does,\" persisted Dick, \"our will goes for naught, of course,—won\u0027t even be looked at, I suppose. They\u0027ll \u0027trust to the label of the bag,\u0027 seeing there\u0027s no necessity for opening it!\" Doctor Remy stopped short, and eyed his companion suspiciously, \"See here, Dick,\" said he, in a low, determined tone, \"you had better not venture to try any double dealing with me. I will have you to know that I can put you in prison, any day; and I will do it, too, even though I have to go along with you, if you falter one step in the course I have marked out for you. Having begun with me in this business, you will find it for your interest, in more senses than one, to help me through with it.\" \"That is to say,\" muttered Dick, ruefully, \"Die met den duivel ingescheept is, moet met hem overvaren,—Having embarked with the Devil, you have got to sail with him.\" The sound of that word \"prison\" was by no means agreeable in his ears. He had all a vagabond\u0027s love for open air and sunshine, and liberty to go and come at his own fitful will. He sickened at the bare idea of prison walls between him and the sky, prison bars between him and the fresh, roving air, prison restraints upon his freedom of action. Doctor Remy saw the impression that he had made, and proceeded:—\"Wherefore, if you hear, or have heard, the Major express any intention of making a new will, I need not suggest the propriety of your giving me immediate warning.\" The form of the sentence was that of an assertion, but the tone was interrogative. \"Dictum sapienti sat est,\" answered Dick, sulkily, denying himself the pleasure of translating, and immediately closing his lips tight, as if he dared not trust himself to say another word. In this mood, Doctor Remy thought it better not to press him further. He had been made to see that he was in his power, and had even yielded a reluctant assent to his will; this was gain enough for the present. So, having reached the point where the roads diverged, he bade Dick a smiling \"Good-day,\" turned off toward the Hall; which, it occurred to him, it might be worth while to visit, for the chance of securing useful shreds of information, or of substituting the false will for the true one. Dick Causton looked after him with a moody, discontented brow. \"I am like a leek, a gray head, and all the rest green,\" he groaned to himself. \"I thought I had made a mighty sharp bargain, but it turns out that I\u0027ve only sold myself to the Devil, to fetch and carry at his bidding. I really gave myself credit for more sense; but, Do entra beber, sale saber, When the drink\u0027s in, the wit\u0027s out.\" With the last words, Dick heaved a deep sigh. It was nothing new to find that his darling sin was an inclined plane, down which he continually slid into the grasp of divers other sins, less to his taste; but never before had it done him so unkind a trick as to fling him into the hands of a man quick to see, and unscrupulous to use, the chance of turning him to account. Yet so completely had all courage and energy of will died out of him, and so thoroughly was he scared at the idea of a prison as a possible termination of his career, that he dared propose to himself only a feeble and covert resistance to Doctor Remy\u0027s stern domination. There was present safety in outward submission; and as for the future!—he smiled in spite of his discomfiture. At the Hall, Doctor Remy was a little startled to find Major Bergan in the clutch of so severe an attack of delirium tremens that death was likely to be the speedy result. It did not suit his plans that the Major\u0027s decease should follow so quickly upon the completion of the forged will; he wanted a little more time to mark out and make smooth his future course, and obliterate his more recent track. He therefore set to work, with right good will, and science considerably in advance of the times, to strengthen and quiet his patient, and so prolong his life; certain that, whenever the strong hand of medical authority was withdrawn, he would immediately drink himself into a relapse, which could be allowed to prove fatal. His efforts were not without a measure of success; in three hours, he had so far reduced the fever and excitement that he ventured to leave Rue in charge, while he paid a brief visit to another patient, who had sent for him four or five times during the evening. This desertion of his post was fatal to him. In spite of Rue\u0027s best endeavors, Major Bergan succeeded in getting possession of the brandy bottle, and draining it to the last drop. When Doctor Remy returned, it was to find him once more a raving maniac, and to learn to his consternation, that Bergan had been sent for. The Major would die, there was no help for that; but something must be done to prevent the arrival of his nephew until after the true will—and all other wills—had been found and destroyed, and the false one put in its place;—even, if possible, until after the funeral was over, the will read, and the property put into his own hands. Once in possession, he had reason to believe that he could not, or would not, be disturbed. His stay at the Major\u0027s bedside was short, and principally spent in profound meditation; which was set down by the lookers-on to the account of his deep solicitude for the patient. His course was soon decided upon. In less than two hours he was back at the Rat-Hole, in deep conversation with the convalescent, who was known as \"Big Ben.\" Its purport may be gathered from the closing remarks. \"You hit pretty hard, I suppose,\" said the doctor. \"Looks like it, don\u0027t it?\" returned Big Ben, holding up his great fist for inspection, with a satisfied smile. \"Make yourself easy; yonder lawyer won\u0027t trouble you with any cross-questions for a month to come, I\u0027ll promise you that. He won\u0027t know his head from a bread-and-milk poultice to-morrow morning, if he ever does.\" \"Take care!\" replied the doctor, warningly; \"you know I don\u0027t want him killed,—only laid up for two or three weeks, and indisposed to meddle with other people\u0027s affairs.\" Big Ben smiled grimly. \"I\u0027ll take care not to do more than stun him, on your account, doctor,\" he answered; \"but I don\u0027t say what I shall do, on my brother\u0027s. A fellow don\u0027t always weight his blows exactly to suit the skull they hit; and if I should happen to put an end to him, without meaning it, you wouldn\u0027t take it much to heart, would ye?\" Doctor Remy did not move a muscle of his face, but his eyes sparkled, in spite of himself. Ben laughed, and nodded his head. \"Don\u0027t trouble yerself to answer,\" said he; \"I understand you well enough without.\" \"But, Ben—\" began the doctor, in a tone of remonstrance. \"Enough said,\" interrupted the ruffian, impatiently. \"If it\u0027s me you\u0027re afeard for, I\u0027ll jest let you know that I\u0027ve got everything fixed to leave these parts, to-morrow morning—I\u0027ve heard of a better opening for my talents—so I shall be off before this affair leaks out. As for you, who knows that you\u0027ve got anything to do with it? It\u0027s jest our own private squarin\u0027 of accounts; that\u0027s all. You saved my life; I squelch this lawyer for you. At the same time I settle up with him, for my brother. If I swing for\u0027t, I\u0027m not such a scoundrel as to bring you in. Now, I\u0027m off; there\u0027s scant time to fix things, and get to the Hall by day-break. It\u0027s too late, you think, to stop him on the way?\" \"Most certainly; he must have started before this.\" \"And his room is on the south-east corner, you say?\" \"Yes, with windows opening on the second piazza.\" However,—thanks to Carice,—the room was empty when Big Ben and his companion looked into it. Determined not to be baffled thus, he prowled around the house, until he was detected by Rue\u0027s quick ears in the hall, and asked what was his business; when he truthfully replied that he was seeking for Mr. Arling. Hearing this, Doctor Gerrish came forward, stated where Bergan could probably be found, and entrusted Ben with the message, which, as we have seen, was scrupulously delivered. Bergan was then knocked down; and the inanimate body was dragged by the two ruffians to what seemed to be a remote point of the Oakstead grounds, where it would not be likely to be discovered for some hours, perhaps days. There, Ben debated within himself, for a minute, whether he would leave it its small remaining chance of life; but he remembered that Bergan had seen both himself and his comrade face to face, and would be able to identify them, on occasion. He drew his knife, muttered, \"Dead men tell no tales,\" and sheathed it in the young man\u0027s breast. As he stood upright, his ear caught the faint jar of a closing door, followed by the sound of slow footsteps, and a cracked voice humming a song. Apparently, the spot which he had chosen, lonely as it seemed, was not far from some human dwelling. He and his companion exchanged startled glances, plunged into the underbrush, and fled silently and swiftly.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59298.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
