{"id":32153,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 12 A CONSULTATION.","content":"Plainly, Mrs. Bergan had something on her mind, that bright spring morning. Though she poured her husband\u0027s second cup of coffee with a deliberation that seemed to promise much for its flavor, he was fain to send it back, after tasting it, with the explanatory remark:— \"You have forgotten to smile into it, my dear; it is not sweet enough.\" \"Eh!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bergan, absently, extending her hand toward the cream pitcher. \"I doubt if cream will mend the matter much,\" observed Mr. Bergan, gravely. \"A lump of sugar might do, if the smile be absolutely non est.\" Mrs. Bergan\u0027s mind having by this time returned to the business in hand, both sugar and smile were immediately forthcoming, in sufficient measure to threaten the coffee with excess of sweets. Nevertheless, she continued to have fits of abstraction, at short intervals, until the breakfast things had been removed, and Carice had quitted the room. Then, she turned to her husband with a serious face. \"I really think, Godfrey,\" she began, \"that we owe your nephew some attention.\" \"Of what kind, pray?\" inquired Mr. Bergan, in considerable surprise. \"Well, it seems to me that we ought,—once, at least,—to invite him formally to dinner.\" \"Pray, what has he been doing, to place us under such an obligation?\" asked Mr. Bergan, somewhat dryly. Mrs. Bergan colored slightly. \"I am afraid that we made a mistake at the outset,\" said she. \"Of course, the attention was due to him then as much as now.\" \"I thought we agreed that the less Carice saw of him, the better,\" replied Mr. Bergan. \"Yes, I know. But that was because we believed him to be of intemperate habits.\" Men of Godfrey Bergan\u0027s thoughtful and deliberate character, when they adopt a mistaken opinion, are wont to wedge it in so firmly among things undeniably true and just, that to dislodge it is like tearing up an oak which has rooted itself in a rock cleft. \"I wish I were certain that he is not,\" he answered, with a slow, grave shake of the head. Mrs. Bergan gave him a surprised look. \"I don\u0027t see why you should doubt him,\" said she. \"Everybody agrees that a more correct young man does not exist. He is always to be found in his office during office hours, attends Church regularly on Sundays, as well as at most of the occasional services, goes into but little society, and that of the very best,—what more would you have?\" \"Nothing,\" replied her husband, \"except the certainty that it will last. A drunkard\u0027s reform is so rarely a permanent thing, that one is justified in distrusting it. Though he may keep as sober as a Carthusian monk for a few months, or even for a year or two, his unhappy appetite is only a caged lion: in the first unguarded moment, it is certain to break out, and to sweep everything before it—resolution, hope, energy, and promise. Unfortunately for my nephew, perhaps, but very fortunately for ourselves, I fancy, I happen to retain a distinct recollection of my first meeting with him.\" \"But,\" urged Mrs. Bergan, \"I thought Carice told you what your brother Harry said about that matter.\" \"With all due respect for my brother Harry,\" returned her husband, coolly, \"I don\u0027t consider his testimony, in this matter, to be worth much. Intemperance is, in his estimation, so very venial a sin,—not to say, so very Berganly a virtue,—that he would be sure to extenuate it, if he could.\" \"He would never say what was not true,\" affirmed Mrs. Bergan, decidedly. \"No, but he would look at the affair from his own point of view, and speak accordingly.\" \"But your nephew left him on account of that very affair,\" persisted Mrs. Bergan, \"and has refused to have anything to do with him since, even with Bergan Hall held out to him as a bait.\" \"In which,\" rejoined Mr. Bergan, composedly, \"he shows that he has more of the hereditary temper than is good for him, or any one connected with him. It is the same trait that has made Harry so bitter against us, all these years. And one feud in the family was enough—and too much.\" Mrs. Bergan began to look annoyed. While she admitted the general truth of her husband\u0027s observations, she had an intuitive conviction of their present misapplication. Her womanly instincts were all in Bergan\u0027s favor. But that, she knew, was no ground of effective argument. Her husband looked at her clouded face, for a moment, and then went to her side. \"Confess now, Clarissa,\" said he, pleasantly, laying his hand on her shoulder, \"that our nephew\u0027s claims upon our attention would never have presented themselves so strongly to your mind, were it not for his late brilliant hit in the court room, and the sudden admiration and popularity which it has won him.\" A slight flush showed on Mrs. Bergan\u0027s cheek; nevertheless, she met her husband\u0027s eyes frankly. \"I acknowledge that those things had their effect in making me ashamed of myself,\" she answered. \"But, all the time, I have had an uneasy feeling that we were not doing our duty by your sister\u0027s son. Surely, we ought to have been the very last persons to have listened to, and acted upon, a rumor unfavorable to him; or, if it were certain that he had made a false step, we should have been ready with our influence and countenance, to help him to retrieve himself.\" \"You forget, my dear,\" said Mr. Bergan, gently, \"that it was for Carice\u0027s sake. We were thinking only of her.\" \"And so we did evil that good might come,\" returned his wife, somewhat ruefully. \"But evil follows the universal law, and brings forth after its kind.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Bergan, looking both surprised and puzzled. Mrs. Bergan smiled at him half-pityingly, half-sarcastically. \"Oh, ye men!\" she exclaimed, \"if ye are wise as serpents, in matters of the intellect, ye are blind as bats, in matters of the heart.\" \"I am ready to admit the truth of the abstract proposition,\" said Mr. Bergan, quizzically, \"as soon as I am made to understand in what way I furnish a proof of it.\" \"Don\u0027t you see,\" returned Mrs. Bergan, seriously, \"that if ever Carice is to become over-interested in Bergan, now is the time,—now that he is presented to her imagination in the attractive light of a long neglected and misunderstood, but patient, persevering, and, finally, all-conquering hero?\" Mr. Bergan looked as if he did see—several things. \"Is that the reason why you propose to throw them together?\" he asked, dryly. \"Certainly,\" replied Mrs. Bergan, with perfect composure. \"The first thing is to destroy the halo with which he is now surrounded, by bringing him into the disenchanting daylight of commonplace, everyday association. Next, we must rob him of the crown of martyrdom, so far as we are concerned, by frankly confessing that we were a little too severe upon him at first, and by doing full justice to his talents in a matter-of-fact way. Finally, we must make the most of the relationship.\" \"You may be right,\" said Mr. Bergan, after some moments of deep thought. \"Though, at first sight, it looks very much like jumping into the river, to avoid the rain.\" \"My dear,\" replied Mrs. Bergan, earnestly, \"we cannot keep them apart, if we would, as matters are now turning. Twice already, we have met him at dinner parties, where he is the lion of the hour, and everybody makes much of him but ourselves; and we shall continue to do so, until the round is finished. It must be confessed that he wears his honors modestly; at times, I cannot help feeling proud of him myself.\" \"I never doubted his ability, nor overlooked his pleasing manners,\" said Mr. Bergan. \"But what are they but gems on a poisoned cup, if the virus of intemperance be in his blood, or his principles be unsound?\" \"The latter can hardly be the case,\" remarked Mrs. Bergan, \"if the report be true that he refuses to have anything to do with a cause that he does not believe to be just. That seems to argue uncommon strength of principle.\" \"I am not so sure about that,\" returned Mr. Bergan, shaking his head dubiously. \"Most people, I find, regard it as one of the many eccentricities of genius. Others think he only showed his shrewdness in declining to undertake a cause that he was sure to lose, after his brilliant victory in the case of Corlew vs. Kenan. Besides, he has not announced that such is to be his settled course of action. And if he did, it would seem arrogant, in so young a man. It is, in fact, judging the cause before it is tried.\" \"It strikes me that a man must needs judge things beforehand, where his own conscience is concerned,\" observed Mrs. Bergan, thoughtfully. \"You would not expect him to act first, and decide afterward whether he had done right or wrong.\" \"In judging his own actions, he need not judge those of his fellows,\" replied Mr. Bergan, somewhat magisterially. His wife could not help wondering within herself how such judgment could well be avoided, where a course of action was involved. But she wisely forbore to press the point, and reverted to the main argument. \"At all events,\" said she, \"if he gets to visit here frequently and familiarly, we shall have an opportunity of seeing for ourselves what his character really is. He may prove to be everything that is safe and admirable; or he and Carice may never think of each other in the way that we are contemplating. And, after all, I think we might trust our daughter; she has never shown herself silly or wilful; she is not likely to despise our judgment, or disregard our wishes.\" \"All the more reason why we should do our whole duty by her,\" rejoined Mr. Bergan, \"in the way of prevention as well as cure. In such matters, parental commands generally come too late to forestall mischief; the most that they do is to prevent it from going any farther.\" \"True,\" replied Mrs. Bergan, quietly. \"And I confess that I might have been more puzzled what to do, if,\"—Mrs. Bergan made a slight pause, to give her words the greater effect (like a wise woman, she had kept her strongest argument until the last),—\"if I were not tolerably certain that he is already engaged—or, at least, likely to become so—to Astra Lyte.\" \"That alters the case, indeed,\" said Mr. Bergan, thoughtfully. \"But what reason have you for thinking so?\" \"Miss Ferrars was here last evening, and she told me—in confidence, you know—that she had no doubt of it whatever. Her window overlooks Astra\u0027s studio, and she says that she often sees him there, helping Astra about her work, or watching her with the most absorbing interest, or talking to her with a very tell-tale earnestness.\" \"It would hardly be received as evidence in a court of justice,\" said Mr. Bergan, smiling, \"though it sounds suggestive. But Miss Ferrars is given to gossip—\u0027in confidence,\u0027 as you say.\" His wife laughed. \"Of course she is; else I should never have heard of this pleasant probability. For both pleasant and probable it certainly is. Astra is turning out a wonderfully fine, talented girl; and she and Mrs. Lyte have been Bergan\u0027s fast friends and defenders, all along. How can he show his gratitude more gracefully than by marrying her?\" \"Does Carice know of this?\" asked Mr. Bergan, after a moment. \"Yes; Miss Ferrars told me in her presence, and greatly shocked her by doing so. She thinks it wrong to connect names so carelessly.\" \"She is right,\" said Mr. Bergan, emphatically. \"At the same time,\" continued Mrs. Bergan, \"she remarked, that it would be a very nice thing, if it were only true. And afterward she said that she would like to renew her acquaintance with Astra;—you remember that the two were very good child-friends, though circumstances have kept them apart, of late,—as they have their mothers! I really feel guilty when I think how fond I used to be of Catherine Lyte, and how I have allowed her to slip out of my life. But then, we were both invalids, for many years, with scarce strength enough for home cares, and not a jot for friendship or society. Still, I have all my old regard for her carefully buried in my heart, like the talent in the parable; intact, if not in a way to increase. One of these days, I mean to dig it up, and go with Carice to pay her a visit, and take a look at the wonders of Astra\u0027s studio.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Mr. Bergan. \"Well! I suppose the conclusion of the whole matter is, that we are to give Bergan a dinner, and the freedom of the house.\" \"Precisely,\" replied Mrs. Bergan, nodding her head. \"And now, I want to consult you about the invitation list.\" Mr. Bergan rose hastily. \"I am quite content to leave that to you, my dear.\" His wife caught his arm, \"You are not going to shirk the responsibility in that way,\" she said, decidedly. \"I really want your advice. Am I to ask Dr. Remy?\" \"Why not?\" \"I don\u0027t quite like the man.\" \"I cannot see what you have against him, unless it be that he was not born in the county, and you don\u0027t know his whole pedigree.\" Mrs. Bergan did not answer. She knew her dislike to be a case of spontaneous generation, and not at all qualified to give a lucid account of itself. \"Besides,\" continued her husband, \"he is Bergan\u0027s particular friend.\" \"Is he?\" asked Mrs. Bergan, innocently. \"I did not know that he was anybody\u0027s friend.\" \"Clarissa!\" exclaimed Mr. Bergan, rebukingly. \"I never heard Dr. Remy speak ill of anybody, in all my acquaintance with him.\" \"Did you ever hear him speak well of anybody?\" responded Mrs. Bergan,—\"well enough, that is, to give you new interest, faith, delight, in the person of whom he spoke? On the contrary, does he not somehow manage to chill what you have?\" \"I cannot say that he talks of his friends with the warm effusion of a woman,\" answered Mr. Bergan, sarcastically. \"But only with the cold malice of a man,\" retorted Mrs. Bergan. \"There! a truce! He shall come, if only to prove what I have said. Next, I want to invite Mrs. Lyte and Astra.\" \"Very well.\" \"And Mr. Islay, and Judge and Mrs. Morris, and—\" \"You have seven already,\" interrupted Mr. Bergan, \"making ten with ourselves; which I hold to be the magic number for a dinner party. If you want to invite anybody else, better wait till another time.\" Mrs. Bergan was wise enough to be the bearer of her own invitation to Mrs. Lyte; else it would scarcely have been accepted. The latter had lost the taste for society with the habit of it; nothing short of the personal solicitation of her old friend, now asking it as a favor to herself, and now urging it for Astra\u0027s sake, would have induced her to give up, even for a few hours, the seclusion that had slowly been transformed, for her as for most invalids, from a grievous necessity into a calm pleasantness. Thus far, Mrs. Bergan was successful. But she missed seeing either Astra or Bergan; both happened to be out, on their respective ways. As regarded the former, it did not much matter; but she was sorry not to see Bergan, and utter the few graceful words of apology for the past, as well as of promise for the future, wherewith she had intended to preface her invitation to dinner, and inaugurate her new policy. As it was, she could only leave a pencilled note of invitation on his desk, and reserve her explanation for a personal interview. Then she went back to the studio, where she admired everything cordially, and with wonderful impartiality. Carice, meanwhile, was hanging over the winged cherub, with a deep, silent delight that went to Mrs. Lyte\u0027s heart. \"You will take such pleasure in meeting her again!\" she said to Astra, when she came in, a few moments after the visitors had gone. \"She is just the friend that you need.\" \"I am not so sure about that!\" returned Astra wilfully. \"I sometimes catch a glimpse of her at church; and she looks a great deal too soft and dainty and delicate for a friend. If I were a Roman Catholic, I might set her up in a corner, and worship her as a madonna, or a saint. But, being a Protestant, I really don\u0027t see that I have any need of her,—or she, indeed, of me!\" Mrs. Lyte shook her head in mild reproof. \"You do say such strange things, Astra,\" said she, \"things so liable to be misunderstood.\" \"You do not misunderstand them, mamma,\" returned Astra, fondly. \"No, but Mr. Arling might.\" Astra turned, in surprise, and met Bergan\u0027s quiet smile. He had come in just behind her, and had heard almost the whole. \"I think not,\" said Astra, coolly. \"Mr. Arling is pretty well used to my ways, by this time. We were speaking,\" she continued, \"of that ineffable combination of snow and sunshine, lily and rose, saint and angel, known among mortals by the name of Carice Bergan. Can you even imagine being on familiar terms with her? Or would you if you could? Does she not seem fitter for a pedestal or a shrine,—some place a little above, or remote from, life\u0027s ordinary round?\" \"She does, indeed,\" replied Bergan, earnestly. \"There is a half-unearthly purity about her, that keeps even one\u0027s thoughts at a reverent distance. Snow and sunshine!—yes, she has something of both, a kind of soft, white chill, interfused with a rich brightness, half-golden, half roseate;—but it is impossible to put the idea into words!\" And Bergan turned, musingly, toward his office door. Astra looked after him, for a moment, and then glanced smilingly at her mother. \"Fortunately, there are such things as household divinities,\" said she. \"Eh?\" said Mrs. Lyte, wonderingly. But Astra did not explain.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59270.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
