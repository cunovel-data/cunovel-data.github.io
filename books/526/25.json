{"id":32155,"no":25,"title":"PART THIRD. THE IN-GATHERING. Chapter 1 UNFOLDINGS.","content":"Spring was abroad in the land. No one could tell just when she had stolen into the woods and gardens, and begun her pleasant labors, but there was no question about the fact of her presence and industry. Everywhere, there were the tender green of newborn foliage, and the varied odors of opening buds and blossoms. The new leaves of the ilex trees had quietly pushed off the old ones. The hedges were thick-sown with the white stars of the Cherokee rose. The passion-vine trailed its purple garments along the fences. Houstonias spread a soft blue haze over the grass. Wild plum and cherry trees flung drifts of fragrant snow along the road side. The air was faint with perfume from the ivory censers of the magnolia, swinging dreamily overhead. Wherever a vine could cling and climb, there was a seemingly miraculous outburst of foliage and flowers; every dry stick and stem became a leafy thyrsus, every crumbling stump a green and garlanded altar. \n \n Mrs. Lyte\u0027s great, irregular thicket of a garden was quick to feel the genial influence, and to twine and twist itself into a denser tangle than ever. Rose bushes laughed the virtue of economy to scorn, with their perfumed affluence of pink and crimson and yellow. Pomegranates burst into scarlet flames; mimosas tossed aloft feathery balls of many hues. Jessamines and honeysuckles, holding up vases of gold, to catch every sunbeam, ran hither and thither at their own sweet will. So did tiny green lizards, with scarlet throats, and swift chameleons, with curious intelligent eyes. The air was tuneful with the flight and song of bees and humming-birds, cooing doves, and shining-winged spindles. Manifold, in truth, were the garden\u0027s delights: varied sound and color and perfume, cheerful radiance and gentle gloom, unobtrusive companionship and soft seclusion, were all to be found within its pleasant compass. \n \n And, as the days grew long and warm with the Spring\u0027s advance, Bergan now and then, growing weary of the confinement and monotony of his office, took his Blackstone, or Kent, or whatever might be the legal authority under examination, and gave himself the refreshment of an hour\u0027s reading, in one of the garden\u0027s shady, sequestered nooks. Doing this, one sultry afternoon in May, the drowsy influence of the atmosphere, and the soothing murmurousness of the insects\u0027 song, soon proved too potent for the logical connection of the learned legal thesis; there were unaccountable gaps between fact and deduction; and, going back to pick up the broken thread, Bergan lost it altogether. Sleep had stolen upon him through the dusky foliage, and she held him fast until the latest sunbeam, through a convenient aperture in the verdant walls, laid its light finger on his eyelids. \n \n Waking suddenly, but completely, hushed voices, proceeding from a neighboring thicket, met his ear. \n \n \"Impossible, Felix.\" \n \n \"But, Astra,—\" \n \n Had there been danger in those low, earnest accents, Bergan could scarcely have started up more quickly and cautiously, nor have fled from them faster. As he expected and desired, the low boughs closing and rustling behind him, made what followed inaudible. He was loath to hear another word. He felt almost guilty for having heard so much. Those subdued, confidential tones, those quietly spoken Christian names, had, of themselves, been a startling revelation. For, notwithstanding her frank, easy, affable deportment toward those who came within her sphere, Astra Lyte knew well how to hedge herself round with a maidenly dignity that kept familiarity at a distance. She was not the kind of girl whose Christian name finds its way easily to unaccustomed lips. Despite his own residence, for a considerable time, under the same roof, and the frank and friendly intercourse which had grown out of it,—despite, too, the fact that Mrs. Lyte often called him her son, and Cathie was wont to spring to his arms as to those of a brother,—it had never occurred to himself to call her anything less formal than \"Miss Lyte.\" Nor would it have done to Dr. Remy, he felt sure, without the sufficient warrant of a close and tender relation. This premise being established, the conclusion that such a relation existed was unavoidable. \n \n And, looking back over the events of the past few weeks, Bergan was amazed to see with what an amount of corroboratory evidence he was unexpectedly furnished. Not only did numberless glances, tones, and actions, bearing directly upon the case, start suddenly into view, but, just as the landscape through which one passes presents new outlines, new features, and a new sentiment, in a backward survey, so these things assumed new faces and a new meaning, in his review of them. Once or twice, of late, it had occurred to him that Astra was scarcely at her ease, in Dr. Remy\u0027s presence; he now understood that this constraint came of affection, fearful of betraying itself, and not, as he had imagined, of some newborn distrust or dislike. Anterior to this, he had observed that the doctor\u0027s visits to Miss Lyte\u0027s studio were much more frequent than formerly, and that he was making an obvious enough attempt to commend himself to her favor by a more cordial and constant interest in her work, as well as by exercising a more careful circumspection over his conversation. His cynicism vanished, or veiled itself, before the rich glow of her enthusiasm. His satire spared her generous ambition. His scepticism, though not less frank, was less hostile and inveterate; and often it resolved itself into a kind of weary and wistful sadness, as if it were less a choice than a misfortune, and would gladly exchange itself for something better, if it only knew how. At such times, Bergan himself was sensible of a singular charm in his conversation, a kind of autumn-night splendor; chill, lustrous moonlight, mystical shadow, and vague mournfulness, blending into one, irresistible fascination. No doubt, Astra had been made to feel it still more keenly; no doubt, too, she had been led to believe that whatever was amiss in the doctor\u0027s beliefs would yield readily to her influence,—that he would prove scarcely less plastic in her hands than the clay wherewith she was wont to deal so cunningly. \n \n Yet Bergan could not help wondering a little at the doctor\u0027s ready success. Astra\u0027s genius, he thought, should have saved her from any hasty bestowal of her affections. He did not know that, in this regard, a woman of genius differs little from the most commonplace of her sisters. She gives her affections as trustfully, and flings herself away as freely, as the silliest of them all. \n \n Having gotten to this point in his meditations, and also to the middle of the open field, back of the garden, Bergan could not help turning and looking toward the thicket, the neighborhood of which he had so hastily quitted. His face grew troubled and anxious, as he gazed. Was Doctor Remy anywise worthy of the heart that he had won? Bergan shook his head ruefully, as he asked himself this question. Without intent or wish of his own—in spite, even, of some strenuous efforts to the contrary—a deep distrust of the doctor had rooted itself in his mind. Though it gave but scanty justification of itself to his intellect, and was not allowed to show itself in his actions; though, now and then, he made a sturdy effort to uproot it, and cast it out, as an ungenerous return for kindness, or something that looked like it; it, nevertheless, kept its ground, and quietly strengthened itself there. It did not fail, now, to thrust itself into view, as a partial answer to his question. The bright spring landscape, with its crowded leaf and bloom, and its rich promise of fruit, seemed to darken with a shadow from Astra\u0027s future, as thus revealed to him. Must the promise of seed-time and harvest fail, then, only in the moral world? \n \n Though Bergan, driven by a nice sense of honor, had fled so precipitately from the voices and the neighborhood of the lovers, there is no reason why the reader may not return thither, and see what is to be learned from their conversation. \n \n \"I cannot think it right,\" said Astra, \"to leave mother in ignorance any longer.\" \n \n \"Do you think, then,\" asked Doctor Remy, reproachfully, \"that I would ask you to do anything wrong?\" \n \n Astra hesitated for a moment. Perhaps it then and there occurred to her, for the first time, that the doctor\u0027s standard of right was likely to differ from her own, in the same ratio as his religious faith. \n \n Doctor Remy did not wait for the tardy answer. Putting his arm round Astra, he drew her head on to his shoulder. The movement might have been prompted by tenderness; none the less, it had the effect to take his face out of her line of vision. \n \n \"All my life long, Astra,\" said he, in a deep, moved tone—(it is often easier to put a desired note into the voice, than a corresponding expression into the face)—\"all my life long, I have had a strange desire to be trusted,—trusted implicitly. Faith without sight—blind, unquestioning faith—is to me one of the most beautiful as well as desirable things on earth; all the more so, perhaps, that it is not given to me to feel it. But it has always been my dream, my hope, to inspire it. In my ideal picture of the woman whom I should love, it was always her consummate, irresistible charm. Must I now make up my mind to do without it?\" \n \n Astra was touched. \"If it did not seem to be wrong!\" she exclaimed. \n \n The doctor shook his head. \"That is not trust,\" said he, \"at least, not the trust that I mean. Who can so order circumstances that they shall never seem to condemn him? But the faith of which I speak, having once assured itself of the integrity of its beloved, never again admits it to be an open question.\" \n \n Astra was silent. The doctor heaved a heavy sigh. \"I see that I am not to realize my ideal,\" said he. \"Well, it cannot be helped. I will give you the explanation that you need. Perhaps, being satisfied, in this instance, that I have a good reason for what I do, you will be able to trust me hereafter.\" \n \n \"I will, indeed I will!\" exclaimed Astra, eagerly. \n \n \"The worst of it is,\" pursued the doctor, \"that you compel me to betray a trust—your mother\u0027s trust.\" \n \n Astra\u0027s cheek flushed. She had been miserable at the idea of keeping anything from her mother; was she, then, the one really excluded from confidence? \n \n \"Stay,\" said she, proudly, \"I do not wish to hear anything that my mother desires to conceal from me.\" \n \n \"Then,\" replied the doctor, \"it is impossible for me to explain why our engagement must not be made known, at present, to your mother.\" \n \n Astra looked bewildered, as well she might, at this apparently inscrutable complication. \n \n Doctor Remy seemed to take pity on her perplexity. \"Listen, dear,\" said he, \"and you will soon understand. Your mother consulted me professionally, a fortnight since.\" \n \n Astra\u0027s cheek grew white with sudden fear. \"What is it?\" she gasped. \n \n \"There is no immediate danger,\" said the doctor, \"and may not be, for years, with due precautions. But there is a tendency to heart disease; and it is imperative, just now, that she should not be agitated. And this, Astra, is the reason why she must not hear of our engagement, for some time to come.\" \n \n Astra looked down thoughtfully. \"I think you are mistaken,\" said she. \"I believe it would be a relief to her to know that my future is in such good hands.\" \n \n \"Doubtless, that would be the ultimate effect,\" replied Doctor Remy; \"but there would be emotional excitement, at first, more than is good for her;—so much that I, as a physician, am bound to forbid it.\" \n \n Astra could not but admit that the prohibition was just. Mrs. Lyte had seemed very fragile and feeble, of late. Astra had urged that application to Doctor Remy which, it now appeared, her mother had made, but in regard to the results of which she had chosen to keep silence,—from a loving wish, probably, to save her daughter from unavailing anxiety. Astra\u0027s heart swelled at the thought. \n \n \"Are you sure,\" she asked, \"that there is no immediate danger?\" \n \n \"As sure as one can be, in such cases—if she is kept quiet.\" \n \n \"And is there any probability that the disease may be eventually cured?\" \n \n \"There is a possibility,—with the same indispensable condition.\" \n \n Doctor Remy waited for a moment, in order that Astra might be duly impressed with this answer; then, he asked with a kind of proud humility;— \n \n \"Have I justified myself, in this matter?\" \n \n \"Forgive me,\" said Astra, penitently. \"Of course I never really distrusted your motives; I only fancied that my duty to my mother could not be affected by them.\" \n \n \"You see,\" suggested Doctor Remy, \"how easy it is to be misled by appearances, even with the best intentions. The faith, of which I used to dream, would never have fallen into that error.\" \n \n \"I will try to have it, hereafter,\" said Astra. \n \n \"And yet,\" returned Doctor Remy, \"you will doubtless insist upon a further explanation of the reason why I do not wish our engagement to be known to the outside world.\" \n \n \"Indeed, I shall not,\" returned Astra, glad of an opportunity of proving that she was neither so distrustful, nor so curious, as he believed. \"Of course, the outside world must wait till mother is informed; she has the right to the first telling. If you have any other reason for keeping the matter secret, I do not seek to know it.\" \n \n Could Astra have seen the look of triumph in Doctor Remy\u0027s face, she would have been startled. But he only said, quietly,— \n \n \"Thank you for so much trust.\" And, after a moment, he added,—\"As you say, it is your mother\u0027s right to know first. Of course, then, you will not indulge in any confidences to intimate friends.\" \n \n \"Certainly not,\" said Astra, a little surprised. \"Indeed, I have none,—except, perhaps, Carice Bergan.\" \n \n \"I would not mention it, even to her,\" said the doctor. \n \n \"I do not intend to,\" replied Astra, decidedly. \"But I must go in; mother will miss me.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59272.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
