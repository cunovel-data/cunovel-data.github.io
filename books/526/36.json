{"id":32166,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 12 TOO LATE.","content":"In those days, there was a pleasant spice of uncertainty about Southern journeyings. Cars, steamboats, and stages ran in happy independence of each other and the time-table. The traveller never knew at what point of juniper swamp, or pine barren, or cotton plantation, he would be set down to while away some hours in botanical or ethnological investigations, if his mind were sufficiently at ease, or in chewing the bitter cud of impatience, if it were not. Defective machinery and lazy officials labored mightily together to miss connections, and wherever human inefficiency came short, down swept a hurricane from the skies, and strewed the roads with prostrate trunks of trees, through which the cumbrous stage coach had literally to hew its path. More than one such delay attended Bergan\u0027s progress southward. Under their teasing friction, the shadowy anxiety with which he had set out, increased to a positive weight of alarm. Reaching Savalla on the twelfth evening, he stopped neither for rest nor refreshment, but looked up a horse, flung himself into the saddle, and set off toward Berganton at a rapid rate. Outside the city limits, however, he was forced to slacken his pace. The night was dark, no faintest gleam of moon or star tempered the black obscurity of the tree-arched and swamp-bordered road. Compelled thus to feel his way, as it were, it was near midnight when he came upon the outlying fields of Oakstead. Reluctantly he told himself that an interview with Carice, to-night, was out of the question; she and all the household were certain to be fast asleep, it was doubtful if even the faintest outline of the darkened dwelling would be discernible through the murky night. He had no choice but to ride on to Berganton. Scarcely had he reached this conclusion, when a radiant window shone vision-like through the trees; a little farther on, and the cottage, though yet distant, came full into view through an opening in the forest, brilliantly illuminated from roof to foundation as for a festivity of no ordinary magnitude. Even the surrounding lawn was lighted up into the semblance of day; and in its remotest corner, a group of negroes, dancing to some strain of music inaudible to the wondering spectator, looked fantastic enough for the unsubstantial images of a dream. For a moment or two, Bergan suspected his jaded senses of playing him false, as a step preparatory to taking leave of him altogether. There was something too incongruous to be real, between this gay scene of festivity and the picture presented by Doctor Remy\u0027s last letter,—a dull, silent house, its master a feeble, exacting convalescent, its mistress and daughter worn out with anxiety and watching. An intuition of some unlooked-for calamity seized him. Putting spurs to his horse, he dashed over the mile that intervened between him and the cottage, at a scarcely less furious rate than that with which Vic had borne him over the same road—how well he remembered it!—just one year ago. He did not suspect that he was now to taste the bitterest consequences of that ride. In a very few moments, he rode through the open gates of Oakstead. Here, he found the avenue to the house encumbered with teams and saddle-horses, tied to every tree and post. The every-day aspect of these sleepy animals was like a bucket of cold water to his excited imagination. Strains of dancing music, too, came to his ear,—flutes and violins, none too well played, sent forth the notes of a popular air. Plainly, he had been a fool to connect the thought of calamity with anything so exceedingly common-place as an evening party. If Godfrey Bergan chose to call in his friends and neighbors to dance over his restoration to health, who should gainsay him? Convalescents had their fancies, and must be humored. In this cooler frame of mind, it naturally occurred to Bergan that he was in no fit condition to face a festal throng. His appearance, thus way-worn and travel-stained, would be scarcely more timely than that of the Ancient Mariner to the wedding guest. It would look as if he, too, had a tale of horror to impart, and Carice might be unpleasantly startled,—Carice, who little imagined him so near to her! At the thought, a strange, indefinable thrill and shiver passed over him, hard to define as either pleasure or pain. After a moment\u0027s consideration, he dismounted, and walked quietly round to the spot where the negroes still kept up their lively dance. One of them, Bruno by name, stood a little apart, a smiling spectator of the merriment that he was too old to join. It was easy to touch him on the shoulder, without attracting the notice of the rest. The negro turned, and instantly recognized Bergan; but his exclamation of surprise was cut short by the young man\u0027s significant gesture, and he silently followed him to a spot equi-distant between the cottage and the dancers. \"All well, Bruno?\" was Bergan\u0027s first inquiry. \"All bery well, Massa Arling. You\u0027s welcome back, sah. But I\u0027se sorry you\u0027s too late for de weddin\u0027.\" The wedding,—the word fell almost meaninglessly on Bergan\u0027s ear, so intent was he upon satisfying himself that his late anxieties had been groundless. \"And Miss Carice,\" he went on, \"is she quite well, too?\" Bruno smiled. \"Yes, massa, I \u0027spec so, tho\u0027 she do look mighty pale and peaked, dese yere last weeks. But dey mostly look so, at sich times, I s\u0027pose. She\u0027ll be better when de weddin\u0027s ober, an\u0027 all de fuss and flurry.\" This second mention of \"the wedding\" penetrated to Bergan\u0027s understanding, and awakened a faint emotion of surprise. \"The wedding!—whose wedding?\" he asked. Bruno opened his eyes wide in astonishment. \"Why, don\u0027 you know, sah? I thought you\u0027d come on purpose. Miss Carice\u0027s weddin\u0027, to be sure.\" It was Bergan\u0027s turn to look more than astonished, confounded. \"Miss Carice\u0027s wedding!\" he repeated, as doubting the trustworthiness of his own ears. \"Yes, sah, to Doctor Remy, sah. Dey had—\" Bruno stopped short in alarm. Bergan\u0027s face had grown deadly pale, his blank stare was that of a man who neither saw nor heard. For a few merciful moments, he was simply stunned with the suddenness and severity of the shock. Too soon his benumbed senses began to revive, he put his hand to his head, where a dull, heavy pain was beginning to make itself felt; mechanically he sat down on the grass, and his breath came hard like that of a man stricken with apoplexy. With a delicacy not uncommon in his race, Bruno turned his eyes away. A trusted servant of the household, he had seen Bergan and Carice together enough to be able to divine something of the state of the case. Slowly, one by one, Bergan\u0027s thoughts came out of chaos, and ranged themselves into something like order. This, then, was the reason why Doctor Remy had so persistently discouraged his earlier return to Berganton, and allayed his anxiety with plausible statements respecting Carice and her father,—that he might supplant him in her affections. But why? It must be taken as evidence that he had estimated the doctor\u0027s character more correctly than he knew, that it never once occurred to him as possible that love for Carice had been the doctor\u0027s motive; yet, considered solely as holding the reversion of the Oakstead estate, her hand was scarcely worth the labor and treachery it had cost. There was so little to reward investigation in this direction, that Bergan\u0027s thoughts came back to his own blighted hopes, and here he was pierced with the sharpest pain that he had yet felt. The treachery of the doctor was as nothing to the faithlessness of Carice. Two months,—yea, two days ago, he would have staked all his hopes for time and eternity on her truth. Fair and delicate as was the cast of her beauty, and sweet and gentle as was her manner, there had always been a certain quiet steadfastness about her, which was one of her most potent charms. All hearts felt intuitively that they might safely trust in her. What subtle or powerful influence could have been brought to bear upon her, to make her so belie herself! He looked up. \"Bruno, how long has this been going on?\" The negro did not quite understand, but made shift to guess what was meant. \"De engagement, sah? since October, I b\u0027lieve.\" \"And how long has Doctor Remy visited here?\" \"Oh, a good while, \u0027bout eber since you went away. But after massa was took sick, he come oftener, ob course—ebery day, sometimes two, tree times a day. Massa got so—\u0027pendent on him, like, he couldn\u0027t bear to have him out ob de house, one time.\" Bergan fell into thought again. He began dimly to understand something of the sort of pressure to which Carice had been subjected, and the motives that had governed her,—not that he held her exonerated, by any means—only she was a little less culpable than she had seemed, at first. But if she had sinned, poor child! how miserably she would be punished! What a sterile soil, what a chill, unfriendly climate, awaited this delicate flower, in Doctor Remy\u0027s hands! It was as if a lily should think to root itself in a rock, or a rose expect to bud and blossom on an iceberg. Besides—why had he not thought of it before?—to-morrow, perhaps, in two or three days, at farthest, Doctor Trubie would be here, with authority, if it seemed good to him, to take this man, her husband, into custody as a murderer! Bergan\u0027s was the fine, strong temperament, which rises to the greatness of a crisis. With the necessity of action, the chaos of his mind began to clear itself. \"Bruno,\" he asked, suddenly, \"does—Miss Carice love this man?\" Bruno looked surprised, as well he might, at the question; but there was something in Bergan\u0027s tone that made him answer at once, and frankly; \"I don\u0027 know,—de servants do say she done it to please her father.\" Bergan laid his hand impressively on the old negro\u0027s shoulder. \"Bruno, I must see her at once. Her happiness—more than her happiness, the honor and peace of the whole family—is at stake. Find some way to let her know, quietly, that I am here, and that I must see her for one moment. Hurry! there\u0027s no time to waste.\" Bruno was so thoroughly mastered by Bergan\u0027s earnestness, that he started swiftly toward the cottage, without a word. As he ascended the piazza steps, however, he began to be appalled at the difficulty of the task that he had undertaken. Looking into the window, he saw Carice standing at the farther end of the long parlor, with her bridesmaids clustered around her. He could neither get at her, nor she escape, without challenging a good deal of wondering observation. While he stood hesitating, Godfrey Bergan came out into the hall, and caught sight of his troubled face. \"Well, Bruno, what do you want?\" \"I—jes\u0027 wanted to speak to Miss Carice,\" stammered the negro. The request was an odd one, at that moment; still, Mr. Bergan might have been moved to grant it, as the whim of an old and faithful servant, if the negro\u0027s disturbed face and faltering tone had not excited his suspicions that something unusual was on foot. \"What is the matter?\" he asked. \"What do you want to speak to her for?\" Bruno was wholly unprepared for this question. Vainly he racked his brains for a plausible answer, but nothing better rewarded his efforts than,—\"I jes\u0027 wanted to speak to her, dat\u0027s all;\"—a reply so little congruous with his frightened face and voice, that Mr. Bergan\u0027s suspicions were confirmed. He stepped out on the piazza, and closed the door behind him. \"How, Bruno,\" said he, sternly, \"I want to know what this means. Come, no shuffling; tell the truth.\" Bruno\u0027s self-possession gave way entirely. \"I—I—I—it\u0027s only Mr. Arling.\" Mr. Bergan started. \"My nephew, Bergan Arling, do you mean?\" \"Yes, massa.\" \"What—where?\" \"Out dar, under de larches, massa.\" \"And he—he dared to ask for my daughter?\" Mr. Bergan\u0027s voice shook with anger. Bruno tried to explain, not very coherently. \"He didn\u0027t mean no harm, massa, I\u0027se sartain. He said her happiness and all you\u0027se happiness, was at de stake.\" \"Did he!\" muttered Mr. Bergan, scornfully. \"Hark you, Bruno, not a word of this to anybody—to anybody, mind you! Now, go back to your dance,—I\u0027ll see Mr. Arling.\" Bergan\u0027s impatience had brought him from under the larches to a point commanding a view of the path to the cottage. He was both surprised and disappointed to see his uncle instead of Carice; nevertheless, he came frankly forward to meet him, holding out his hand. Mr. Bergan took no notice of the friendly offer. \"How dare you show yourself here?\" he began, his voice quivering with rage. \"How dare you insult my daughter with your presence, at this time? Have you not done harm enough already?\" \"Uncle,\" replied Bergan, gently, \"I know not what you mean. I have never harmed Carice, that I know of, and now I came here to save her, if it be not too late. Oh! uncle\"—and here his calmness began to fail him, and his voice grew eager—\"do not, do not let this marriage proceed,—at least, not until you have heard my story, and have satisfied yourself of the real character of this Doctor Remy!\" \"What have you to say against his character?\" demanded Mr. Bergan, icily. Bergan felt the full disadvantage of his position. It was a heavy charge that he had to make against a man of Doctor Remy\u0027s standing, without documents or witnesses, nothing to substantiate it but his single assertion. Besides, to say truth, there was nothing to allege against Doctor Remy but Doctor Trubie\u0027s suspicions. He hesitated, and his hesitation was not lost upon his uncle; neither was the want of assurance with which he finally spoke. \"Uncle, there is great reason to believe—or, at least to suspect—that Doctor Remy is a—murderer,—the murderer of my brother Alec.\" Godfrey Bergan stood in silent scorn. The accusation struck him as too extravagant, too baseless, to be seriously discussed. His nephew must be drunk, or mad, to make it. And, now that he looked at him more narrowly, his face was haggard and his dress disordered enough to befit either condition. Bergan saw the impression that he had made, and a cold, sick despair crept over him. \"I beg of you, uncle,\" he exclaimed, vehemently, \"as you value your own future peace of mind, put a stop to this unhappy business, ere it be too late.\" \"It is too late now,\" said Mr. Bergan, impatiently, \"Carice is already married.\" \"Must she, therefore, be left in the hands of a murderer? Save her, at least, from further contamination. If you will do nothing else, call her, and let her decide the matter for herself.\" \"Impossible,\" answered Mr. Bergan, decidedly. \"Carice has already borne and suffered too much; her nerves are in an exceedingly sensitive state; this story would kill her, I verily believe. If you really have her happiness at heart, go away quietly, and leave her to the care of the husband she has chosen.\" \"Chosen?\" repeated Bergan, bitterly,—\"has she chosen him, or has she only been forced to wed him?\" Godfrey Bergan\u0027s eyes lit. \"You forget to whom you are speaking,\" said he, coldly. \"Enough of this, my patience is exhausted. I have listened to your drivel longer than it deserves. The quicker you take your leave, the better.\" Bergan drew himself up haughtily, and his eyes flashed back an answering flame. \"My patience is also exhausted,\" said he. \"I have begged and pleaded long enough. I tell you now, uncle, that I will not go, until I have seen Carice, if I seek her out among the wedding guests.\" Godfrey Bergan set his teeth hard. \"Will not?\" he repeated angrily. \"Will not! I will have you to understand, young man, that there is neither will, nor will not, on these premises, but mine. On my soul, if you do not go, and quickly, I will call my servants, and have you put off from the place as a drunkard and a vagabond.\" At this threat, the hereditary temper, scotched in Bergan\u0027s heart, but not yet killed, reared its evil head aloft, and sent its deadly poison burning through all his veins. \"Call them,\" he retorted, in a voice deep and low as a distant thunder peal, and lifting his clenched hand on high,—\"call them, if it so pleases you! Their blood be on your head, not mine.\" Godfrey Bergan was no coward, yet he might well stand aghast at the unexpected fury of the tempest that he had evoked. Moreover, to put his threat in execution, he now saw, to court that publicity which he specially desired to avoid. He stood irresolute, questioning within himself how best to deal with the emergency. He was saved the trouble of a decision. While he still hesitated, Bergan\u0027s hand fell by his side, his eyes softened, and a spasm of anguish passed over his face. \"God forgive me!\" he murmured, shudderingly,—\"I, too, was a murderer—in heart!\" He bowed his head on his hands. Woful was the inner conflict. Within his soul, the \"black Bergan temper\" was gasping out its last venomous breath, with the clutch of a firm hand on its throat. Agonizing were its death-throes. They ceased at last. It would never trouble him more. Godfrey Bergan, standing by, saw something of the struggle, yet did not understand it in the least. \"A drunkard\u0027s aimless wrath!\" he said to himself,—\"quenched in its own fury.\" So carelessly does the world construe the deeper soul-conflicts that come under its observation! Bergan lifted his head, and his face was ashy pale. \"I go, uncle,\" said he, hoarsely, \"since that is your wish. In all that I have said, though said never so unwisely, I assure you that I have had only Carice\u0027s happiness at heart; and I pray God that you may not have cause to rue it, to your dying day, that you did not listen to me!\" He turned and plunged into the darkness, not knowing whither he went.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59283.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
