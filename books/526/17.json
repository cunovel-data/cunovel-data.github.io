{"id":32147,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 6 OF CLAY.","content":"Bergan\u0027s first glance around the studio was necessarily a comprehensive one, dealing with general effect, rather than minute detail. A large (though not a lofty) room; a bare floor; walls crowded with designs and studies; four or five busts and statues standing around the sides, and the life-size figure of a child in the middle, of the room;—this was what that first glance revealed to him. \n \n Cathie gave him no time for a second. \"Look at the dear little boy, Mr. Arling; do look at him!\" she exclaimed, joining her hands over her head, and executing a rapturous pas seul around the object of her delight. \"See his cunning little whip, and his funny little feet, and isn\u0027t he a little white darling!\" \n \n Thus besought, Bergan turned his attention to the statue in the midst. \n \n At first sight, it seemed to represent merely a pretty and playful human child, with a toy-whip in his hand, his head half-turned over one shoulder, and an arch and roguish expression, as if bent on some errand of mischief. But, while Bergan continued to gaze, fascinated, the small physiognomy seemed to grow wily and malign, as well as arch; and an intelligence, far more swift and subtle than ever infant of mortal race was gifted withal, informed the tiny features. The light feet, too, were plainly moved by deliberate purpose of guile, rather than childish impulse; and on their soles, broad sinuate leaves were bound, either for protection or disguise. \n \n Bergan looked at the figure long and earnestly, enjoying its delicate freshness and piquancy, but trying in vain to fathom its meaning. \n \n \"What will-o\u0027-the-wisp is it?\" he finally asked. \"And what is he doing, with his soft cunning and smiling malice?\" \n \n \"He is a god,\" replied Astra. \"As to his errand, it is the laudable one of cattle-stealing.\" \n \n \"It seems to be a case of very early depravity,\" said Bergan, smiling, yet puzzled. \n \n \"Early enough to be termed \u0027original sin,\u0027\" returned Astra. \"For \n \n \u0027The babe was born at the first peep of day * * \n And the same evening did he steal away \n Apollo\u0027s herds.\u0027— \n \n Did you ever read Homer\u0027s \u0027Hymn to Mercury?\u0027\" \n \n \"Never. Indeed, I am not quite sure that I ever heard of it,\" replied Bergan. \"Is it usually counted among his works?\" \n \n \"I think so; though it is fair to say that his authorship of it has been questioned. At any rate, Shelley has put it into very musical English verse; and there I found my subject. The circumstances of Mercury\u0027s birth being first narrated, the newborn immortal is described as \u0027a babe all other babes excelling,\u0027 and also a subtle schemer and thief. He first invents the lyre, and accompanies his own impromptu song of \u0027plastic verse,\u0027 with it; then he is \u0027seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat,\u0027 and betakes himself to the Pierian mountains, where Apollo\u0027s \u0027immortal oxen\u0027 are feeding. Separating fifty from the herd, \n \n \u0027He drove them wandering o\u0027er the sandy way, \n But, being ever mindful of his craft,—\u0027 \n \n that is to say, his inborn guile,— \n \n \u0027Backward and forward drove he them astray, \n So that the tracks, which seemed before, were aft: \n His sandals then he threw to the ocean-spray, \n And for each foot he wrought a kind of raft \n Of tamarisk and tamarisk-like twigs,\u0027\"— \n \n \"I see,\" said Bergan, smiling. \"The consummate little rogue!\" \n \n Astra went on:— \n \n \"\u0027And on his feet he bound these sandals light, \n The trail of whose wide leaves might not betray \n His track; and then, a self-sufficing wight, * * \n He from Pieria\u0027s mountain bent his flight,—\u0027 \n \n driving the stolen cattle before him, of course. And this is the moment at which I have sought to represent him.\" \n \n \"And very perfectly you have succeeded,\" said Bergan, admiringly. \"The arch cunning and malice of the face is simply wonderful. Indeed, it seems to me that the statue lacks but one thing.\" \n \n \"And what is that?\" said Astra, quickly; at the same time flashing a swift, searching glance at her work, as if she would fain have anticipated the criticism. \n \n \"It does not tell how the story ended.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" said Astra, looking both relieved and amused. \"I am glad that you did not keep me waiting so long as Michael Angelo did poor Domenico.\" \n \n \"How long was that, pray?\" \n \n \"You shall hear. Domenico Ghirlandaio, a celebrated Florentine painter, having completed a picture of St. Francis, upon which he had exhausted his utmost skill, and which seemed to him to be perfect, sent for a young artist of great promise, Buonarotti by name, (who had also been his pupil), and asked for his opinion of the work. The young man contemplated it for some moments, said gravely, \u0027It needs but one thing,\u0027 and departed. The master remained, to study the picture anew, to pore over it hour after hour, and day after day, and rack his brain with the question what it needed. Years after, when Buonarotti had become Michael Angelo, and filled the world with his fame, Domenico sent for him to come to his death-chamber. \u0027What did the picture need?\u0027 he asked, faintly. \u0027Only speech,\u0027 replied Michael Angelo. The old master smiled,—and died.\" \n \n \"It is a touching story,\" said Bergan. \"And it is almost an allegory, too. For \u0027only speech\u0027 is so often the great need of life! All our deepest feeling and best thought are inarticulate. But am I to be indulged with the rest of this story, also?\" he added, turning again to the statue. \n \n \"I will give it you in brief,\" replied Astra, \"by way of whetting your appetite for the richer savors of the poem itself. Having driven his stolen cattle to Alpheus, the infant god selected two fat heifers for sacrifice. And here, it seems to me, is one of the finest touches in the whole poem. After kindling his fire, slaying his heifers, and offering a portion to each of the twelve gods, \n \n ——\u0027his mind became aware \n Of all the joys that in religion are. \n For the sweet savor of the roasted meat \n Tempted him, though immortal. Nathless \n He checked his haughty will and did not eat, \n Though what it cost him words can scarce express.\u0027 \n \n Here, you see, is real self-denial and self-conquest,—for the sake of making an acceptable sacrifice,—and their deep after delight.\" \n \n \"If the offering had been less ill-gotten,\" remarked Bergan, somewhat dryly, \"I think the \u0027touch\u0027 would have been still finer.\" \n \n \"I confess that I had forgotten all about that,\" said Astra, laughing, \"in my admiration of the infant god\u0027s mastery over himself. Still, we cannot expect to find the purity of the Gospel standard of life in the heathen mythology; we can but be thankful for the gleams of Divine light here and there irradiating it, since a whole people long lived and died under its sanction. But, at this rate, my story will never end! The baby god next proceeded to remove every trace of his holocaust, working all night \u0027in the serene moonshine.\u0027 Then, at break of day, he betook himself to his natal cavern, crept quickly to his cradle, pulled his \u0027ambrosial swaddling clothes about him,\u0027 and put on a soft semblance of new-born innocence. In due time, Apollo, having discovered the loss of his cattle, and suspecting who was the rogue, came to the cavern, found the \u0027subtle, swindling baby,\u0027 lying \u0027swathed in his sly wiles,\u0027 and taxed him with the theft. At once, the young \u0027god of lies\u0027 shows forth his character. He stoutly denies all knowledge of the mischief; he pathetically declares,— \n \n \u0027I am but a little newborn thing, \n Who yet, at least, can think of nothing wrong; \n My business is to suck and sleep and fling \n The cradle-clothes about me all day long,— \n Or, half-asleep, hear my sweet mother sing,— \n And to be washed in water clean and warm, \n And hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm;—\u0027 \n \n and, finally, he swears that he does not even know \u0027whatever things cows are!\u0027 However, Apollo turns a deaf ear to all his wiles and pleadings, and compels him to go before Jupiter; who laughs to hear his plausible account of himself,—\u0027and every word a lie,\u0027—but finally bids him show Apollo where he has hidden the stolen cattle. This he does, \u0027nothing loath,\u0027 and finally subdues the sun-god \n \n ——\u0027by the might, \n Of winning music, to his mightier will: \n . . . . . sweet as love, \n The penetrating notes did live and move \n Within the heart of great Apollo: he \n Listened with all his soul, and laughed for pleasure.\u0027 \n \n \n \"And here we may as well leave them. For the rest of the story,—as well as for many pleasant pictures and nice touches, of which my abstract gives no hint,—you should go to the poem itself.\" \n \n \"I shall be sure to do so,\" said Bergan, \"with this arch, airy little figure to lead the way. But it should be in marble, it seems to me, rather than in plaster.\" \n \n Astra smiled gravely. \"For that, a patron—or, at least, a purchaser—is needed. Marble is expensive as well as indestructible; few artists can afford to put their works into its safe keeping, without help. And perhaps it is as well that such is the case, else Posterity would never be able to bear the stony accumulation that would be heaped on its back.\" \n \n \"I think I can venture to promise that it would never feel this airy creation to be a burden,\" said Bergan, earnestly. \n \n \"I hope not. But my little Mercury is still my youngest darling, and I feel all a mother\u0027s partiality for it; I have no eyes for its faults. When the inevitable time of disenchantment comes, and I am able to see it as it is, I can better tell whether I care to commit it to the white immortality of marble.\" \n \n She continued to gaze at the statue for some moments with fond, dreamy, wistful eyes,—-just as a mother might regard her newborn infant. Bergan felt a slight pang in beholding this nearness of the work to its author, this strong, tender, indissoluble bond between the two. Would ever any work of his—any brief, or plea—come from such a warm depth of his heart, and embody so much of his life? A poet, a musician even, might know something of this deep gladness of creation; but a lawyer, a judge, dealing with dry reason and dusty legal enactments,—was there any such joy in his work for him? \n \n Leaving the question unanswered,—as he must needs do, until time and experience should come, to his help,—Bergan turned anew to the contemplation of the Mercury; which seemed to grow in beauty and power, as he continued to look. It would be hard to say how much of this pleasurable effect was due to the inherent charm of the work, and how much to the spell shed from the rapt face and softly illuminated eyes of the artist. Many a work that we look upon but coldly, would quickly find its way to our hearts, if we knew enough of its history and its author, to give us the clue to its subtler spirit and aim; while those which we love without such knowledge, would, by its help, be transfigured—glorified. If we could stand with Michael Angelo before his \"Moses,\" or with Guido before his triumphant \"Archangel,\" what new lights of interpretation would be lit for us at the eyes and lips of those great masters! \n \n Nor must it be said that the spectator may be dazzled by the artist\u0027s enthusiasm into awarding the work higher praise than a cooler judgment would sanction. For just here lies the truth which is too often overlooked in criticism, both of literature and art. If the critic be not in sympathy with the worker,—if he do not, in some measure, behold the work through his eyes,—if he cannot discern what was attempted as well as what is attained,—then his eyes will be partially holden both from the beauties and the faults of the work. For nothing, in life or art, was meant to be looked at by itself. Everything is related to something else; each helps all. The moment wherein the spectator\u0027s mood and the artist\u0027s work make sweet harmony, is the moment of correct appreciation. \n \n If Bergan did not understand what an illumination the presence of Miss Lyte threw over her work, he was fully conscious that her work shed a transfiguring light over her. The face under the whispering oak boughs was not the same as this in the studio. That had been simply bright and mobile, with a spice of espiéglerie; this was all alight and astir with genius. Miss Lyte\u0027s very hand partook of the transformation. Bergan had happened to notice its symmetrical shape, as revealed by a careless gesture, at their first meeting; but he now decided that it was not so much its beauty which had attracted his attention, as a certain peculiarity of delicate energy and adroitness, which ought of itself to have suggested its artistic skill. \n \n Bergan\u0027s eye fell next on the pedestal of the Mercury, improvised by turning up on end the packing-box in which it had arrived. The lid lay on the floor, in two pieces, and was surmounted by a sturdy-looking hammer and chisel. Bergan\u0027s glance went back to that slender hand, with an unconscious question in it; which Astra was quick to understand. \n \n \"Why not?\" said she, with a smile. \"Of course, I might have called in old Cato to open the box; but he would have done it so slowly and awkwardly that I should have suffered tortures in watching him; it was easier to do it myself. To be sure,\" she went on, taking up the hammer and chisel, \"these are not quite so fit for a lady\u0027s hands as the lighter and slenderer implements that I use in modelling; but I like them well, nevertheless. It would go hard with me, here in this quiet country town, away from all aids and appliances of art, if I were not on very good terms with purely mechanical labor. I made the mould, from which that cast was taken, myself;\"—she pointed to the Mercury. \n \n Bergan looked as if he scarcely understood. \n \n \"I suppose you are aware,\" pursued Astra, \"that the word \u0027sculptor\u0027 is a misnomer, nowadays. The real sculpture—that is the marble-cutting—except a few finishing touches, is done by artisans skilled in that work. The plaster casts are made by regular casters, from moulds taken from clay models. These last, only, are the work of the artist throughout,—shaped by his fingers, and informed by his thought. See! here is the raw material of my work!\" \n \n She pointed to a large triangular box, in one corner of her closet, filled with fine, moist clay. She even leaned over it, and inhaled its earthy odor, with a kind of affection. \n \n Bergan also looked into it so long, so silently, and with so meditative an aspect, that Miss Lyte finally interrupted the flow of his thoughts with a question as to their character. \n \n \"I was thinking,\" replied he, \"of the many differing shapes,—lovely, grand, sorrowful, joyous, winning, repulsive,—that might be lurking within your tub. And I was wondering which of them you would next call forth.\" \n \n \"Think, rather,\" said Astra, smiling, \"of all the shapes that I have sent into it.\" \n \n \"You do not mean to say that you use the same clay over again,\" exclaimed Bergan, in surprise. \n \n \"Certainly, I do. It loses none of its adaptability by use. In that tub is the original clay of everything that you see in my studio,—all the busts, statues, and reliefs, that I have ever done, or tried to do,—all my successes, and all my failures;—every one of them has gone into that tub, even as it came out of it.\" \n \n \"Creation and death!\" exclaimed Bergan. \"\u0027Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\u0027 It is a world in miniature!\" \n \n \"And does it not also show that there is nothing new under the sun?\" said Astra. \"It is always the old material in new shapes, the old thought in new phraseology, the old human nature in new conditions, even the old particles of disintegrated human bodies in new organisms.\" \n \n \"And yet,\" remarked Bergan, musingly, \"the spirit, the idea, that informed those bodies, and gave them identity, is not lost, as your Mercury shows plainly. The being that you have created lives, and glows with all his proper warmth and fire, even though his original substance has not only returned whence it came, but has helped to frame an entirely different being.\" \n \n \"The natural body and the spiritual body,\" returned Astra. \"Not that the two processes are really analogous,—I do not mean that,—but one naturally suggests the other to the mind. And, seeing how I am thus able to accomplish a kind of resurrection, in a way that I understand, I do not find it difficult to believe that the Almighty can do it, in a way that I do not understand, and far more perfectly,—retaining not only the indwelling spirit, but enough of the individual clay to justify Job\u0027s saying, \u0027In my flesh I shall see God.\u0027\" \n \n The thought kept them both silent, for a moment; then Bergan turned to see what else of interest was to be found in the studio. \n \n The completed works were not many; Miss Lyte was still too young to have made a large accumulation of such things. There was a bust, with a very sweet and noble expression, wherein she had embodied her recollections of a fellow student in art. There was a half-sleepy, half-ashamed boy-face, looking out from under the shadow of a drooping hat, representing \"Little Boy Blue,\" of nursery fame. There was a winged cherub, with an exceedingly lovely, innocent face,—a very incarnation of celestial joy and peace. In relief, there was a stout urchin, ankle-deep in water, laden with pond-lilies, and looking for more. Finally, there were innumerable studies, sketches, and designs, with all the warmth and freshness of the original inspiration lingering about them; which interested Bergan scarcely less than the finished work, as admitting him still more freely into the arcana of the artist\u0027s mind and method. \n \n He was especially interested to observe in how many directions the genius of Miss Lyte had tried its wing. There were studies, and even finished pictures, in oil and in crayon; there was an exquisitely-cut cameo, fastened on a background of velvet; there were designs for stained-glass windows; and in all, there was a curious medley of subjects,—scriptural, mythological, historical, domestic, and still-life. It was plain that she had been slowly feeling her way to some point, where she could take her final stand, and see her life-work lying clear and fair before her. Had she found it? Looking at the Mercury, Bergan could almost believe that she had; but, glancing again at her deep, wistful eyes, he doubted it. A little more time, a profounder and wider experience, would settle her genius, fix her aims, and make her capable of things far higher than aught that she had yet achieved. \n \n Meanwhile, never, he thought, was anything quite so inspiriting as her conversation. As she went with him from statue to statue, and sketch to sketch, talking frankly of her difficulties and struggles, her failures and successes, her aims and aspirations,—now dropping a fertile suggestion, now pointing out a subtile analogy, now giving the key-note to some elevating strain of thought,—she seemed to radiate energy, and exhale inspiration. Listening to her, Bergan\u0027s depression and discouragement vanished like mists before the sunshine. When he went back to his studio, it was with new strength and courage and ambition. Somehow, life had ceased to look unsympathizing, and success remote. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59264.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
