{"id":32175,"no":45,"title":"Chapter 7 ORDERED STEPS.","content":"Bergan was much struck with the fact that his aimless walk—aimless, at least, so far as his own intention was concerned—had first led him, in virtue of his meeting with Cathie, to Mrs. Lyte\u0027s bedside, and next to the studio of Miss Thane. Accepting both these leadings as parts of the same providential plan, though he could discern but the slightest possible relation between them, he knocked at the studio door. \n \n \"Come in!\" was the immediate response, in Miss Thane\u0027s clear, cold monotone. \n \n Bergan pushed open the door, which was a little ajar, and found himself in the presence of the artist. She was standing at her easel, palette and brushes in hand; and she waited to give several touches to her work, before turning toward her visitor. \n \n If she felt any surprise at sight of him, her face betrayed none. Yet it seemed to Bergan that some change had come over that face since he beheld it last—a certain suggestion of weariness under its languor, of dissatisfaction under its chill pride—which he accepted as a good augury for the task that he had in hand. \n \n Miss Thane seemed to divine, at once, that his visit had some object other than the pleasure of seeing either herself or her pictures. After a few quiet words of greeting, she rested one hand upon her easel, and stood waiting, calm, proud, and exceeding beautiful, to be informed of its nature. \n \n Bergan was scarcely prepared to make known his errand so abruptly. He had promptly entered the studio, in obedience to his first impulse; but he had counted upon some little time thereafter to arrange his thoughts and feel his way, some flow of conversation to be duly turned to his advantage, or some clue to the deep mystery of Miss Thane\u0027s sympathies,—possibly, too, some further light upon the inscrutable design of Providence, in sending him hither. \n \n After all, was not the most straightforward course likely to be the best one? \n \n \"Miss Thane,\" said he, gravely, \"my own volition has had so little to do with bringing me here, that I scarcely know why I am come. But I believe that it is to try to interest you in a sister artist—a sculptor—who is in sore need of aid that you might give her.\" \n \n Miss Thane put her hand into her pocket, and drew out her purse; but before she could open it, Bergan stopped her with a deprecating gesture. \n \n \"Pardon me,\" said he, \"but that sort of aid, I can give myself, if it be necessary.\" \n \n \"What am I to do, then?\" asked Miss Thane, wonderingly. \n \n \"Whatever one delicate, refined, large-hearted woman can do for another, in the way of cheer, encouragement, sympathy, and consolation.\" \n \n Miss Thane gave him a long look out of her deep eyes, partly surprised, partly meditative. \n \n \"What put it into your head to come to me on such an errand?\" she finally asked, with a singular, half satirical emphasis. \n \n \"Because when I was wondering to whom I could go,\" answered Bergan, \"I found myself standing before your door. Because you did me the honor, two weeks ago, to ask me a certain question, and I thought that this might be the beginning of a better answer than I was able to give you.\" \n \n Miss Thane slowly walked to the other end of the room, and fixed her eyes on the deep red gold of the western horizon, whence the sun still shed a soft posthumous influence over the earth. \n \n \"What does it matter,\" she murmured to Herself, \"if I do surrender somewhat of my freedom? I have had a fair trial of an isolated life—divested of every irksome bond, burden, and duty, shut up to the one friend that I trust, and the one occupation that I love—and what has it done for me? Absolutely nothing; except to make me daily colder in heart, and narrower in mind. Is it not time to try something else?\" \n \n She turned back to Bergan, and her face, though it was still weary, was no longer proud. \n \n \"I am sensible of the honor that you have done me,\" said she, with unusual gentleness; \"I will try to deserve your good opinion. Where am I to find the lady of whom you speak, and in what way can I render her the most essential service?\" \n \n Bergan quietly placed a chair for her. \n \n \"Sit down,\" said he, \"and let me tell you the whole story; at least, as far as I know it myself.\" \n \n As he talked, the gold faded out of the sky, and the gray twilight shadows crept into the room, turning the pictures on the walls into pale, vague outlines, and giving a wonderful softness to Miss Thane\u0027s listening face. Nor did the story end until the pictures had become indistinguishable masses of shadow, and nothing was left of the face but its deep, lustrous eyes. Its owner had not once spoken; and it quite escaped Bergan\u0027s notice, in the dimness, that she gave a sudden, violent start when Mrs. Lyte\u0027s full name was mentioned. \n \n \"Thus, you see,\" he concluded, \"it is not only a disappointed, discouraged, anxious heart (soon, alas! to become a mourning one) that I commend to your tender sympathies, but a sorely wounded faith. If you cannot heal the latter, do not, I charge you, help to destroy it.\" \n \n \"I will not,\" answered she, solemnly; \"I promise you that I will not. How could I, when I am half inclined to believe that such faith—unfounded, illusory though it be—is a better thing than any reality that we exchange it for.\" \n \n Bergan slightly lifted his eyebrows. \"May I ask,\" said he, quietly, \"to what reality, or realities, you refer?\" \n \n \"You press me hard,\" answered she, bitterly, after a pause; \"none, none that I can think of just now. Everything seems vague, unreal, unsubstantial.\" \n \n \"Fall back on faith,\" returned Bergan, smiling. \"If it be not a reality itself, it works realities. It fosters real virtues, and inspires real heroism; by it men live nobly, and die courageously. What reality can do more for them,—indeed, what one does so much?\" \n \n He waited for a moment, expecting an answer. Seeing that none came, he bowed, and left her sitting there, gazing out into the silent night. \n \n \n On the following morning, Astra was in her studio, busily plying her needle, while her mother slept, when there came a light knock on the door. Opening it, she found herself face to face with a lady of such rare and remarkable beauty, that she stood motionless, lost in wonder and admiration. \n \n The stranger bent her head with the stately, yet friendly, grace of one princess to another; and a smile just touched her lips, and then seemed to sink into her eyes, shining farther and farther down in their clear depths, until it vanished from sight. \n \n \"Will you allow me the pleasure of looking into your studio?\" asked she, in a voice as perfect as her face; \"I have heard so much of its marvels, that I am desirous of seeing them for myself.\" \n \n Astra mutely made way; her visitor glided into the room, cast a quick, comprehensive glance around, and sat down in front of the statue of Mercury. \n \n \"Do not let me interrupt you,\" she said to Astra, \"but just go on with whatever you are about, and allow me to study this at my leisure.\" \n \n Astra hesitated a moment, and then took up the work that she had dropped,—one of Cathie\u0027s much-enduring aprons, that she was trying to darn into some semblance of respectability. But she could not help stealing an occasional glance at the clear-cut profile of her guest, until, all her artistic instincts being thoroughly aroused, she was fain to seize upon crayon and cardboard, and make sure of the lovely outline, ere it should vanish, as she expected it would soon do, utterly and forever from her sight. \n \n The guest, meanwhile, studied the Mercury in profound silence. Yet Astra soon felt that an uncommonly deep and delicate discernment was brought to bear on her work, capable of accurately measuring both its excellences and its faults. There was something inspiriting in the very thought,—it was so seldom that her sculpture was favored with a really intelligent glance! Her eyes brightened, her hands recovered their cunning, the crayon sketch grew into lifelikeness without effort, almost without consciousness, save when she stopped to marvel, now and then, at its exceeding beauty and delicacy. Yet it did no more than justice to the original,—scarcely that, indeed;—where did she get that face, and who could she be! \n \n She had left the Mercury now, after a few—a very few words of commendation, yet spoken so cordially and discriminately as to be worth volumes of ordinary praise to Astra; and she was looking gravely into the upturned eyes of the Cherub. Glancing from, it to its creator, she said, with a faint smile;— \n \n \"I wish you could put that look into my face.\" \n \n Astra shook her head. \"I could not put it anywhere now,\" she answered, drearily. \n \n The stranger gave her a compassionate glance. \"I wonder,\" said she, musingly, \"whether it is better to have had such faith and lost it, or never to have had it at all.\" \n \n \"It is better to have lost it,\" replied Astra quickly, and with a slight shudder. \"One can live in the hope of finding it again.\" \n \n The visitor sighed, and turned to look at the sketches on the wall. \n \n By and by, she slid easily into a discourse about various art-matters; holding Astra spellbound, for awhile, with the fluent richness of her diction, and the extent of her knowledge. Nor was Astra allowed to listen only. A certain graphic portrayal of art-life in Italy having stirred her to the depths, and kindled the old fire and energy of enthusiasm in her eyes, she was skilfully drawn on to talk of herself and her work, her aims, longings, limitations, and needs, as she had never talked before, because she had never before met with so understanding and sympathetic an auditor. \n \n In the midst of one of her animated sentences, a low moan was heard from the inner room. \"Excuse me,\" said Astra hurriedly, amazed to see how completely she had forgotten her cares, fears, and griefs, in the magic of the stranger\u0027s presence,—\"Excuse me, I must go to my mother.\" \n \n Mrs. Lyte had waked, as was too often the case, in a spasm of pain. Astra hastened to call Cathie from the kitchen to assist the laboring breath with gentle wafts of air from a fan, while she herself measured some drops of a soothing mixture, and lifted her mother\u0027s head on her arm, to enable her to swallow and to breathe more easily. Several anxious moments had passed thus, in silence broken only by the painful respirations of the invalid, when a low, sweet strain of melody stole so gently into the room that Astra could not tell, at first, from whence it came. So soft was it that it melted into the ear without making any apparent demand upon the attention, yet so clear that not one liquid note was lost. The swollen veins of Mrs. Lyte\u0027s forehead subsided; her chest ceased its agonized heaving; a peaceful, happy smile broke over her face. \n \n \"What is it?\" she asked, wonderingly, when the strain ended,—not abruptly, but gradually growing fainter, until it was impossible to tell just at what point sound became silence. \n \n Astra whispered softly that she had left a strange visitor in the studio, who appeared to be singing unconsciously to herself. \n \n \"If she would only sing again!\" murmured Mrs. Lyte, wistfully. \n \n With her usual impulsiveness, Cathie rushed to the studio door. \"Mamma wishes you would sing—\" she began, and then stopped short, no less surprised and fascinated by the face that met her gaze than her sister had been. \n \n The stranger reflected for a moment, then her voice again pervaded the air, as with the very soul of restful melody. As she sang, the child moved slowly toward her, drawn as irresistibly as the magnet to the loadstone, till she stood close to her side, encircled by her arm, and gazing at her with round, wondering eyes. As the song ceased, she slid her hand half-curiously, half-timidly over her shoulder. \n \n \"Have you wings?\" she asked, earnestly. \"Did you fly down?\" \n \n Before the visitor could reply, except by a swift expression of something like pain that flitted across her face, Astra appeared in the doorway. \n \n \"Mother wishes to see you, and thank you,\" she said. \"Will you step this way?\" \n \n The lady rose, and moved quietly into the inner room. At sight of her face, Mrs. Lyte gave a violent start; the thanks she was about to speak died on her lips; she could only cry out in amazement;—\"Who are you?\" \n \n The stranger knelt by the bedside, and took both Mrs. Lyte\u0027s hands in her soft, cool grasp. \"I am the daughter of your runaway sister, Aunt Katie,\" she answered, \"and my name is Godiva Thane.\" \n \n \"But she died, and she left no child,\" said Mrs. Lyte, incredulously. \n \n \"She died in giving me birth,\" returned Diva, with convincing positiveness. \"I have long suspected that my father did not let you know, he never forgot the opposition to his marriage; besides, he was jealous of his only child\u0027s affections. You must needs forgive him,—for he is dead.\" \n \n Several questions followed, on Mrs. Lyte\u0027s part; to which Diva gave long, detailed answers, skilfully contrived to satisfy her aunt\u0027s curiosity, tranquillize her emotions, and bring her, in a brief space, to a tolerably peaceful and composed state of mind. \n \n \"Can I do anything for you before I go?\" she then asked. \n \n \"Nothing, dear, unless you will sing to me—a hymn; there are tones in your voice which are more soothing than any anodyne.\" \n \n Diva put her hand to her brow, and sent her thoughts back—a long, long way, it seemed to her—to a period in her childhood, when she had been under the care of a certain faithful nurse, afterwards discharged by her father for putting foolish, superstitious notions—as he averred—into her head. There she found two or three hymns; keeping tenacious hold of her memory, in virtue of their early grafting therein; which she sang in such soft, even tones, that Mrs. Lyte was first calmed, and then irresistibly lulled to sleep. \n \n The two cousins stole out of the room together. In the studio, Diva put her arms around Astra and kissed her tenderly. \n \n \"Having found you, my little cousin, my art sister,\" said she, smiling, \"I shall never let you go!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59292.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
