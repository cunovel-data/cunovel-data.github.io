{"id":32136,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 4 A GOODLY HERITAGE.","content":"Early as was the hour, Bergan found the table already laid for breakfast in the room below, where he was soon joined by the Major. He brought with him (besides a noticeable odor of brandy), a cordial morning greeting, and a temper which, though by no means urbane, had a certain, flavor of bluff good nature, in pleasing contrast with his extreme irritability of the preceding evening. Encouraged by these and similar signs of a clearer mental atmosphere, Bergan ventured to mention his uncle Godfrey, and to remark that he had been charged with a letter to him from his mother, which he must take an early opportunity to deliver. \n \n \"Eh! what?\" asked the Major, laying down his knife and fork, with the look and tone of a man who doubts the evidence of his own senses. \n \n Bergan quietly repeated his words. \n \n The Major\u0027s face grew dark, and his eyebrows met in a heavy frown. \"I shall take it mighty hard of you, if you do,\" said he, sternly and gloomily. \"I tell you, Harry, he is no Bergan at all, and he ought not to be treated like one. Eleanor would never have written to him, nor desired you to visit him, if she had known the true state of affairs;—you can safely take that for granted, and act accordingly. Besides,\" he went on, after a slight pause, \"it is only fair to warn you that any one who goes from Bergan Hall over to Oakstead (that\u0027s what he calls his place), doesn\u0027t come back again,—with my consent. There\u0027s no relation, nor commerce, nor sympathy, nor liking, between the two places; and there never can be any while I live,—nor after I am dead, either, if I can help it. So just put that matter out of your head, Harry, and say no more about it.\" \n \n Bergan looked down, and the color rose to his brow. Without seeking to know the merits of the quarrel between his two uncles, he nevertheless felt that the abject submission, the complete surrender of principle and will, expected of him by Major Bergan, was simply impossible; and he began to wonder if it were not his wisest course to place himself at once on tenable ground, by saying that, while he should always be glad of his uncle\u0027s advice, and ready to give all due and respectful consideration to his wishes, yet, in matters involving questions of right and duty, the final appeal must needs be to his own conscience. Something of this sort was upon his lips, when the Major spoke again, and in a more amiable tone. \n \n \"I am really sorry, for your sake, Harry, that things are just as they are,\" said he. \"Of course, it is not agreeable to you to run thus unexpectedly against a family feud;—I really ought to have written Eleanor about it, but I thought to spare her the knowledge of her half-brother\u0027s disgrace. Besides, as Godfrey is our nearest neighbor, it might be pleasant to be on visiting terms, if he and his were only the right sort of company to keep.\" \n \n \"I think he has children near my own age,\" remarked Bergan. \n \n \"Not now. His two eldest died a few years ago.\" \n \n \"Ah, yes; I remember hearing of it when I was in college.\" \n \n \"He has but one left—a daughter,\" pursued the Major. \"A pretty, bright little thing she was, too, as a child; I was really quite fond of her, and she used to spend half her time here,—that is, in the old Hall;—and Maumer Rue almost idolized her, because she fancied that she was something like what Eleanor was at her age. She even used to run away and come over here, after the trouble began; but I reckon they must have found it out, and put a stop to it.\" And the Major ground his teeth at the recollection, as if he owed his brother an especial grudge on this very head. \"However,\" he went on, \"it is better so; for though I could never have found it in my heart to be unkind to the child,—so fond of me as she was, too!—yet I want nothing to do with anybody, or anything, that belongs to Godfrey; and so I am glad, on the whole, that she stopped coming. Doubtless, she will soon merge the name of Bergan into Smith, or Brown, or something equally desirable; and as Godfrey has no son, to bear his patronymic and carry on his business, we may hope that there will be an end of them.\" \n \n The last words were spoken with ineffable contempt. Then, suddenly rising, as if to dismiss the subject, the Major remarked, with an entire change of tone and manner:— \n \n \"But I must not sit here chatting any longer, for I suspect that Ben—that\u0027s my head driver—is waiting for instructions. Will you come with me, or do you prefer to amuse yourself about home?\" \n \n \"I will go with you, uncle, if you are willing.\" \n \n \"Both willing and glad. Come on.\" \n \n Bergan followed his uncle out into the quadrangle,—here called the \"street,\"—and found it to be, for the most part, silent and deserted. The cabins, many of which, on the evening previous, had been brightened by a little gleam of firelight within, or vivified by moving figures, were now closed and locked, the occupants being away at work in the fields. They were all neatly whitewashed; and they stood well apart from each other, leaving room for little gardens between, where vegetables, and, occasionally, flowers, were growing. Here and there, too, a pig rooted and grunted in a rude sty; or hens and chickens fluttered and cackled, in their busy, enlivening fashion, around the door. \n \n One of the buildings, of considerable size, and two stories high, where several women and children, with peculiar haggard, heavy, listless, and withal resigned faces, were lying or sitting around the porch, Bergan easily recognized as the infirmary. Another, seemingly stuffed with babies and young children, under the charge of several half-grown girls and one superannuated old woman, he knew to be the day-nursery; for the safe bestowal of the infant population of the quarter, during their mothers\u0027 absence in the fields. Here, Maumer Rue seemed to be making a visit of inspection; though invisible herself, the slow tones of her voice, exhorting one of the young nurses to greater watchfulness, sounded distinctly from within; and becoming quickly aware of the approach of her master and his guest, she came to the door, and made them a stately courtesy, as they passed. \n \n Quite apart from the quarter, yet within sight, stood a cabin of especially rude and forlorn aspect; the open door of which disclosed a strong stake driven into the ground in its centre, and divers rusty chains, handcuffs, padlocks, et cetera, hanging round its sides. This was the prison. Human justice being thus provided with a fitting abode, Bergan involuntarily looked around in search of a corresponding dwelling for Heaven\u0027s mercy, in the shape of a little cross-tipped church or chapel,—but saw none. \n \n Major Bergan first stopped at the threshing-mill, where Engine (that is to say \"Engineer\") Jack, a remarkably intelligent negro,—and an exceedingly black one as well,—was waiting to bring to his master\u0027s notice certain slight repairs necessary to the machinery. While the needful discussion was going on, Bergan looked around him, the better to understand the topography of the place. \n \n He observed that Bergan Hall, the roof of which he saw afar off, rising among the trees, was situated upon a considerable elevation,—a sort of bluff, overlooking a small inlet, or arm of the sea. To this circumstance, Major Bergan owed his ability to live upon his plantation throughout the year, instead of fleeing therefrom, like most of his class, at the approach of summer. For, just when the home-scenery takes on its most tender and fascinating grace,—when the rice-fields are green as the meadows of paradise,—when the temple-like oak-glades are most beautiful with gentle gloom and glinting sunshine,—when every thicket has its garland of bloom, and every tree has its clinging, flowering vine,—when the sweet-smelling pine-woods are glittering with the gorgeous coloring, and melodious with the multifarious voice, of thousands of birds and insects;—Just then, the rice-planter has to flee for his life from its final, treacherous charm—-the soft-shining mist, the deadly malaria, that creeps up at night from the marshes, and covers the land like a sea. If he lingers for but one ramble in the fair, moon-lighted, and moss-festooned avenues, through that silver haze, fever walks by his side under the grand arches, and death waits for him at the end of the alluring vistas. \n \n From this terror and this necessity, the owner of Bergan Hall was free. His vast plantation stretched across the border-line which divides the pestilential rice-swamps from the healthful sea-islands; one extremity touching the river, and the other the ocean. At one time, its chief revenue was derived from the far-famed sea-island cotton, to the production of which its sea-board portion was well-adapted, but as that crop declined, and the rice-crop rose, in value, its neglected swamp-lands were gradually reclaimed and brought under cultivation; and were now the most valuable portion of the estate. Too remote from Bergan Hall to poison it, or its vicinity, with their malaria, they were yet quite near enough for necessary superintendence. \n \n The negro quarter lay somewhat lower than the Hall. On its left, the ground sloped gradually down to a little creek; where lay several flat-boats loaded with rice, to show what had been the goal of the negro procession of the previous evening. Along the opposite bank ran a dark fringe of pines. \n \n Horses were now brought. The one assigned to Bergan was a superb blooded filly, full of life and fire. While he stood taking delighted note of her many fine points, she sniffed round him in half-wild, half-curious fashion,—now starting quickly back, now timidly drawing near,—and ended by frankly putting her nose in his hand, as if in token of amity. Nor had he been long on her back, ere he felt, with an electric thrill of pleasure, that perfect sympathy between horse and rider, that singular blending of their identity, which is the purest delight of horsemanship, and best explains the fable of the Centaur. \n \n \"How do you like her?\" asked his uncle, at this juncture. \n \n \"Exceedingly,\" replied Bergan, with enthusiastic emphasis. \"I think that I never rode anything more admirable.\" \n \n \"Henceforth, then, she belongs to you. And never mind the thanks,—I am really glad to hand her over to a fitting master. She is too much given to dancing and frolicking for my use,—-my sober-paced stallion meets my wants a great deal better;—consequently, Vic—that\u0027s her name, short for Victoria,—Vic stands in the stable, eating her head and kicking her heels off, for the greater part of the time. She will be much happier in the hands of a master young enough to sympathize with her.\" \n \n Bergan could not fail to be delighted with a gift so generous and so timely; bestowed, too, with a delicacy of manner, an appearance of asking a favor instead of conferring one, in strong contrast with his uncle\u0027s wonted bluntness. Visions of long, solitary rides of exploration rose fascinatingly before him. Nor would he suffer his pleasure to be alloyed by any insidious doubt lest the gift might some day take the form of an unpleasant obligation. \n \n The road ran along the bank of the creek, passing divers fields under cultivation, and divers others long \"turned out,\"—that is, exhausted, and left to lapse back into their primitive pine-barrenness. In the course of an hour, the two gentlemen came upon a second negro quarter, considerably larger than the first, but with the same general characteristics, even to the threshing-mill. This one, however, ran by water power, instead of steam. \n \n The horses were here left in charge of a negro, while the gentlemen walked over to the rice fields. They soon came into view, stretching, almost as far as the eye could reach, along the bank of a broad, turbid river. Bergan speedily became much interested in their complicated system of dykes, ditches, canals, and gates; as well as in watching the dusky laborers, both men and women, that were busy therein. Leaving details for results, however, he could not but be impressed with the fact that a vast amount of hard work was annually done, and a rich and remunerative crop annually reaped. Plainly, Major Bergan was an energetic, skilful manager. \n \n On his part, the Major was greatly pleased with his nephew\u0027s intelligent interest, and predicted, more than once, that he would make a rice-planter of him, in due time, who would show his neighbors \"what was what.\" \n \n The sun was half way down the western slope, when the uncle and nephew returned to the cottage. Dinner over, the Major civilly expressed his regret that he was unexpectedly called to another part of the plantation. Bergan could accompany him; or—not to disappoint him of his promised visit to the old Hall—he could get the keys of Maumer Rue, and explore it by himself. \n \n Bergan eagerly caught at the latter alternative. Nor, to do him justice, was the Major at all displeased thereby. Without troubling himself to analyze his own emotions, he yet felt an unconquerable aversion to the task of showing his nephew through the deserted home of his forefathers. Though little accustomed to care for the opinions or the feelings of others, he foresaw an inevitable mortification in looking with Bergan upon the ruin and desolation for which he knew himself to be so largely responsible; since, if he had not invited the ravages of time, he had put forth no hand to stay them. Perhaps this feeling was strong enough, even, to lend to the business that called him away, an imperative aspect which it might otherwise have lacked. \n \n Bergan, on his part, was well content to dispense with his uncle\u0027s guidance. Not only would his presence be a constraint upon his own irrepressible emotions of sadness, regret, and, possibly, indignation; but there would be a rare, subtile charm in wandering alone through precincts at once so familiar and so strange, in finding out for himself (or led only by the shadowy image of his maiden mother), spots hallowed by the tender touch of oldtime joys and sorrows, and nooks and corners darkened not more by mould and cobwebs than by the clinging dust of immemorial family tradition. \n \n First, however, Major Bergan requested his companionship as far as the stable. There they found a bright looking boy, somewhat older than Jip, who had just finished rubbing down the filly of which Bergan had so lately become the master, and now stood regarding the result with great apparent satisfaction. \n \n \"Well, Brick,\" said the Major, sternly, \"I hope you\u0027ve done better than you did last time.\" \n \n \"Yes, massa, she done berry fine, I\u0027se sure,—spec\u0027 I put a right smart hour on her. Look a dar, now, don\u0027 she shine?\" \n \n The Major examined her carefully, and finding nothing to fault, silent. It was not his way to waste words in commendation. He merely turned from the horse to the negro, and asked, pointing to Bergan,— \n \n \"You see that young gentleman?\" \n \n \"Yis, massa; sartin, massa.\" And Brick made an embarrassed bow, uncertain whither this conversation might tend. \n \n \"Well, that\u0027s Vic\u0027s master, and yours. It\u0027s your business to take care of her, and wait on him,—that is, do everything he tells you. Hereafter, you are to go to him for orders.\" \n \n And quickly mounting his own horse, the Major rode off, without waiting for thanks or comments. \n \n Bergan stood looking doubtfully at his new acquisition. Property of this kind gave him a novel sensation; he could not tell, on the instant, whether he liked it or no. Nevertheless, he recognized the inexpediency of discussing the matter with the dusky chattel himself; who, to represent him fairly, seemed in nowise displeased with his change of owners. He had opened his eyes a trifle wider at his sudden transfer, and uttered a mechanical, \"Yis, massa,\"—that was all. He now stood, tattered hat in hand, waiting for orders. Bergan was somewhat disconcerted to find that he had none to give. Finally, he asked,— \n \n \"What is your name?\" \n \n \"Rubric, sah. But dey mos\u0027ly calls me Brick.\" \n \n \"Ah, yes, I see. And your family name?\" \n \n \"Hain\u0027t got no family, sah.\" \n \n \"Your father\u0027s name, I mean.\" \n \n \"Nebber had any fader, sah. He sold down souf, fore I\u0027s born.\" \n \n \"Your second name, then.\" \n \n \"Same\u0027s yours, massa, I s\u0027pose.\" \n \n \"Hum—How old are you?\" \n \n Brick scratched his head reflectively. \"Don\u0027 jes\u0027 know, massa, \u0027zactly. Spec\u0027 bout—bout—fifteen or—twenty, sah; jess \u0027s massa likes.\" \n \n Bergan bit his lip. Never had he met with such a spirit of accommodation. \n \n \"Well, Brick,\" he asked, after a moment, \"if you had a half-holiday, now, what would you do with it?\" \n \n Brick\u0027s face grew radiant through all its dusk. \"Go a-fishin\u0027, massa,\" he burst out, eagerly; \"I jes\u0027 should!\" \n \n \"Well, go fishing, then,—if you think you can be back by supper-time.\" \n \n \"Yis, massa. Tank you, massa.\" And Brick was off like an arrow from the string. \n \n Bergan immediately sought out old Rue\u0027s cabin. Outwardly, it differed little from its neighbors; but its interior was not without evidences of thoughtful provision for the faithful old nurse\u0027s comfort. Having kindly answered all the questions that she chose to ask, in reference to \"Miss Eleanor\" and her western life, he made known his errand. She instantly took a key from her pocket, and was about to put it in his hand, when she suddenly drew back, exclaiming:— \n \n \"No, no, that will never do! I forgot. That is the key of the back door. You see, sir, I sometimes look into the Hall, and that way is most convenient.\" \n \n \"I assure you that it will serve me very well, too,\" replied Bergan. \"It does not matter how I make my entrance.\" \n \n Rue shook her head. \"It is not fitting,\" said she, \"that the son and heir of the house should first enter at the back, like a servant.\" \n \n \"The son, but not the heir,\" replied Bergan, smiling. \n \n Rue turned quickly toward him. \"Not the heir!\" she exclaimed, as if greatly surprised. \"And why not?\" \n \n The question was not easy to answer. Bergan could not say frankly, \"Because such heirship must be bought at too high a price,—even the surrender of my profession, will, conscience, individuality.\" Nor did the answer present itself to his own mind in this definite form. He was conscious, at the moment, of nothing but a confused, hazy throng of doubts, fears, possibilities, and wishes. \n \n Rue seemed quite satisfied with his silence. She turned to a bureau near by, and, after a little search, drew forth a large, rusty key, which she handed him with a kind of solemnity. \n \n \"It has waited long,\" said she, \"for the hand that should rightfully put it into the lock, and let light and hope once more into the old house. I thank the Lord that I live to see the day.\" \n \n Bergan was too much touched to answer. He walked quickly to the front of the deserted mansion, cut the vines from the door, and put the key in the lock. At first, it opposed a stubborn resistance to his efforts; then, suddenly, the bolt yielded, the door turned slowly on its long-unused hinges, and he stood, with a beating heart, in his ancestral hall. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59253.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
