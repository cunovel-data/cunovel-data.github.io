{"id":32159,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 5 PARTINGS.","content":"Bergan and Doctor Remy walked home from the church, as they had gone thither, side by side; yet, for a considerable time, neither spoke. If not altogether congenial spirits, they were on sufficiently easy and familiar terms, in virtue of their almost daily association, to allow each to pursue his own train of thought, on occasion, without reference to the other. To Bergan, Mr. Islay\u0027s sermon had been interesting and effective, not only for what it contained, but for what it suggested. Naturally, therefore, his mind was now busy in following out those suggestions to the point where they bore upon his own experience, and unfolded their lessons for his own soul. But Dr. Remy\u0027s thoughts had long since strayed away from any channel into which the sermon was calculated to lead them. There had been some brief moments, during its delivery, to be sure, when he had shrunken inwardly, iron-nerved though he were, from the deep, sharp probing of certain of its sentences; and there had been a single instant, perhaps, wherein he had been made dimly to see, or to suspect, that his own life and character—much as he had prided himself upon being the independent artificer of them both—were really the results to which he had been holden by the cords of former, half-forgotten sins. But he had made haste to shake himself free from both the idea and its effect, with one smile of scorn at his own folly, and another at what he chose to consider the weak superstition of the clergyman and his awed, interested flock. He thanked God—using the phrase in a vague, general sense which, perhaps, was only equivalent to thanking himself—that he was not as these men were. And no sooner was he in the open air than he set his busy mind to the consideration of his own projects. Some clue to its workings may perhaps be afforded by the question with which he finally broke the silence. \"Have you ever had the yellow fever, Arling?\" \"No; it does not visit our western villages.\" \"Then, I advise you to take refuge in one of them, for the next three months. It is certain to visit Berganton ere long.\" \"Indeed!\" said Bergan, with more curiosity than alarm. \"Why do you think so?\" \"From the weather, the atmosphere, the present type of disease,—a dozen indications patent to the eye of experience. Besides, I am informed by a private letter that it has already appeared in New Orleans. Its arrival here is but a question of time. And I assure you that its acquaintance is to be avoided.\" \"Doubtless. And I shall do my best to avoid it—except by running away.\" \"You might as well say,\" answered Doctor Remy, dryly, \"that you will take every precaution against drowning—except to keep your head above water. Don\u0027t be fool-hardy, Arling. Yellow Jack has a keen appetite for strangers,—that is to say, for all who are not native born. If he spares any, it is usually the sickly and feeble, not the strong and vigorous. He would consider you a toothsome morsel. Take my advice, and go home, or go North, or take a sea-voyage,—do anything rather than remain here during the last of summer and the beginning of autumn. It will be no loss to you. After the first of next month, there will be absolutely nothing for a lawyer to do here but try to keep cool.\" \"And you?\" asked Bergan. \"Oh, I stay, of course. An epidemic is a physician\u0027s harvest time. Besides, I have had the yellow fever.\" \"Then the native-born do not all escape?\" \"By no means. Besides, I lost my birthright by many years\u0027 absence in Europe. It was immediately after my return that I was taken. Now I may consider myself acclimated.\" \"As I must be,\" replied Bergan, \"if, as is likely, I am to spend the remainder of my life at the South. Thank you for your friendly warning, but I think I must stay.\" Doctor Remy shrugged his shoulders, and said no more. He had merely tried the first and simplest expedient which occurred to him, for removing Bergan from the neighborhood. He was not surprised nor troubled that it had failed. He had expected as much. But there were other and surer means to his end, he believed, at his command. However, he was not obliged to resort to them. Early next morning Bergan came into his office, with an open letter in his hand, and a most anxious face. \"Read that,\" said he, huskily, \"and tell me if there is any hope.\" Doctor Remy obeyed, reading the letter not once only, but twice, and looking long and meditatively at the signature. Then he lifted his eyes to Bergan\u0027s face. \"Plenty of hope, in my opinion,\" said he; \"I do not attach as much importance as this Doctor Trubie does to your mother\u0027s fancy that she is going to die. It only argues a depressed state of mind, corresponding to a low state of body. Nevertheless, it is well to do whatever can be done to raise her spirits; and I suspect that your presence at her bedside will avail much to that end. Of course, you set out at once?\" \"Certainly. Can you tell me at what hour the next train leaves Savalla?\" Doctor Remy glanced at his watch. \"In an hour and a half. That gives you ample time;—fifteen minutes to throw a few things into a portmanteau, and tell me what I can do for you while you are away; five minutes for adieux, and an hour and ten minutes to reach Savalla, in the saddle, with a swift horse.\" \"If I can find one at such short notice,\" said Bergan, doubtfully. Doctor Remy pulled a bell-wire, and Scipio\u0027s black head appeared as instantaneously as if he had been attached to the other end of it. \"Saddle the roan, and take him round to the front gate,\" said Doctor Remy. \"Mr. Arling will ride him to Savalla, You will go after him, by the stage, this afternoon. Quick now!\" The head ducked, and disappeared. \"How can I thank you!\" exclaimed Bergan, wringing the doctor\u0027s hand. \"By attending to the portmanteau business at once. I will come with you; we can talk while you work. I want to ask something about this Doctor Trubie. Does he keep up with the times,—in medicine, that is?\" \"I don\u0027t know—I believe so.\" \"H\u0027m; there have been some recent discoveries of great value in the treatment of typhoids, when they run long and low, as they are apt to do. Suppose I write down a few suggestions, which, if there is grave need, you can commend to Doctor Trubie\u0027s favorable consideration. Otherwise, don\u0027t interfere.\" Bergan tried once more to express his gratitude, as the folded paper was put in his hand; but Doctor Remy cut him short. \"If you really want to thank me,\" said he, \"do it by staying away until the sickly season is over; I shall have yellow fever patients enough without you. Indeed, you must; having left, it would be suicidal to come back before the first of November. Tell your mother that I said so, when she is convalescent.\" \"When she is convalescent,\" repeated Bergan, quickly. \"Then you do hope!\" \"Of course I do. There is every reason for it. Your mother, being a Bergan, has a sound constitution, and an almost indomitable vitality; and she is not yet old. If Trubie makes a good fight, he is sure to win. At any rate, never despair till the breath is out of the body; nor even then, till you are certain that it cannot be brought back.\" Bergan could not but feel a pang of self-reproach for his long-smothered dislike and distrust of the man who was thus loading him with obligations,—help on his way to his mother, ready encouragement, and valuable professional advice. It did not occur to him that there is such a thing as doing good that evil may come! Doctor Remy looked after him with a triumphant smile. \"One out of my way already!\" he exclaimed. \"It would seem that the Devil (another name for Fate or Chance) has helped me!\" Bergan next sought Mrs. Lyte and Astra, for a parting word. He found the latter in her studio, sitting idly by a window, with her hands folded listlessly in her lap, and a weary, dejected face that went to his heart. Never before had he seen her otherwise than busy, bright, and earnest; never had she met his look with so faint and transient a smile. \"I am sorry that you are going,\" said she, sombrely; \"sorrier, perhaps, than the occasion may seem to warrant. But I cannot rid myself of a suspicion that this phase of our life and friendship is finished; and who can tell what the next may be! Do you remember our first meeting under the oaks, and the red sunset light, and the dark sunset cloud? You interpreted them to mean that we were to know sunshine and shade together, did you not? Well, we have had the sunshine; now, it is time for the shade.\" \"You forget,\" said Bergan, kindly, \"that the cloud was but for a moment, and the sunshine returned.\" \"No, I remember it well. But the cloud was very dark while it lasted, and the shine was not quite so bright afterward. It was nearer to its setting.\" Bergan could scarcely believe that it was Astra who spoke. Hitherto, she had been the moral sunshine of the house, felt even where it did not directly fall. Her spirit, in its potency of cheer, resembled the sunbeam which, though it kindle but one little spot on the floor into actual brightness, diffuses its light and cheerfulness throughout a whole room. As every article of furniture, every picture, every face, in the room, is the brighter for the sunbeam, so every inmate of Mrs. Lyte\u0027s rambling old dwelling had been the happier for Astra\u0027s presence and influence. The sound of her clear, buoyant voice, the thought of her light, busy figure, just across the hall, had always served to quicken and brighten his own energies. It had been very much his wont to bring all his shadows, discouragements, and despondencies, to be dissipated by contact with her breezy activity and cheery hopefulness. What had come over her, that she met him now with such dreary premonition of ill, such persistent dwelling upon the dark side? He looked down upon her with the question in his eyes, if not on his lips. She understood and answered it. \"It is only a dark mood,\" said she, passing her hand over her brow, \"not an actual trouble,—at least, not yet. But forgive me for afflicting you with it now, when you are under the shadow of a real cloud. Let us hope that it will pass quickly. When you reach home, may the sunshine be already there!\" \"Thank you. I shall expect to hear from you through Doctor Remy—all of you, I mean. He has promised to let me know how everything goes on here.\" Astra lifted her eyes searchingly to his face. Her fine perceptions had not failed to take note of his inadvertent linking together of Doctor Remy and herself, and his quick attempt to conceal it. She divined that he knew her secret. Her eyes fell, and her face flushed. Bergan took her hand, and lifted it, in gentle, chivalrous fashion, to his lips. \"I wish you every happiness,\" said he, in a tone that said more than the words,—\"every sunshine, and few clouds. Good-bye.\" \"Good-bye,\" she answered, withdrawing her hand, yet not without a certain lingering pressure, that seemed even sadder than her face, and that Bergan felt long afterwards. And he left her sitting where he found her. Mrs. Lyte and Cathie followed him to the door, the one with much quiet sympathy and regret, the other with passionate tears and lamentations. \"He will not come back! He will not come back!\" she screamed, wringing her hands, as he rode away; and the mournful cry followed him down the street, like a prophecy of woe. A little farther on, he discovered that Nix was trotting quietly alongside of his horse. And so intimately had the dog been connected with all his sojourn under Mrs. Lyte\u0027s roof, that, in sending him back, he seemed to close the final page of this whole epoch of his life. His road skirted a retired portion of the grounds of Oakstead. Suddenly, he espied Carice, standing on the bank of the creek, with her eyes thoughtfully fixed upon its rippling flow. His sad heart yearned towards her with irresistible force. Glancing at his watch, he saw that there was yet time for a brief, parting word. He flung himself from his horse, threw the bridle over a gatepost, and ran quickly towards her. \"I am so glad to find you here!\" he exclaimed, as he drew near. \"Otherwise, I must have gone without saying good-bye. I am sent for, in great haste; my mother is very ill, and—\" He stopped; his grave face said the rest. \"I am very, very sorry!\" putting her hand in his, with quick, earnest sympathy. \"When did you hear?\" \"This morning. She insisted that I should be sent for, as soon as she was taken ill; she believed that she could not recover. It is the typhoid fever.\" Carice\u0027s face blanched suddenly. \"Ah! that has a fearful sound,\" she said, shiveringly. \"My two brothers\"— Her voice failed, and her slight frame shook with sudden emotion. It was the first time that Bergan had heard her allude to the only sorrow which she had yet known; but the effect of which had been all the more keenly felt, doubtless, because, for her parents\u0027 sake, she had shut it resolutely into the depths of her heart, never allowing its shadow to be seen for a moment on the face wherein they now looked for consolation and cheer. Much moved, Bergan put his arm round the slender, tremulous form. At first, it was only the blind, manly instinct of help and support that prompted him; but with the act there came a swift revelation, a great rush of tenderness, that almost took his breath away. Though he had never suspected it till now, he knew, in an instant, beyond the possibility of a doubt, not only that he loved Carice, but that he had loved her long. Carice, on her part, was quick to feel the sudden, subtile change in the character of the support given her, and made a fluttering movement of escape. But Bergan would not let her go. \"Carice,\" said he, gravely, \"if I should return sorrowing, will you console me?\" \"If I can,\" she answered, simply, raising her blue eyes to his face. \"If you can!\" he repeated, with a deep tender intonation,—\"oh, Carice! it must be a heavy sorrow indeed that you cannot console!\" As he spoke, the day, which had hitherto been cloudy, suddenly broke into a smile, pouring a flood of golden light on the river, trickling through the boughs of the overhanging trees in great, shining drops, and flinging a yellow gleam far down their gray trunks. Wondrous sympathy of Nature with the bliss of two spirits made one,—the tender joy that keeps, throughout the musty years, the freshness and fragrance of its Eden birth! Yet, had the day still held its gloom, it would have been bright in Carice\u0027s eyes, and bright in Bergan\u0027s! Wherever Love is newly born, it creates a sunshine of the heart, which overflows upon the outward world, and fills it with celestial radiance. Five minutes later, and Carice was alone by the river\u0027s bank, blushing to hear how persistently the little stream kept whispering and singing of what it had just seen and heard. The leaves, too, seemed to be softly talking it over among themselves; and a red bird and a gray one were gossiping merrily about it among the branches. Still more plainly, Carice\u0027s face told the story, when she sought her parents. They saw at once that it was not the same face which had gone out from them an hour before. It had changed as an opening rosebud must have changed in the same time, under the balmy breathing of the warm south wind. Its merely girlish loveliness was over; playing about the mouth, and shining from the eyes, there was a bright and tender smile that seemed gushing from the very heart of awakening womanhood. Never had she seemed so lovely, never so radiant. Looking upon her, it was easy to divine the secret of angelic beauty. The heavenly existences are immortally beautiful because immortally happy. \"Did you engage yourself to him?\" asked Mr. Bergan, almost sternly, when her brief tale was told. \"Of course not,\" answered Carice, opening wide her blue eyes at the unusual tone,—\"not until you and mamma are consulted. Only, we know that we love each other.\" At the same time, Dr. Remy stood smiling to himself, in his office,—a dark, ominous smile. \"I am sure of three months,\" said he. \"And, in three months, tact and perseverance can accomplish a great deal.\" At the same time, too, Astra rose suddenly from the chair, where Bergan had left her sitting, and began to pace up and down the room. \"I have been idle too long,\" she said to herself; \"I have let myself dream till my world is peopled with shadows, and I cannot distinguish the false from the true. Work is what I want. Work will exorcise these phantoms, and make my brain clear and strong again.\" She stopped and looked fixedly into vacancy, striving to recall a former conception that had been dazzled out of sight in the golden dawn of her love. In a moment, it rose again before her; a great, stalwart, straining figure,—a man struggling up out of the waves that had wellnigh worsted him, with a little child on his shoulders. Quickly she improvised a kind of platform, and brought out her fertile box of clay. Nervously, she fastened her supports together; rapidly around them rose the soft, gray, plastic material in the rude, rough resemblance of a human form.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59276.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
