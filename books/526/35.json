{"id":32165,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 11 A CLUE.","content":"A chill November day was drawing near its close. With the evening dusk snowflakes filled the air, and began to whiten the swells and slopes of the Arling farm, and lay the foundation of future drifts beside the doorstep and under the eaves of the Arling homestead. This structure had begun life as a log cabin, but had grown, by the simple and natural process of adding on a room or a wing, as fast as it was required and could be afforded, into a large, and somewhat picturesque, cluster of roofs and gables; beneath which there might easily be not only room for the fullest, heartiest flow of domestic and social life, but also means and influences to a considerable degree of refinement and culture. \\n\\n \\n\\n Toward it, a stout, broad-shouldered personage was making his way, through the dusk and the snow, with a cheery face and an energetic tread, that plainly minded neither. Tramp, tramp, went the brisk footfalls up the gravel walk, the bright brass knocker was made to send a note of warning through the house, and the wayfarer admitted himself into a lighted hall, through which he strode to the open door of the sitting-room at the farther end. \\n\\n \\n\\n A pleasant family picture was before him. Bergan Arling, on one side of the crimson-covered centre-table, looked up, smiling, from the book out of which he had been reading aloud. Two of his sisters sat near him, busy with crotchet needles and bright worsteds. Still another was drawing at a side-table; and over her, giving her the benefit of his criticism, leaned her brother Hubert, scarce two years younger than Bergan, and so strikingly like him, that one was often taken for the other, outside the family circle. At one side of the fire-place sat the master of the house, a tall, noble-looking man, with eye undimmed and hair unfrosted by the snows of over sixty years. Opposite him was the home\u0027s true light and centre, the house-mother. She reclined in a large, low easy chair, the paleness on her face half concealed by the glow of the blazing fire, and her eyes shining with that tender joy and peace which convalescents sometimes bring back from the edge of the grave,—a reflection, perhaps, from the paradise that was already opening before the gaze of the half-freed spirit. \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Trubie paused for a moment in the doorway, to master the details of the scene. He has changed but little since he was introduced to the reader, fourteen years ago, in his medical Alma Mater. His figure has gained in breadth and strength, and his features in character, but it is the same frank, genial face, and the same good-humored smile. No one that knew him then, could fail to recognize him now. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a moment, he caught sight of Mrs. Arling, and hastened toward her with outstretched hand. \"I don\u0027t know whether to congratulate or to scold you,\" he began, smiling, yet shaking his head with mild disapproval. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hubert Arling came forward to Bergan\u0027s side. \"I can settle the question for you,\" said he. \"Congratulate her, and scold us. We brought her down, chair and all; she did not touch foot to the floor in the transit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I will save my scolding until it is needed. It seems little less than miraculous to see you here,\" he went on, turning to Mrs. Arling, \"when I think how things seemed to be going, a few weeks ago. It has been a hard pull, and a long one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And a strong one, and a pull altogether,\" added Hubert Arling, merrily, by way of arresting the tears that he saw starting into his sisters\u0027 eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The strong pull,\" remarked Doctor Trubie, \"came from my medical brother, down South.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You underrate yourself,\" replied Mr. Arling. \"Of what avail would Doctor Remy\u0027s suggestions have been, without your indefatigable vigilance, and your professional skill and knowledge to carry them out?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is to say,\" returned Doctor Trubie, \"that a good commander-in-chief can do nothing without good generals. At all events, Doctor Remy is a wonderfully talented fellow. He seems to keep not only abreast of medical science, but in advance of it. That very suggestion of his, which proved most valuable to us, was mentioned in my last medical review, as the latest discovery at Paris. There is something about his bold, yet scientific mode of reasoning which reminds me strangely of an old fellow-student. But Doctor Remy, I hope, is a better fellow than he was. By the way,\" he added, turning to Bergan, \"I came near forgetting that I have brought you a letter from him, as I judge from the handwriting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan tore open the letter, and with an apologetic bow to the company, began eagerly to read it. Doctor Trubie seated himself by the table, picked up the rejected envelope, and gave it a critical examination. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I call a good hand,\" said he, \"a round, clear, energetic hand, that neither tries your eyesight, nor rouses your distrust. There is no crookedness nor meanness in it; yet there is plenty of character; one can see, at a glance, that the writer is bold and sagacious as well as profound, a man of action as well as a man of science.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan had finished the letter, which was short; and he now looked up with a much amused face. \"I ought to tell you,\" said he, \"that Doctor Remy possesses the rare accomplishment of being able to write with either hand; he uses the right or the left, at pleasure. But the two handwritings are entirely distinct. That address was written with his left hand, and so, I remember, were the suggestions and prescriptions that I handed over to you. But this letter was written with his right hand; see what you can make of it,\" and Bergan pushed the open sheet across the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n The change in Doctor Trubie\u0027s face was startling. \"This!\" he exclaimed, his voice trembling with excitement, \"who did you say wrote this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Doctor Remy, the same man who wrote that address.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Trubie glanced back at the letter, and his eyes lit with a strange, stern joy. \"At last!\" he muttered through his set teeth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Arling leaned forward, and her face grew pale. \"What is it, doctor?\" she asked, trembling. \"What is the matter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Trubie glanced at her excited face, and saw what mischief he was doing. \"Nothing,\" he hastened to answer, \"nothing, only an old sore pressed on suddenly. This handwriting reminds me of one that—I never expected to see again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave the letter a long, moody look, then refolded it, and handed it back to Bergan. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Arling looked anxiously at her son. \"Does Doctor Remy give you any special news?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much. Uncle Godfrey is better, and the fever is over. Business is still dull.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you will not need to hurry back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan knelt by his mother\u0027s side. \"My dear mother,\" he whispered, \"you know it is not for the sake of my business that I am anxious to return, as soon as I may. I must see Carice, and satisfy myself that nothing is amiss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Arling smiled, yet she sighed, too. \"Ah, yes, I remember,\" said she, \"and you are quite right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Trubie rose, and came to the other side of Mrs. Arling\u0027s chair. \"I am glad to see that I am not wanted here any longer,\" he began, pleasantly;— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you are wanted,\" interrupted Mrs. Arling; \"you are always wanted, as a friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you; but I am wanted elsewhere as a physician; so I must take my leave, for the present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He shook hands with Mrs. Arling, and gave Bergan a meaning glance, as he did so. The young man rose. \"I will walk a little way with you, if you like,\" said he. \"I have a boyish delight in the first snow, and I did not see any last winter, you remember.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two gentlemen were hardly outside the gate, before Doctor Trubie asked;—\"What do you know of this Doctor Remy\u0027s antecedents?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan narrated the facts which he had gathered, from time to time, from Doctor Remy\u0027s conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So, he would have us believe,\" said Doctor Trubie, contemptuously, \"that he transformed himself from a poor lawyer into a scientific physician, in a year and a half, by the help of a friendly doctor, and a course of lectures! There is falsehood on the face of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He had a genius for the study,\" replied Bergan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, I\u0027ll warrant! that is the saving grain of truth in the whole story. Do you remember the circumstances of your elder brother\u0027s death?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not very distinctly. I was so young, at the time; and then, you know, mother could never bear to hear any allusion to them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know that he was murdered?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan looked surprised. \"I know there was talk of suicide,\" said he, \"but I thought it was decided that he was poisoned by mistake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was murdered,\" asserted Doctor Trubie, getting his teeth, \"foully murdered by the man who professed to be his friend,—a man who wrote a hand as much like this Doctor Remy\u0027s as one side of your face is like the other. I charged him with it, at the time, and I have always believed that I should live to see the charge proven.\" And he finished by giving a succinct account of the circumstances attending Alec Arling\u0027s death. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan listened attentively and critically, as became his legal training. \"I do not understand why the finding of the diamond was such conclusive evidence of guilt,\" said he, when the doctor paused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Roath swore, at the inquest, that he did not touch either bottle or glass, and did not even go to that end of the table. That was where he overreached himself; without that, the stone in the glass would not have been such a damning circumstance. He recognized it as such himself;—else why did he fly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you may be right about the murder,\" said Bergan, after a little consideration, \"but I think you have mistaken the man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let us see,\" said Doctor Trubie. \"He is about my height?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,—perhaps a little taller.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He stoops a little?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not at all, he is uncommonly erect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has dark hair?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may have been so, it is prematurely gray.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Trubie looked a little discomfited. \"Give me a sketch of his character,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan hesitated. It was a difficult thing to do, on the instant. His impressions of Doctor Remy\u0027s character had varied, as he remembered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On second thought,\" said Doctor Trubie, \"I will give you one. All of him, that is not intellect, is ice. In religious matters, he is an utter sceptic. Socially, he is brilliant; but he has no intimate friends, and he makes no confidants. Men and women, to him, are subjects of study, not objects of affection. He cares for nothing but himself and his profession. And no one cares for him—much. They may admire, but they cannot love.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan looked considerably startled. \"Your sketch tallies well with some impressions of mine, which I did my best to rid myself of,\" said he. \"But Doctor Remy has befriended me, from the first, and you yourself say that he has been largely the means of saving my mother\u0027s life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has had his own reasons for both; Edmund Roath never did anything without a reason, and a selfish one. Has he anything to gain by keeping you out of the way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing, that I can imagine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When do you return to Berganton?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother has consented that I shall start on Monday, if she is no worse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She will be much better. Do not delay longer than that. I will accompany you; I want to see this Doctor Remy. Seeing is believing. But, mind, not a word of my coming, to him or any one else. Now, go back to your mother, or she will be alarmed. Good night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bergan walked back slowly and thoughtfully. Without being fully convinced of the truth of Doctor Trubie\u0027s suspicions, he was strangely disturbed and startled. Reaching the gate, he turned his face south-eastward, and gazed across the white meadows, toward the dim outline of the distant hills. His thoughts overleaped even that far barrier, and took an air line to Oakstead and to Carice. Her face rose vividly before him, not, strange to say, as he had seen it last, rosy and bright, but pale and piteous, and gazing toward him with a look that besought sympathy and succor, plainer than any speech. His eyes grew moist, his breath tremulous; his heart swelled with passionate love and longing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will beg my mother to consent to my going at once,\" said he to himself. \"I cannot wait another day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next afternoon, he was on his way to Berganton, whither Doctor Trubie was shortly to follow him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59282.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
