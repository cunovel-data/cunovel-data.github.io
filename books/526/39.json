{"id":32169,"no":39,"title":"PART FOURTH. A NEW FIELD. 1 ALIVE IN FAMINE.","content":"Rarely does a man go down to the verge of the grave, and look into its profound and pregnant depths, without carrying from henceforth traces of the journey. His views of life will be truer, if not sadder, forever afterward. The laws of moral perspective, though they do not change, will be better understood; so that objects at a distance are no longer dwarfed to the understanding, however they may appear to the eye. Character becomes the central \"point of sight,\" toward which duty continually draws converging right lines, by the aid of which happiness, fame, and wealth, fall into their proper places, and assume their true proportions. \n \n Bergan Arling was seated in his office at Savalla. At first sight, it might seem that he was little changed, but a closer inspection would have awakened some surprise that the lapse of little more than a year could have changed him so much. The youthfulness had gone out of his face,—that half-eager, half-wistful look which says so plainly, \"The world is all before me, where to choose;\"—it was now the face of a man among men, who had found his place and his work, who had grappled with many hard problems, and solved some, who was accustomed to deal with serious subjects in a serious way, and who had withal, a definite rule and object of life. In short, it was informed with a positive and noble individuality, born out of suffering, and not yet wholly oblivious of the pangs that had given it birth, but certain, in good time, to attain to the fulness of an inward joy, which, having a deep wellspring of its own, would be little dependent upon the ebb and flow of outward circumstance. \n \n Nor had the year been fruitless of exterior results. Scarcely had Bergan mastered the details of his new office, when his partner, Mr. Youle, was taken sick, and he was left to conduct its affairs pretty much alone. Several cases of importance being in hand, he was thus afforded a rare opportunity to achieve a rapid fame. His reputation already overshadowed that of many of his legal brethren who had greatly the advantage of him in years and experience. \n \n From the first, he had made it an invariable rule never to speak against his clear convictions of right; and it was curious to observe what an influence the knowledge of this fact was beginning to have upon the community. The cause which he embraced, however hopeless its aspect, always commanded a degree of respect, and was watched with a certain reservation of judgment, in consideration of his acknowledged integrity of purpose; while, as a necessary sequence (from which Bergan, in his humility, would have been glad to escape), the cause which he was understood to have declined was apt to be pronounced suspicious in the popular judgment, however it might go in the courts. So certain is the talent which is known to be conjoined with a pure aim and an upright life, to win, soon or late, high place and strong influence, even in a world that disallows its very principle of being! The visible fruits of righteousness commend themselves to all lips, whatever is thought of the root from whence they spring. \n \n Bergan\u0027s desk was littered with papers, but his eyes were studying only the opposite wall, half in abstraction, half in perplexity. Nor did their expression alter much when the door opened, and he rose to greet Mr. Youle, who came in slowly and feebly, leaning on a cane. He was of medium height, with gray hair, a thin face, and a kindly blue eye; and it was easy to see, was on the best of terms with his talented young partner. No room in that ripe intellect and gentle nature for so ignoble a passion as jealousy! \n \n \"There, that will do, Arling,\" he said, humorously, when Bergan had helped him carefully to a chair; \"the old gentleman is as comfortable as he\u0027s likely to be,—or deserves to be, for that matter. Well, how goes on our case?\" \n \n Bergan shook his head, with a faint smile. \"Very badly, I should say,—if anything can be said to go badly, which is so entirely in the hands of Providence. I confess that I can make nothing of it.\" \n \n Mr. Youle looked grave. \"I warned you in the beginning,\" said he, \"that there was not a reasonable peg to hang a line of defence on.\" \n \n \"But I believe the man to be innocent,\" rejoined Bergan. \"And,\" he added, smiling, \"\u0027I warned you, in the beginning,\u0027 that I should never advocate a cause which seemed to be unrighteous, nor refuse one that seemed to be just, though the one should offer me a fortune in fees, and the other not a cent.\" \n \n \"Yes, yes, I know,\" replied Mr. Youle. \"And I must admit that your two rules have worked miraculously well thus far; we have lost but one case, I believe, since you came into the office. Well, well, such a vein of good luck cannot be expected to last forever,—after the nugget, the rock or the sand. But I don\u0027t see how it is that you are so strongly persuaded of Unwick\u0027s innocence.\" \n \n \"You would easily understand, if you had looked into his face once; it is a clean passport to confidence. Besides, there is the unvarying testimony of his past life, as set forth by everybody that knows him.—sober, honest, frank, kind, religious, everything that is desirable. A man does not become a murderer in cold blood, all at once; he has to prepare himself for it by vice, or intemperance, or a course of hard, cold, selfish living. There is always a downward slope, before the final plunge.\" \n \n \"Granted; but I doubt if you can make the jury see it clearly enough to ground a verdict of acquittal upon it, in the face of all that terribly strong circumstantial evidence.\" \n \n Bergan mused for a little time without answering. \"I cannot rid myself,\" he said, at length, \"of a conviction that that son of the murdered man could throw some light on the subject, if he chose.\" \n \n Mr. Youle stared. \"I did not know that he had been suspected, for a moment,\" said he. \n \n \"Nor has he. But he is the one who profits most by the murder, since he is heir-at-law. And what a reckless and disobedient youth he has been!—always on bad terms with his father, when he was at home, and doing nothing but write letters for money, while he was in Europe. By the way, I can\u0027t help wondering if he was in Europe, all this past year; though really, I don\u0027t know why I should doubt it. Well,\"—rising and looking at his watch,—\"it is time to go to court.\" \n \n \"And, as I am feeling better to-day, I think I\u0027ll go along,\" said Mr. Youle. \"Since you seem to think that Providence has the case very specially in His hands,—indeed, I don\u0027t mean it irreverently,—I\u0027d like to see how He conducts it.\" \n \n \"I am glad to think that He is conducting it,\" said Bergan, in a low voice; \"else I should be utterly discouraged.\" \n \n The trial dragged its slow length through the greater part of the morning, without any incident of interest. One witness after another came upon the stand, was examined, and dismissed; each adding something to the weight of evidence against the prisoner, Unwick. The son of the murdered man, Varley by name, sat nearly opposite to Bergan, by the side of the prosecuting attorney; and being of a restless temperament, as well as gifted with extraordinary facility in the use of a pencil, he busied himself, as he listened to the monotonous drone of a witness, with mechanically sketching the faces of the witnesses or the spectators, or scenes and places that he had visited, recalled to his mind by the evidence, or by his own roving thoughts. One of these caught Bergan\u0027s eye, and he furtively watched its progress, while seeming to be occupied with his papers. When finished, it was carelessly dropped on the floor, like those which had preceded it; and the skilful pencil quickly set to work on a new subject. In a moment or two, Bergan dropped one of his papers, in a way to take it well under the table, and immediately stooped to get it. When he reappeared, a close observer might have noticed that the look of patient watchfulness, which his face had worn so long, was gone; but the keenest eyes would have been puzzled to read his present expression. Was it triumph, or thankfulness, or perplexity, or a mixture of all? \n \n Mr. Varley was now put upon the stand, to furnish some small link in the chain of evidence that the prosecution was drawing so skilfully around the prisoner. The little that he was desired to say being said, the opposing counsel politely inquired if Mr. Arling had any questions to ask. \n \n \"One or two, if you please,\" answered Bergan, quietly; and rising, and turning toward the witness, he said:— \n \n \"I believe you stated, Mr. Varley, that you had never seen the place where your father died?\" \n \n \"No; he bought it, and removed to it after I went abroad.\" \n \n \"Have you visited it, since your return?\" \n \n \"I have not. I only got here just before the commencement of this trial, and I have been kept too busy since to find time for the trip.\" \n \n \"Then you have never seen the room where your father came to his death?\" \n \n \"No, certainly not,\" returned the witness, beginning to look a little startled by this unaccountable persistency. \n \n \"Has it ever been very minutely described to you?\" \n \n Varley hesitated;—more, it was evident, to consider what could be the possible drift of the question, than to search his memory for a correct answer. He finally ventured to say that to the best of his recollection he had been favored with no such description. \n \n \"According to my notes of the evidence taken during this trial,\" pursued Bergan, \"the only facts about the room brought out with much distinctness, were the positions of the bedstead and the window near it;—does your memory serve you with any additional particulars?\" \n \n \"N—o,\" faltered the witness, with symptoms of growing uneasiness. \n \n \"Then,\" said Bergan, with very distinct and deliberate emphasis, \"if, as you say, you never have seen this room, nor heard it minutely described, how is it that you have been able to make so accurate a representation of it as this which I hold in my hand?\" \n \n There was a breathless silence, while Bergan held up a small, but distinct, pencil sketch to the view of the pale and trembling witness. \n \n \"This sketch,\" continued Bergan, after waiting a few moments for the answer that did not come, \"as I can vouch, and as many of these witnesses can testify, is an exact representation of the room in question, as it would appear from the head of the bedstead;—the very spot in which, it will be remembered, the prosecution has assumed that the murderer must have been concealed; and where, doubtless, he remained long enough to fix all the details of this sketch in his memory. Here is the peculiar double window, facing the east, and wreathed round with vines, which is so marked a feature of the room, yet which there has been no need to mention, during this trial, except in the most casual way; and here, on the right, are the round table and large armchair, where Mr. Varley wrote, and, on the left, an old-fashioned chest of drawers, with a plaster cast of Shakespeare on top;—all in their proper places, just as I saw them when I visited the room, after undertaking the defence of this case. How is it, I ask again,\" he went on, turning to the witness, \"how is it that you could make this sketch, if you never saw the room?\" \n \n \"Who says he made it?\" demanded the opposing counsel, sharply. \n \n \"I say it,\" calmly replied Bergan. \"I saw him draw it, not half an hour ago, on a piece of the same paper that you are using for your notes, as you can satisfy yourself, if you choose to compare them. Besides,\" he added, looking keenly at the witness, \"Mr. Varley will not deny that he made it.\" \n \n No, plainly he would not, for he was physically incapable of speech. He was shivering as with an ague fit, his knees knocked together, his lips trembled convulsively, but no articulate sound came forth. In another moment, he fell forward heavily on the rail that divided the witness-stand from the lawyers\u0027 table. \n \n \"Carry him out! Give him air!\" cried a dozen voices; \"he has fainted.\" \n \n \"Yes, carry him out,\" said Bergan gravely, and not without a touch of compassion in his voice; \"since he is not on trial, we have no further need of him. But let me recommend that he be not lost sight of, till this present trial is over.\" \n \n And it was over very quickly. The influence of the scene just witnessed was not to be ignored nor overcome. Prosecution and defence were alike glad to waste no time on the road to a foregone conclusion. The summing up, on both sides, was brief almost beyond precedent, the judge\u0027s charge was correspondingly so, and the jury returned a verdict of \"Not Guilty,\" without leaving their seats. \n \n \n \"Well,\" exclaimed Mr. Youle, when he and Bergan had finally succeeded in escaping from the gratitude of Unwick, and the congratulations of friends. \"I must say, I never saw such a sudden turn of events as that, in all my legal experience.\" And after a moment, he added, with unusual gravity, \"It does seem as if the blessing of God were with you, and your two rules, Arling.\" \n \n \"I hope so,\" rejoined Bergan, quietly, \"for I have learned that I can do nothing worth doing, without it.\" \n \n \"I really think,\" mused Mr. Youle, \"if I were to live my life over again, I would adopt your plan. I am afraid that I have helped to save many a scoundrel from deserved punishment, as well as to rob an honest man, now and then, of his just rights; and when one comes to look back on it all, from the stand-point of my age, it does seem as if one might have been in better business. Yes, I believe you are right, Arling; and you have my cordial consent from this time forth, to keep on as you have begun. I confess I thought it was a freak, a whim at first, that would soon give way to the temptations—what we usually call the necessities—of actual, steady practice; but I see that you have a solid principle at the bottom which there\u0027s no shaking. Nevertheless, Arling, you can\u0027t expect that your judgment is going to be infallible,—that you will never mistake the guilty man for the innocent one, and vice versa.\" \n \n \"I do not expect it,\" answered Bergan, seriously. \"Errors in judgment, I take it for granted that I shall make, being mortal; but errors in will, I mean to do my best, with God\u0027s help, to avoid.\" \n \n A plain carriage, with a trim African on the box, was in waiting when the two gentlemen descended the courthouse steps. \n \n \"Come, Arling,\" said Mr. Youle, in a tone of command rather than invitation, \"go home and dine with me; there are several things I want to talk to you about.\" \n \n Bergan hesitated; it was easy to see that the plan did not commend itself to his taste. \n \n \"Never rack your brain for excuses; they won\u0027t serve,\" pursued Mr. Youle, with good-natured peremptoriness; \"I mean to take you with me, whether you will or no. It is time for you to overcome your morbid dislike of society; besides, you will see no one but my own family.\" \n \n Thus urged, Bergan could only take a seat in the carriage, and be driven off; albeit, in direct contravention of his inclinations and habits. For, although, on coming back to life and health from the borders of death, he had been quick to hear, and to heed, the plain, stern call of Duty to work while it is yet day, there had been no gracious response in his heart, as yet, to that softer voice wherewith she enjoins brotherly kindness, as well in gentle, social courtesies and amenities as in deeds of benevolence. Life had become too serious a thing, he thought, to be wasted in trifles such as these. Busy at the centre of the circle, he had lost sight of the circumference; intent upon the weightier matters of the law, he forgot the tithes of mint, anise and cummin, which yet, said the Master, ought not to be left undone. But it was a natural mistake, under the circumstances; and there was still time for him to learn that, in every well-ordered life, there is a place for little things,—little courtesies, little duties, little friends. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59286.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
