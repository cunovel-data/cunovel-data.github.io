{"id":32167,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 13 ESCAPED.","content":"Godfrey Bergan stood motionless for some minutes. His nephew\u0027s persistency had irritated his nerves, if it had not convinced his understanding. Nor was he altogether unimpressed by the solemnity of the young man\u0027s parting words. Though he had not condescended to state the fact to Bergan, it was still true that he had exacted what he considered to be very complete and satisfactory evidence, touching the correctness of Doctor Remy\u0027s antecedents, before giving him his daughter. Yet it was only after he had recapitulated this evidence to himself, point by point, and had also taken into account the doctor\u0027s late brilliant achievements, present high standing, and promising prospects for the future, that he could rid himself of a certain chill weight of responsibility, which seemed somehow to have been flung upon his shoulders by Bergan\u0027s last sentence. On entering the cottage, he met Carice in the hall, encircled by her bridesmaids. He was half pleased, half startled to see that the singular listlessness, amounting to a degree of apathy, which had characterized her for some weeks, had given place to a certain tremulous agitation. A round red spot burned on either cheek, where of late the bloom had been both rare and faint; and her eyes were bright and wistful almost to wildness. With a sudden impulse of tenderness, he put his arms round her, and pressed her to his heart. \"Father,\" she whispered, with her lips close to his ear, \"am I dreaming or mad? I have heard a voice in the air—Bergan\u0027s voice. I was standing by the window, and I heard it distinctly,—no words, only tones,—pleading, pleading, until I thought they would break my heart. Then all at once, they changed to anger,—fierce, bitter anger! And they ended in despair! Father, what could it mean!\" \"My child,\" said Godfrey Bergan, after a pause, and there was a perceptible tremor in his voice, \"you are very weak and nervous, and these wedding gayeties have been too much for you. Go to rest, and sleep away your fatigues and your fancies together; joy cometh in the morning. The wife of Felix Remy will hear no voices in the air. Good-night.\" He unclasped his arms, and her bridesmaids, again clustering round her, led her upstairs in triumph. But no sooner had they freed her from her bridal garniture,—the veil\u0027s soft mistiness, the robe\u0027s heavy, satiny folds, the fragrant orange blossoms, already beginning to fade!—than she put them gently aside. \"Bid me good-night, now,\" she said, with quiet decision. \"I am very tired, and I want to be alone for awhile. Rosa will do the rest.\" There was something in her tone which forbade remonstrance; quickly the door shut out the fresh, young faces, and snowy, fluttering robes. Was she, as she had desired to be, alone? Alas! no. The image evoked by that \"voice in the air,\" had followed her across the threshold, and still faced her with sad, upbraiding eyes. Instinctively, she threw herself upon her knees to exorcise it by the spell of prayer. Though no intelligible word might come to her trembling lips, though not a coherent thought might shape itself in her dizzy brain, she was, nevertheless, prostrate at the foot of the cross, and the Saviour would understand! And so—let us not presume to doubt it—He did, and, moreover, answered. But the ways of Providence are utterly inscrutable; and the answer came in no shape that would have been likely to present itself to her mind, had she been capable of definite thought. She rose from her knees but little comforted. For the delirious disquietude that had taken possession of her, had its physical, not less than its mental, side. The long overstraining of the delicate nerves, the long overburdening of the heart that knew its own bitterness, were fast reaching the point beyond which must needs come fever, or insanity, or death. Nature—often the wisest of physicians, when left to herself—had sought to work restoration by means of the apathy aforementioned, wrapping her mind and heart as with quilted armor; but the events of this night had pierced quite through the soft sheathing, and set every nerve quivering with pain. Unable to remain long in one position, she soon began to pace restlessly up and down the room. She was dimly aware that Rosa had come in, and was waiting her commands; but she never once looked to see with what a disturbed and doubtful face the young negress was regarding her. Getting weary, at last, of her monotonous march to and fro, she went to the window, and leaned out to bathe her fevered temples in the cool night air. Suddenly she cried out;— \"Rosa, see! Is not that a light in the old Hall?\" \"Yes, Miss Carice, it\u0027s just that,\" answered Rosa, impressively. \"It\u0027s in Mr. Arling\u0027s room. He\u0027s here.\" \"Here!\" Carice started, and turned round with eager, expectant eyes. \"No, no,\" Rosa hastened to say, \"not here,—at least, not now.\" \"Not now,\" repeated Carice, wonderingly. \"When was he here, then?\" Rosa hesitated for an instant, and then flung herself at her mistress\u0027s feet. \"I will tell you,\" she cried, vehemently,—\"master may kill me, if he likes, but I will tell you! Mr. Arling was here not much more than half an hour ago.\" Carice smiled,—a strange, wan smile, with no spirit of mirthfulness in it, but something of gentle triumph, as well as relief. \"It was no fancy, then,\" she murmured, softly. Rosa went on. \"I was walking down by the river—with Tom, you know—when I thought it must be getting late, and you might want me, and so I took the short cut through the larches. And who should I see standing there but Mr. Arling, and your father coming to meet him! So I slipped back behind the trees, meaning to come round the other way; but I caught a few words, and then I listened;—I couldn\u0027t help it, Miss Carice, if I\u0027d died for it. For Mr. Arling began to beg and plead that your father wouldn\u0027t let your wedding go on, if he cared anything about your happiness. He said there was something dreadful against Doctor Remy,—oh! Miss Carice, I don\u0027t like to say it, but I think you ought to know,—he said he was a\"—sinking her voice almost to a whisper—\"a murderer.\" Carice\u0027s eyes dilated with horror. \"A murderer!\" she gasped,—\"oh! no, no, Rosa; you could not have heard him right!\" \"Indeed I did,\" rejoined Rosa, firmly. \"That\u0027s the very word he used,—more than once, too. At least, he said there was great reason to believe so; and he begged your father to wait until he could make sure about it. Oh! Miss Carice, I never did like Doctor Remy, but I always liked Mr. Arling, and I don\u0027t believe he\u0027d say a word that wasn\u0027t true. Do pray wait, as he said, until you can find out the whole truth, before you have anything more to say to the doctor. Lock your door, and say you\u0027re sick—I\u0027m sure you look as if you might be—and I\u0027ll promise to keep him out, if he were ten Doctor Remys.\" And Rosa set her teeth and clenched her hands, in a way that promised much for her valor in the cause of her young mistress. Carice put her hand to her brow, and tried to think, but merely succeeded in bewildering herself with images of horror. That frightful word, murderer, continually sounded in her ears, to the effectual hindrance of anything like connected thought. Only one idea presented itself to her confused brain with even tolerable distinctness,—Bergan was near, Bergan was in possession of knowledge that might yet relieve her, to some extent, from a burden too heavy to be borne,—a burden which she ought never to have consented to take upon herself, nor ever would have done, had she not first been bound fast with a torpor that benumbed both feeling and will. Still, having so consented, she would have tried, but for Rosa\u0027s terrible revelation, to endure it patiently. Now, it seemed to her, this was no longer possible. Again she fixed her eyes upon the gleaming light from the old Hall; the only star of hope or suggestion that had yet risen upon her darkness. What could she do, in her mortal terror and bewilderment, but follow it? \"Rosa,\" she said, suddenly, \"I am going to the Hall. I must see Bergan, and hear what he has to say; then I can decide what it is right to do.\" \"And so I would,\" rejoined Rosa, approvingly. \"Just let me slip this dark wrapper on you, and wind this scarf round your head, and well over your face,—so;—why, your own father wouldn\u0027t know you, if he were to meet you! Now, we\u0027ll be off.\" Carice hesitated. \"No, Rosa, that will never do; our absence would be quickly discovered. You must stay and keep the door.\" \"But, Miss Carice, you can\u0027t go alone!\" \"I can, and must. It is the only way to prevent discovery. Remember, no one is to be let in, upon any consideration, until I return.\" \"Let me alone for that,\" responded Rosa, emphatically. And having seen Carice safely down the steps from the upper piazza, and watched her light form till it was lost among the trees, Rosa returned to mount guard over the door of the deserted chamber. Godfrey Bergan had been unaccountably shaken by that brief meeting and parting with his daughter, in the hall. Watching her slender form as it toiled up the staircase, with the languid step that betrays a heavy or a reluctant heart, he sighed to think with what a graceful alacrity she had used to flit upward, as if lifted on invisible wings, her happy smile seeming to make a little illuminated space about her, like the light which is seen irradiating angelic forms, in old pictures. A sudden burden of despondency fell upon his heart, whereof he understood neither the purport, nor whether it bore reference to her or himself, but only knew that it quite unfitted him for playing the part of a gay and gracious host to his guests. Seeing Miss Ferrars coming toward him, with her stereotyped smile, an impulse of flight seized him; and hastily stepping through one of the long windows, he soon found himself once more under the sighing trees, which were swaying to and fro under the first breathings of a rising wind. The night was no longer dark. Here and there, a star looked through the broken clouds, and lighted him to the river\u0027s bank, down which he walked slowly; torturing himself, as he went, with that weary after-birth of doubts and questions, which often follows hard upon the accomplishment of a cherished purpose. Had he done well in wedding Carice to the doctor? Had he not done wrong in refusing to listen to Bergan, at least with courtesy and calmness? Was it barely possible that there could have been some small grain of truth at the bottom of the young man\u0027s turbid story? What was the meaning of that odd, wild look in Carice\u0027s eyes? Had he been thrusting himself, as it were, into the awful place of Providence, only, by reason of his human short-sightedness, to work irremediable ruin? At that moment, a dark, slender woman\u0027s figure hurried past him, toward the ruined foot-bridge, which was near at hand. \"One of my brother\u0027s servants, who has stolen over to dance with mine,\" he said to himself, turning idly to watch her progress. To his utter amazement, at the further end, he seemed to see her cast herself deliberately into the water! Godfrey Bergan was a practised swimmer, and, after the first motionless moment of astonishment, he threw off his coat, plunged into the stream, which, at this point, was neither rapid nor deep, and swam rapidly toward the spot where he had seen the body disappear. Here, the water was scarcely up to his armpits; in a few moments, he had caught the floating garments, and borne the lifeless form to land. The heavy head fell back on his arm; the scarf trailed away from the white features; he recognized Carice! With a thick, muffled cry of horror, the father sank upon his knees, not so much of devotional intent, as crushed under the double-weight of his physical burden and mental anguish. \"Oh, God! have mercy upon us!\" he ejaculated, brokenly,—\"I have driven my child to suicide!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2089/59284.html","bookId":526,"book":{"id":526,"title":"Holden with the Cords","description":"简介： In sending forth another book belonging to the class known as religious novels, the author is moved to say a word to the critics who received a former one with so pleasant a mixture of praise and deprecation.
