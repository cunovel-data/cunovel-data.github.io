{"id":23790,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII—THE FEAR OF KNOWLEDGE","content":"The journey back to London was like the waking moments of a dream. He gazed out of the carriage window. He couldn’t bear to look at Hal; his eyes seemed dead, as though all the mind behind them was full of darkened passages. It wasn’t easy to be brave just now, so he turned his face away from him. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Teddy.” There was no one in the carriage but themselves. “Did she ever say anything about me?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “She said that you were fond of her.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Ah, yes, but I don’t mean that. Did she ever say how she felt herself?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “About you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “About me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n There was hunger in Hal’s voice—hunger in the way he listened for the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Not—not exactly. But she liked you immensely. She really did, Hal. She looked forward most awfully to your coming.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Any child would have done that when a man brought her presents. Then she didn’t say she loved me? No, she wouldn’t say that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Hal spoke bitterly. Teddy felt that Desire was being accused and sprang to her defense. “I don’t see how you could expect her to love you after what you had done.” The man looked up sharply. “After what I had done! D’you mean kidnaping her, or something further back?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I mean taking her away from her mother.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Hal laughed gloomily. “No, as you say, a person with no claims on her couldn’t expect her to love him after that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Sinking his head forward, he relapsed into silence and sat staring at the seat opposite. When the train was galloping through the outskirts of London, he spoke again. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’ve dragged you into something that you don’t understand. Don’t try to understand it; but there’s something I want to say to you. If ever you’re tempted to do wrong, remember me. If ever you’re tempted to get love the wrong way, be strong enough to do without it. It isn’t worth having. You have to lie and cheat to get it at first, and you have to lie and cheat to keep some of it when it’s ended.” He turned his face away, speaking shamefully and hurriedly. “I sinned once, a long while ago—I don’t know whether you’ve guessed. I’m still paying for it. You’re paying for it. One day that little girl may have to pay the biggest price of any of us. I was trying to save her from that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Through the window shabby rows of cabs showed up. A porter jumped on the step, asking if there was any luggage. Hal waved him back. Turning to Teddy, he said, “When you’ve sinned, you never know where the paying ends. It touches a thousand lives with its selfishness. Remember me one day, and be careful.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Driving home in the hansom, he referred but once to the subject “I’ve made you suffer. I don’t know how much—boys never tell. I owed you something; that’s why I spoke to you just now.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Teddy’s arrival home scattered the last mists of his dream-world. As the cab drew up before the house, the door flew open and his father burst out, bundling a mildly protesting old gentleman down the steps. \\n\\n \\n\\n “No, I don’t paint little pigs,” he was shouting, “and I don’t paint little girls sucking their thumbs and cooing, ‘I’m baby.’ You’ve come to the wrong shop, old man; no offense. I’m an artist; the man you’re looking for is a sign-painter. Good evening.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The door banged in the old gentleman’s face. Jimmie Boy was so enjoying his anger that he didn’t notice that in closing the door he was shutting out his son. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Teddy had been admitted by Jane, he heard his mother’s voice dodging through his father’s laughter like a child through a crowd. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You needn’t have been so sharp with him, Jimmie. He only wanted to buy the kind of pictures you don’t paint You can’t expect every one to understand. Now he’ll go the rounds and talk about you, and you’ll have another enemy. Why do you do it, my silly old pirate?” \\n\\n \\n\\n The old pirate pretended to become suspicious that his wife was trying to lower his standards—trying to persuade him to paint the rubbish that would sell She protested her innocence. Long after Teddy had made his presence known the argument continued, half in banter, half in seriousness. Then it took the familiar turning which led to a discussion of finance. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stole away. The impatient world had swept him back into its maelstrom of realities. It had taken away his breath and staggered his courage. Hal’s harangue on the consequences of sin had made him see sin everywhere. He saw his father as sinning when he indulged his genius by pushing would-be purchasers down his steps. Hal was right—he and Dearie would have to pay for that; all their lives they had been paying for his father’s temperament. They had had to go short of everything because he would insist on trying to exchange his dreams for money. \\n\\n \\n\\n He wandered out into the garden where his pigeons were flying. Instinctively his steps led him to the stable. From the stalls he dragged out The Garden Enclosed, which was to have made his father famous. He gazed at it; as he gazed, the world seemed better. The world must be a happy place so long as there were women in it like that. People said that his father hadn’t succeeded; but he had by being true to what he knew to be best. \\n\\n \\n\\n He climbed the ladder to the studio where, through long years of discouragement, his father had refused to stoop below himself. Leaning from the window, he gazed into the garden. The dusty smell of the ivy came to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n There in the darkness his mother found him. Coming in quietly, she crouched beside him, taking his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mother, you’re very beautiful.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Her heart quickened. “Something’s happened. Once you wouldn’t have said that.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’ve been thinking about so many things,” he whispered, “about how it must have helped a man to have had some one like you always to himself.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You were thinking,” she brushed his cheek with hers, “you were thinking about yourself—about the long, long future.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes.” His voice scarcely reached her. “I was growing frightened because of Hal. I was feeling kind of lonely. Then I thought of you and Jimmie Boy. It would be fearful to grow up like Hal.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You won’t, Teddy.” \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a long silence. They could hear each other’s thoughts ticking. At last he whispered, “Desire said she never had a father.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Poor little girl! You must have guessed?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Hal?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Choking back her tears, she nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Things like that——” He broke off, staring into the darkness. “Things like that make a boy frightened, when first they’re told him.” She drew his head down to her shoulder. He lay there without speaking, feeling sheltered for the moment. All the threats of manhood, the fears that he might fail, the terror lest he might miss the highest things like Hal, drew away into the distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the night, when he awoke and they returned, he drove them off with a new purpose. The pity and white chivalry of his boyhood were aflame with what he had learnt. Until he met her again, he would keep himself spotless. She should be to him what the Holy Grail was to Sir Gala-had. He would fight to be good and great not for his own sake—that would be lonely; but that he might be strong, when he became a man, to pay the price for Desire that Hal’s sin had imposed on her. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1871/54126.html","bookId":814,"book":{"id":814,"title":"Slaves Of Freedom","description":"简介： The excessively thin man glanced up from the puddle of lime that he was stirring and regarded the excessively fat man with a smile of meek interrogation....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1871","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
