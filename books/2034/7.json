He\u0027d probably been an idiot to rely on Damon in the first place. But when he reached the backyard, there was a shimmer of motion among the black walnut trees. His eyes, sharper than a human\u0027s because they were adapted for hunting, made out the darker shadow leaning against a trunk. \"You took your time getting back.\" \"I had to see the others home safe. And I had to eat.\" \"Animal blood,\" Damon said contemptuously, eyes fixed on a tiny round stain on Stefan\u0027s T-shirt. \"Rabbit, from the smell of it. That seems appropriate somehow, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Damon-I\u0027ve given Bonnie and Meredith vervain too.\" \"A wise precaution,\" Damon said distinctly, and showed his teeth. A familiar surge of irritation welled up in Stefan. Why did Damon always have to be so difficult? Talking with him was like walking between land mines. \"I\u0027ll be going now,\" Damon continued, swinging his jacket over one shoulder. \"I\u0027ve got business of my own to take care of.\" He tossed a devastating grin over his shoulder. \"Don\u0027t wait up.\" \"Damon.\" Damon half turned, not looking but listening. \"The last thing we need is some girl in this town screaming \u0027Vampire!\u0027 \" Stefan said. \"Or showing the signs, either. These people have been through it before; they\u0027re not ignorant.\" \"I\u0027ll bear that in mind.\" It was said ironically, but it was the closest thing to a promise Stefan had ever gotten from his brother in his life. \"And, Damon?\" \"Now what?\" \"Thank you.\" It was too much. Damon whipped around, his eyes cold and uninviting, a stranger\u0027s eyes. \"Don\u0027t expect anything of me, little brother,\" he said dangerously. \"Because you\u0027ll be wrong every time. And don\u0027t think you can manipulate me, either. Those three humans may follow you, but I won\u0027t. I\u0027m here for reasons of my own.\" He was gone before Stefan could gather words for a reply. It wouldn\u0027t have mattered anyway. Damon never listened to anything he said. Damon never even called him by name. It was always the scornful \"little brother.\" And now Damon was off to prove how unreliable he was, Stefan thought. Wonderful. He\u0027d do something particularly vicious just to show Stefan he was capable of it. It was no use. He couldn\u0027t keep his mind on the puzzle. He was tired and lonely and in desperate need of comfort. And the stark truth was that there was no comfort to be had. Elena, he thought, you lied to me. It was the one thing she\u0027d insisted on, the one thing she\u0027d always promised. \"Whatever happens, Stefan, I\u0027ll be with you. Tell me you believe that.\" And he had answered, helpless in her spell, \"Oh, Elena, I believe it. Whatever happens, we\u0027ll be together.\" But she had left him. Not by choice maybe, but what did that matter in the end? She had left him and gone away. There were times when all he wanted was to follow her. Think about something else, anything else, he told himself, but it was too late. Once unleashed, the images of Elena swirled around him, too painful to bear, too beautiful to push away. The first time he\u0027d kissed her. The shock of dizzy sweetness when his mouth met hers. And after that, shock after shock, but at some deeper level. As if she were reaching down to the core of himself, a core he\u0027d almost forgotten. Frightened, he\u0027d felt his defenses tear away. All his secrets, all his resistance, all the tricks he used to keep other people at arm\u0027s length. Elena had ripped through them all, exposing his vulnerability. Exposing his soul. And in the end, he found that it was what he wanted. He wanted Elena to see him without defenses, without walls. He wanted her to know him for what he was. Terrifying? Yes. When she\u0027d discovered his secret at last, when she\u0027d found him feeding on that bird, he had cringed in shame. He was sure that she\u0027d turn away from the blood on his mouth in horror. In disgust. But when he looked into her eyes that night, he saw understanding. Forgiveness. Love. Her love had healed him. And that was when he knew they could never be apart. Other memories surged up and Stefan held on to them, even though the pain tore into him like claws. Sensations. The feel of Elena against him, supple in his arms. The brush of her hair on his cheek, light as a moth\u0027s wing. The curve of her lips, the taste of them. The impossible midnight blue of her eyes. But Bonnie had reached Elena. Elena\u0027s spirit, her soul, was still somewhere near. Of anyone, he should be able to summon it. He had Power at his command. And he had more right than anyone to seek her. He knew how it was done. Shut your eyes. Picture the person you want to draw near. That was easy. He could see Elena, feel her, smell her. Then call them, let your longing reach out into the emptiness. Open yourself and let your need be felt. Easier still. He didn\u0027t give a damn about the danger. He gathered all his yearning, all his pain, and sent it out searching like a prayer. And felt... nothing. Only void and his own loneliness. Only silence. His Power wasn\u0027t the same as Bonnie\u0027s. He couldn\u0027t reach the one thing he loved most, the one thing that mattered to him. He had never felt so alone in his life. \"You want what?\" Bonnie said. \"Some sort of records about the history of Fell\u0027s Church. Particularly about the founders,\" Stefan said. They were all sitting in Meredith\u0027s car, which was parked a discreet distance behind Vickie\u0027s house. It was dusk of the next day and they had just returned from Sue\u0027s funeral-all but Stefan. \"This has something to do with Sue, doesn\u0027t it?\" Meredith\u0027s dark eyes, always so level and intelligent, probed Stefan\u0027s. \"You think you\u0027ve solved the mystery.\" \"Possibly,\" he admitted. He had spent the day thinking. He\u0027d put the pain of last night behind him, and once again he was in control. Although he could not reach Elena, he could justify her faith in him-he could do what she wanted done. And there was a comfort in work, in concentration. In keeping all emotion away. He added, \"I have an idea about what might have happened, but it\u0027s a long shot and I don\u0027t want to talk about it until I\u0027m sure.\" \"Why?\" demanded Bonnie. Such a contrast to Meredith, Stefan thought. Hair as red as fire and a spirit to go with it. That delicate heart-shaped face and fair, translucent skin were deceptive, though. Bonnie was smart and resourceful-even if she was only beginning to find that out herself. \"Because if I\u0027m wrong, an innocent person might get hurt. Look, at this point it\u0027s just an idea. But I promise if I find any evidence tonight to back it up, I\u0027ll tell you all about it.\" \"You could talk with Mrs. Grimesby,\" Meredith suggested. \"She\u0027s the town librarian, and she knows a lot about the founding of Fell\u0027s Church.\" \"Or there\u0027s always Honoria,\" Bonnie said. \"I mean, she was one of the founders.\" Stefan looked at her quickly. \"I thought Honoria Fell had stopped communicating with you,\" he said carefully. Stefan was surprised. He didn\u0027t entirely like the idea of Elena\u0027s journal on display. But Honoria\u0027s records might be exactly what he was looking for. Honoria had not just been a wise woman; she had been well versed in the supernatural. A witch. \"The library\u0027s closed by now, though,\" Meredith said. \"That\u0027s even better,\" said Stefan. \"No one will know what information we\u0027re interested in. Two of us can go down there and break in, and the other two can stay here. Meredith, if you\u0027ll come with me-\" \"I\u0027d like to stay here, if you don\u0027t mind,\" she said. \"I\u0027m tired,\" she added in explanation, seeing his expression. \"And this way I can get my watch over with and get home earlier. Why don\u0027t you and Matt go and Bonnie and I stay here?\" Stefan was still looking at her. \"Okay,\" he said slowly. \"Fine. If it\u0027s all right with Matt.\" Matt shrugged. \"That\u0027s it, then. It might take us a couple of hours or more. You two stay in the car with the doors locked. You should be safe enough that way.\" If he was right in his suspicions, there wouldn\u0027t be any more attacks for a while-a few days at least. Bonnie and Meredith should be safe. But he couldn\u0027t help wonder what was behind Meredith\u0027s suggestion. Not simple tiredness, he was sure. \"By the way, where\u0027s Damon?\" Bonnie asked as he and Matt started to leave. Stefan felt his stomach muscles tighten. \"I don\u0027t know.\" He had been waiting for someone to ask that. He hadn\u0027t seen his brother since last night, and he had no idea what Damon might be doing. \"He\u0027ll show up eventually,\" he said, and closed the door on Meredith\u0027s, \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of.\" He and Matt walked to the library in silence, keeping to the shadows, skirting areas of light. He couldn\u0027t afford to be seen. Stefan had come back to help Fell\u0027s Church, but he felt sure Fell\u0027s Church didn\u0027t want his help. He was a stranger again, an intruder here. They would hurt him if they caught him. The library lock was easy to pick, just a simple spring mechanism. And the journals were right where Bonnie had said they would be. Stefan forced his hand away from Elena\u0027s journal. Inside was the record of Elena\u0027s last days, in her own handwriting. If he started thinking about that now... He concentrated on the leather-bound book beside it. The faded ink on the yellowing pages was hard to read, but after a few minutes his eyes got accustomed to the dense, intricate writing with its elaborate curlicues. It was the story of Honoria Fell and her husband, who with the Smallwoods and a few other families had come to this place when it was still virgin wilderness. They had faced not only the dangers of isolation and hunger but of native wildlife. Honoria told the story of their battle to survive simply and clearly, without sentimentality. With a prickling at the back of his neck, he reread the entry carefully. At last he leaned back and shut his eyes. He\u0027d been right. There was no longer any doubt in his mind. And that meant he must also be right about what was going on in Fell\u0027s Church now. For an instant, bright sickness washed over him, and an anger that made him want to rip and tear and hurt something. Sue. Pretty Sue who had been Elena\u0027s friend had died for... that. A blood ritual, an obscene initiation. It made him want to kill. But then the rage faded, replaced by a fierce determination to stop what was happening and set things right. I promise you, he whispered to Elena in his own mind. I will stop it somehow. No matter what. He looked up to find Matt looking at him. Elena\u0027s journal was in Matt\u0027s hand, closing itself over his thumb. Just then Matt\u0027s eyes looked as dark a blue as Elena\u0027s. Too dark, full of turmoil and grief and something like bitterness. \"You found it,\" Matt said. \"And it\u0027s bad.\" \"Yes.\" \"It would be.\" Matt pushed Elena\u0027s journal back into the case and stood. There was a ring almost of satisfaction in his voice. Like somebody who\u0027s just proved a point. \"I could have saved you the trouble of coming here.\" Matt surveyed the darkened library, jingling change in his pocket. A casual observer might have thought he was relaxed, but his voice betrayed him. It was raw with strain. \"You just think of the worst thing you can imagine and that\u0027s always the truth,\" he said. \"Matt...\" Sudden concern stabbed at Stefan. He\u0027d been too preoccupied since coming back to Fell\u0027s Church to look at Matt properly. Now he realized that he\u0027d been unforgivably stupid. Something was terribly wrong. Matt\u0027s whole body was rigid with tension lying just under the surface. And Stefan could sense the anguish, the desperation in his mind. \"Matt, what is it?\" he said quietly. He got up and crossed to the other boy. \"Is it something I did?\" \"I\u0027m fine.\" \"You\u0027re shaking.\" It was true. Fine tremors were running through the taut muscles. \"I said I\u0027m fine!\" Matt swung away from him, shoulders hunched defensively. \"Anyway, what could you have done to upset me? Besides taking my girl and getting her killed, I mean?\" This stab was different, it was somewhere around Stefan\u0027s heart and it went straight through. Like the blade that had killed him once upon a time. He tried to breathe around it, not trusting himself to speak. \"It was the truth.\" Stefan waited a moment and then added, levelly, \"But it\u0027s not the whole problem, is it?\" Matt didn\u0027t answer. He stared at the floor, pushing something invisible with the side of one shoe. Just when Stefan was about to give up, he turned with a question of his own. \"What\u0027s the world really like?\" \"What\u0027s... what?\" \"The world. You\u0027ve seen a lot of it, Stefan. You\u0027ve got four or five centuries on the rest of us, right? So what\u0027s the deal? I mean, is it basically the kind of place worth saving or is it essentially a pile of crap?\" Stefan shut his eyes. \"Oh.\" \"And what about people, huh, Stefan? The human race. Are we the disease or just a symptom? I mean, you take somebody like-like Elena.\" Matt\u0027s voice shook briefly, but he went on. \"Elena died to keep the town safe for girls like Sue. And now Sue\u0027s dead. And it\u0027s all happening again. It\u0027s never over. We can\u0027t win. So what does that tell you?\" \"Matt.\" \"What I\u0027m really asking is, what\u0027s the point? Is there some cosmic joke I\u0027m not getting? Or is the whole thing just one big freaking mistake? Do you understand what I\u0027m trying to say here?\" \"I understand, Matt.\" Stefan sat down and ran his hands through his hair. \"If you\u0027ll shut up a minute, I\u0027ll try to answer you.\" Matt drew up a chair and straddled it. \"Great. Take your best shot.\" His eyes were hard and challenging, but underneath Stefan saw the bewildered hurt that had been festering there. \"I\u0027ve seen a lot of evil, Matt, more than you can imagine,\" Stefan said. \"I\u0027ve even lived it. It\u0027s always going to be a part of me, no matter how I fight it. Sometimes I think the whole human race is evil, much less my kind. And sometimes I think that enough of both our races is evil that it doesn\u0027t matter what happens to the rest. \"When you get down to it, though, I don\u0027t know any more than you do. I can\u0027t tell you if there\u0027s a point or if things are ever going to turn out all right.\" Stefan looked straight into Matt\u0027s eyes and spoke deliberately. \"But I\u0027ve got another question for you. So what?\" Matt stared. \"So what?\" \"Yeah. So what.\" \"Yeah, so what?\" Stefan leaned forward. \"So what are you going to do, Matt Honeycutt, if every bad thing you\u0027ve said is true? What are you going to do personally? Are you going to stop fighting and swim with the sharks?\" Matt was grasping the back of his chair. \"What are you talking about?\" \"You can do that, you know. Damon says so all the time. You can join up with the evil side, the winning side. And nobody can really blame you, because if the universe is that way, why shouldn\u0027t you be that way too?\" \"Like hell!\" Matt exploded. His blue eyes were searing and he had half risen from his chair. \"That\u0027s Damon\u0027s way, maybe! But just because it\u0027s hopeless doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s all right to stop fighting. Even if I knew it was hopeless, I\u0027d still have to try. I have to try, damn it!\" \"I know.\" Stefan settled back and smiled faintly. It was a tired smile, but it showed the kinship he felt right then with Matt. And in a moment he saw by Matt\u0027s face that Matt understood. \"I know because I feel the same way,\" Stefan continued. \"There\u0027s no excuse for giving up just because it looks like we\u0027re going to lose. We have to try-because the other choice is to surrender.\" \"I\u0027m not ready to surrender anything,\" Matt said through his teeth. He looked as if he\u0027d fought his way back to a fire inside him that had been burning all along. \"Ever,\" he said. \"Yeah, well, \u0027ever\u0027 is a long time,\" Stefan said. \"But for what it\u0027s worth, I\u0027m going to try not to either. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s possible, but I\u0027m going to try.\" \"That\u0027s all anybody can do,\" Matt said. Slowly, he pushed himself off the chair and stood straight. The tension was gone from his muscles, and his eyes were the clear, almost piercing blue eyes Stefan remembered. \"Okay,\" he said quietly. \"If you found what you came for, we\u0027d better get back to the girls.\" Stefan thought, his mind switching gears. \"Matt, if I\u0027m right about what\u0027s going on, the girls should be okay for a while. But you go ahead and take over the watch from them. As long as I\u0027m here there\u0027s something I\u0027d like to read up on-by a guy named Gervase of Tilbury, who lived in the early 1200s.\" \"Even before your time, eh?\" Matt said, and Stefan gave him the ghost of a smile. They stood for a moment, looking at each other. \"All right. I guess I\u0027ll see you at Vickie\u0027s.\" Matt turned to the door, then hesitated. Abruptly, he turned again and held out his hand. \"Stefan-I\u0027m glad you came back.\" Stefan gripped it. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it\" was all he said, but inside he felt a warmth that took away the stabbing pain. And some of the loneliness, too.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-7.html","bookId":2034,"book":{"id":2034,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: As a psychic, Bonnie has dreams of Elena in the Other World.
