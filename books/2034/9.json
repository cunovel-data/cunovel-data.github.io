We made it, she thought. Whatever happens tonight, Matt and Meredith and I made it to graduation. There had been times this last school year when she had seriously doubted they would.\\n\\n Considering Sue\u0027s death, Bonnie had expected the graduation ceremony to be listless or grim. Instead, there was a sort of frenzied excitement about it. As if everyone was celebrating being alive-before it was too late.\\n\\n It turned into rowdiness as parents surged forward and the senior class of Robert E. Lee fragmented in all directions, whooping and acting up. Bonnie retrieved her cap and then looked up into her mother\u0027s camera lens.\\n\\n Act normal, that\u0027s what\u0027s important, she told herself. She caught a glimpse of Elena\u0027s aunt Judith and Robert Maxwell, the man Aunt Judith had recently married, standing on the sidelines. Robert was holding Elena\u0027s little sister, Margaret, by the hand. When they saw her, they smiled bravely, but she felt uncomfortable when they came her way.\\n\\n \"Oh, Miss Gilbert-I mean, Mrs. Maxwell-you shouldn\u0027t have,\" she said as Aunt Judith handed her a small bouquet of pink roses.\\n\\n Aunt Judith smiled through the tears in her eyes. \"This would have been a very special day for Elena,\" she said. \"I want it to be special for you and Meredith, too.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Aunt Judith.\" Impulsively, Bonnie threw her arms around the older woman. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" she whispered. \"You know how much.\"\\n\\n \"We all miss her,\" Aunt Judith said. Then she pulled back and smiled again and the three of them left. Bonnie turned from looking at them with a lump in her throat to look at the madly celebrating crowd.\\n\\n There was Ray Hernandez, the boy she\u0027d gone to Homecoming with, inviting everybody to a party at his house that night. There was Tyler\u0027s friend Dick Carter, making a fool of himself as usual. Tyler was smiling brazenly as his father took picture after picture. Matt was listening, with an unimpressed look, to some football recruiter from James Mason University. Meredith was standing nearby, holding a bouquet of red roses and looking pensive.\\n\\n Vickie wasn\u0027t there. Her parents had kept her home, saying she was in no state to go out. Caroline wasn\u0027t there either. She was staying in the apartment in Heron. Her mother had told Bonnie\u0027s mother she had the flu, but Bonnie knew the truth. Caroline was scared.\\n\\n And maybe she\u0027s right, Bonnie thought, moving toward Meredith. Caroline may be the only one of us to make it through next week.\\n\\n Look normal, act normal. She reached Meredith\u0027s group. Meredith was wrapping the red-and-black tassel from her cap around the bouquet, twisting it between elegant, nervous fingers.\\n\\n \"Be careful with that; you\u0027ll ruin it,\" she said aloud.\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s look of thoughtful melancholy didn\u0027t change. She went on staring at the tassel, kinking it up. \"It doesn\u0027t seem fair,\" she said, \"that we should get these and Elena shouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n \"I know; it\u0027s awful,\" Bonnie said. But she kept her tone light. \"I wish there was something we could do about it, but we can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all wrong,\" Meredith went on, as if she hadn\u0027t heard. \"Here we are out in the sunlight, graduating, and there she is under that-stone.\"\\n\\n \"I know, I know,\" Bonnie said in a soothing tone. \"Meredith, you\u0027re getting yourself all upset. Why don\u0027t you try to think about something else? Look, after you go out to dinner with your parents, do you want to go to Raymond\u0027s party? Even if we\u0027re not invited, we can crash it.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Meredith said with startling vehemence. \"I don\u0027t want to go to any party. How can you even think of that, Bonnie? How can you be so shallow?\"\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ve got to do something ...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m doing. I\u0027m going up to the cemetery after dinner. I\u0027m going to put this on Elena\u0027s grave. She\u0027s the one who deserves it.\" Meredith\u0027s knuckles were white as she shook the tassel in her hand.\\n\\n \"Meredith, don\u0027t be an idiot. You can\u0027t go up there, especially at night. That\u0027s crazy. Matt would say the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m not asking Matt. I\u0027m not asking anybody. I\u0027m going by myself.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t. God, Meredith, I always thought you had some brains-\"\\n\\n \"And I always thought you had some sensitivity. But obviously you don\u0027t even want to think about Elena. Or is it just because you want her old boyfriend for yourself?\"\\n\\n Bonnie slapped her.\\n\\n It was a good hard slap, with plenty of energy behind it. Meredith drew in a sharp breath, one hand to her reddening cheek. Everyone around them was staring.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it for you, Bonnie McCullough,\" Meredith said after a moment, in a voice of deadly quiet. \"I don\u0027t ever want to speak to you again.\" She turned on her heel and walked away:\\n\\n \"Never would be too soon for me!\" Bonnie shouted at her retreating back.\\n\\n Eyes were hastily averted as Bonnie looked around her. But there was no question that she and Meredith had been the center of attention for several minutes past. Bonnie bit the inside of her cheek to keep a straight face and walked over to Matt, who had lost the recruiter.\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think the slap was too much? We didn\u0027t really plan that; I was just sort of going with the moment. Maybe it was too obvious...\"\\n\\n \"It was fine, just fine.\" Matt was looking preoccupied. Not that dull, apathetic, turned-in look of the last few months, but distinctly abstracted.\\n\\n \"What is it? Something wrong with the plan?\" Bonnie said.\\n\\n \"No, no. Listen, Bonnie, I\u0027ve been thinking. You were the one to discover Mr. Tanner\u0027s body in the Haunted House last Halloween, right?\"\\n\\n Bonnie was startled. She gave an involuntary shiver of distaste. \"Well, I was the first one to know he was dead, really dead, instead of just playing his scene. Why on earth do you want to talk about that now?\"\\n\\n \"Because maybe you can answer this question. Could Mr. Tanner have got a knife in Damon?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Well, could he?\"\\n\\n \"I...\" Bonnie blinked and frowned. Then she shrugged. \"I suppose so. Sure. It was a Druid sacrifice scene, remember, and the knife we used was a real knife. We talked about using a fake one, but since Mr. Tanner was going to be lying right there beside it, we figured it was safe enough. As a matter of fact...\" Bonnie\u0027s frown deepened. \"I think when I found the body, the knife was in a different place from where we\u0027d set it in the beginning. But then, some kid could have moved it. Matt, why are you asking?\"\\n\\n \"Just something Damon said to me,\" Matt said, staring off into the distance again. \"I wondered if it could be the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" Bonnie waited for him to say more, but he didn\u0027t. \"Well,\" she said finally, \"if it\u0027s all cleared up, can you come back to Earth, please? And don\u0027t you think you should maybe put your arm around me? Just to show you\u0027re on my side and there\u0027s no chance you\u0027re going to show up at Elena\u0027s grave tonight with Meredith?\"\\n\\n Matt snorted, but the faraway look disappeared from his eyes. For just a brief instant he put his arm around her and squeezed.\\n\\n D..j. vu, Meredith thought as she stood at the gate to the cemetery. The problem was, she couldn\u0027t remember exactly which of her previous experiences in the graveyard this night reminded her of. There had been so many.\\n\\n In a way, it had all started here. It had been here that Elena had sworn not to rest until Stefan belonged to her. She\u0027d made Bonnie and Meredith swear to help her, too -in blood. How suitable, Meredith thought now.\\n\\n And it had been here that Tyler had assaulted Elena the night of the Homecoming dance. Stefan had come to the rescue, and that had been the beginning for them. This graveyard had seen a lot.\\n\\n This graveyard had been the beginning, and the end as well. And maybe there would be another end tonight.\\n\\n Meredith started walking.\\n\\n I wish you were here now, Alaric, she thought. I could use your optimism and your savvy about the supernatural-and I wouldn\u0027t mind your muscles, either.\\n\\n Elena\u0027s headstone was in the new cemetery, of course, where the grass was still tended and the graves marked with wreaths of flowers. The stone was very simple, almost plain looking, with a brief inscription. Meredith bent down and placed her bouquet of roses in front of it. Then, slowly, she added the red-and-black tassel from her cap. In this dim light, both colors looked the same, like dried blood. She knelt and folded her hands quietly. And she waited.\\n\\n All around her the cemetery was still. It seemed to be waiting with her, breath held in anticipation. The rows of white stones stretched on either side of her, shining faintly. Meredith listened for any sound.\\n\\n And then she heard one. Heavy footsteps.\\n\\n With her head down, she stayed quiet, pretending she noticed nothing.\\n\\n The footsteps sounded closer, not even bothering to be stealthy.\\n\\n \"Hi, Meredith.\"\\n\\n Meredith looked around quickly. \"Oh-Tyler,\" she said. \"You scared me. I thought you were-never mind.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Tyler\u0027s lips skinned back in an unsettling grin. \"Well, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re disappointed. But it\u0027s me, just me and nobody else.\"\\n\\n \"What are you doing here, Tyler? No good parties?\"\\n\\n \"I could ask you the same question.\" Tyler\u0027s eyes dropped to the headstone and the tassel and his face darkened. \"But I guess I already know the answer. You\u0027re here for her. Elena Gilbert, A Light in Darkness,\" he read sarcastically.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Meredith said evenly. \" \u0027Elena\u0027 means light, you know. And she was certainly surrounded by darkness. It almost beat her, but she won in the end.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" Tyler said, and worked his jaw meditatively, squinting. \"But you know, Meredith, it\u0027s a funny thing about darkness. There\u0027s always more of it waiting in the wings.\"\\n\\n \"Like tonight,\" Meredith said, looking up at the sky. It was clear and dotted with faint stars. \"It\u0027s very dark tonight, Tyler. But sooner or later the sun will come up.\"\\n\\n Just like he showed Elena, Meredith thought. In a way she was enjoying this verbal fencing, but she never lost sight of what she had come here for. Her cold fingers dipped into her jacket pocket and found the tiny sprig of vervain there. \"That\u0027s all right, Tyler. I think I\u0027d prefer to stay here.\"\\n\\n \"You sure about that? A cemetery\u0027s a dangerous place to be alone.\"\\n\\n Unquiet spirits, Meredith thought. She looked right at him. \"I know.\"\\n\\n He was grinning again, displaying teeth like tombstones. \"Anyway, you can see it from here if you have good eyes. Look that way, toward the old graveyard. Now, do you see something sort of shining red in the middle?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" There was a pale luminosity over the trees in the east. Meredith kept her eyes on it.\\n\\n \"Aw, come on, Meredith. You\u0027re not trying. Once the moon\u0027s up you\u0027ll see it better.\"\\n\\n \"Tyler, I can\u0027t waste any more time here. I\u0027m going.\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not,\" he said. And then, as her fingers tightened on the vervain, encompassing it in her fist, he added in a wheedling voice, \"I mean, you\u0027re not going until I tell you the story of that headstone, are you? It\u0027s a great story. See, the headstone is made of red marble, the only one of its kind in the whole graveyard. And that ball on top-see it?-that must weigh about a ton. But it moves. It turns whenever a Smallwood is going to die. My grandfather didn\u0027t believe that; he put a scratch on it right down the front. He used to come out and check it every month or so. Then one day he came and found the scratch in the rear. The ball had turned completely backward. He did everything he could to turn it around, but he couldn\u0027t. It was too heavy. And that night, in bed, he died. They buried him under it.\"\\n\\n \"He probably had a heart attack from overexertion,\" Meredith said caustically, but her palms were tingling.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re funny, aren\u0027t you? Always so cool. Always so together. Takes a lot to make you scream, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m leaving, Tyler. I\u0027ve had enough.\"\\n\\n He let her walk a few paces, then said, \"You screamed that night at Caroline\u0027s, though, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Meredith turned back. \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n Tyler rolled his eyes. \"Give me credit for a little intelligence, okay? I know a lot, Meredith. For instance, I know what\u0027s in your pocket.\"\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s fingers stilled. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n Meredith backed away a step.\\n\\n \"You think that\u0027s going to help you, don\u0027t you? But I\u0027m going to tell you a secret.\"\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s eyes measured the distance between herself and the path. She kept her face calm, but a violent shaking was beginning inside her. She didn\u0027t know if she was going to be able to pull this off.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going anywhere, babe,\" Tyler said, and a large hand clasped Meredith\u0027s wrist. It was hot and damp where she could feel it below her jacket cuff. \"You\u0027re going to stay right here for your surprise.\" His body was hunched now, his head thrust forward, and there was an exultant leer on his lips.\\n\\n \"Let me go, Tyler. You\u0027re hurting me!\" Panic flashed down all Meredith\u0027s nerves at the feel of Tyler\u0027s flesh against hers. But the hand only gripped harder, grinding tendon against bone in her wrist.\\n\\n \"This is a secret, baby, that nobody else knows,\" Tyler said, pulling her close, his breath hot in her face. \"You came here all decked out against vampires. But I\u0027m not a vampire.\"\\n\\n Meredith\u0027s heart was pounding. \"Let go!\"\\n\\n \"First I want you to look over there. You can see the headstone now,\" he said, turning her so that she couldn\u0027t help but look. And he was right; she could see it, like a red monument with a shining globe on top. Or-not a globe. That marble ball looked like... it looked like...\\n\\n \"Now look east. What do you see there, Meredith?\" Tyler went on, his voice hoarse with excitement.\\n\\n It was the full moon. It had risen while he\u0027d been talking to her, and now it hung above the hills, perfectly round and enormously distended, a huge and swollen red ball.\\n\\n And that was what the headstone looked like. Like a full moon dripping with blood.\\n\\n \"You came here protected against vampires, Meredith,\" Tyler said from behind her, even more hoarsely. \"But the Smallwoods aren\u0027t vampires at all. We\u0027re something else.\"\\n\\n And then he growled.\\n\\n No human throat could have made the sound. It wasn\u0027t an imitation of an animal; it was real. A vicious guttural snarl that went up and up, snapping Meredith\u0027s head around to look at him, to stare in disbelief. What she was seeing was so horrible her mind couldn\u0027t accept it...\\n\\n \"I told you it was a surprise. How do you like it?\" Tyler said. His voice was thick with saliva, and his red tongue lolled among the rows of long canine teeth. His face wasn\u0027t a face anymore. It jutted out grotesquely into a muzzle, and his eyes were yellow, with slitlike pupils. His reddish-sandy hair had grown over his cheeks and down the back of his neck. A pelt. \"You can scream all you want up here and nobody\u0027s going to hear you,\" he added.\\n\\n Every muscle in Meredith\u0027s body was rigid, trying to get away from him. It was a visceral reaction, one she couldn\u0027t have helped if she wanted to. His breath was so hot, and it smelled feral, like an animal. The nails he was digging into her wrist were stumpy blackened claws. She didn\u0027t have the strength to scream again.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s other things besides vampires with a taste for blood,\" Tyler said in his new slurping voice. \"And I want to taste yours. But first we\u0027re going to have some fun.\"\\n\\n Although he still stood on two feet, his body was humped and strangely distorted. Meredith\u0027s struggles were feeble as he forced her to the ground. She was a strong girl, but he was far stronger, his muscles bunching under his shirt as he pinned her.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve always been too good for me, haven\u0027t you? Well, now you\u0027re going to find out what you\u0027ve been missing.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t breathe, Meredith thought wildly. His arm was across her throat, blocking her air. Gray waves rolled through her brain. If she passed out now...\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to wish you died as fast as Sue.\" Tyler\u0027s face floated above her, red as the moon, with that long tongue lolling. His other hand held her arms above her head. \"You ever hear the story of Little Red Riding Hood?\"\\n\\n The gray was turning into blackness, speckled with little lights. Like stars, Meredith thought. I\u0027m falling in the stars...\\n\\n \"Tyler, take your hands off her! Let go of her, now!\" Matt\u0027s voice shouted.\\n\\n Tyler\u0027s slavering snarl broke off into a surprised whine. The arm against Meredith\u0027s throat released pressure, and air rushed into her lungs.\\n\\n Footsteps were pounding around her. \"I\u0027ve been waiting a long time to do this, Tyler,\" Matt said, jerking the sandy-red head back by the hair. Then Matt\u0027s fist smashed into Tyler\u0027s newly grown muzzle. Blood spurted from the wet animal nose.\\n\\n The sound Tyler made froze Meredith\u0027s heart in her chest. He sprang at Matt, twisting in midair, claws outstretched. Matt fell back under the assault and Meredith, dizzy, tried to push herself up off the ground. She couldn\u0027t; all her muscles were trembling uncontrollably. But someone else picked Tyler off Matt as if Tyler weighed no more than a doll.\\n\\n \"Just like old times, Tyler,\" Stefan said, setting Tyler on his feet and facing him.\\n\\n Tyler stared a minute, then tried to run.\\n\\n He was fast, dodging with animal agility between the rows of graves. But Stefan was faster and cut him off.\\n\\n Stefan was dragging Tyler back. \"I always knew you were a jerk,\" he said, shoving Tyler against a headstone, \"but I didn\u0027t know you were this stupid. I\u0027d have thought you would have learned not to jump girls in graveyards, but no. And you had to brag about what you did to Sue, too. That wasn\u0027t smart, Tyler.\"\\n\\n Meredith looked at them as they faced each other. So different, she thought. Even though they were both creatures of darkness in some way. Stefan was pale, his green eyes blazing with anger and menace, but there was a dignity, almost a purity about him. He was like some stern angel carved in unyielding marble. Tyler just looked like a trapped animal. He was crouched, breathing hard, blood and saliva mingling on his chest. Those yellow eyes glittered with hate and fear, and his fingers worked as if he\u0027d like to claw something. A low sound came out of his throat.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, I\u0027m not going to beat you up this time,\" Stefan said. \"Not unless you try to get away. We\u0027re all going up to the church to have a little chat. You like to tell stories, Tyler; well, you\u0027re going to tell me one now.\"\\n\\n Tyler sprang at him, vaulting straight from the ground for Stefan\u0027s throat. But Stefan was ready for him. Meredith suspected that both Stefan and Matt enjoyed the next few minutes, working off their accumulated aggressions, but she didn\u0027t, so she looked away.\\n\\n In the end, Tyler was trussed up with nylon cord. He could walk, or shuffle at least, and Stefan held the back of his shirt and guided him urgently up the path to the church.\\n\\n Inside, Stefan pushed Tyler onto the ground near the open tomb. \"Now,\" he said, \"we are going to talk. And you\u0027re going to cooperate, Tyler, or you\u0027re going to be\\n\\n very, very sorry.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-9.html","bookId":2034,"book":{"id":2034,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: As a psychic, Bonnie has dreams of Elena in the Other World.
