I was hoping he\u0027d give some more information, especially after he admitted to being there when Sue died. But I shouldn\u0027t have waited.\" \"I haven\u0027t admitted anything! You can\u0027t prove anything,\" Tyler said. The animal whine was back in his voice, but on the walk up his face and body had returned to normal. Or rather, they\u0027d returned to human, Meredith thought. The swelling and bruises and dried blood weren\u0027t normal. \"This isn\u0027t a court of law, Tyler,\" she said. \"Your father can\u0027t help you now.\" \"But if it were, we\u0027d have a pretty good case,\" Stefan added. \"Enough to put you away on conspiracy to commit murder, I think.\" \"That\u0027s if somebody doesn\u0027t melt down their grandma\u0027s teaspoons to make a silver bullet,\" Matt put in. Tyler looked from one to another of them. \"I won\u0027t tell you anything.\" \"Tyler, you know what you are? You\u0027re a bully,\" Bonnie said. \"And bullies always talk.\" \"You don\u0027t mind pinning a girl down and threatening her,\" said Matt, \"but when her friends turn up, you\u0027re scared spitless.\" Tyler just glared at all of them. \"Well, if you don\u0027t want to talk, I guess I\u0027ll have to,\" Stefan said. He leaned down and picked up the thick book he\u0027d gotten from the library. One foot on the lip of the tomb, he rested the book on his knee and opened it. In that moment, Meredith thought, he looked frighteningly like Damon. \"This is a book by Gervase of Tilbury, Tyler,\" he said. \"It was written around the year 1210 a.d. One of the things it talks about is werewolves.\" \"You can\u0027t prove anything! You don\u0027t have any evidence-\" \"Shut up, Tyler!\" Stefan looked at him. \"I don\u0027t need to prove it. I can see it, even now. Have you forgotten what I am?\" There was a silence, and then Stefan went on. \"When I got here a few days ago, there was a mystery. A girl was dead. But who killed her? And why? All the clues I could see seemed contradictory. \"It wasn\u0027t an ordinary killing, not some human psycho off the street. I had the word of somebody I trusted on that-and independent evidence, too. An ordinary killer can\u0027t work a Ouija board by telekinesis. An ordinary killer can\u0027t cause fuses to blow in a power plant hundreds of miles away. \"No, this was somebody with tremendous physical and psychic power. From everything Vickie told me, it sounded like a vampire. \"And there was another thing. You were in that house, Tyler. You made the mistake of grabbing Bonnie that night, and then you made the mistake of shooting off your mouth the next day, saying things you couldn\u0027t have known unless you were there. \"So what did we have? A seasoned vampire, a vicious killer with Power to spare? Or a high school bully who couldn\u0027t organize a trip to the toilet without falling over his own feet? Which? The evidence pointed both ways, and I couldn\u0027t make up my mind. \"Then I went to see Sue\u0027s body myself. And there it was, the biggest mystery of all. A cut here.\" Stefan\u0027s finger sketched a sharp line down from his collarbone. \"Typical, traditional cut-made by vampires to share their own blood. But Sue wasn\u0027t a vampire, and she didn\u0027t make that cut herself. Someone made it for her as she lay there dying on the ground.\" Meredith shut her eyes, and she heard Bonnie swallow hard beside her. She put out a hand and found Bonnie\u0027s and held tight, but she went on listening. Stefan had not gone into this kind of detail in his explanation to them before. \"Vampires don\u0027t need to cut their victims like that; they use their teeth,\" Stefan said. His upper lip lifted slightly to show his own teeth. \"But if a vampire wanted to draw blood for somebody else to drink, he might cut instead of biting. If a vampire wanted to give someone else the first and only taste, he might do that. \"And that started me thinking about blood. Blood is important, you see. For vampires, it gives life, Power. It\u0027s all we need for survival, and there are times when needing it drives us crazy. But it\u0027s good for other things, too. For instance... initiation. \"Initiation and Power. Now I was thinking about those two things, putting them together with what I\u0027d seen of you, Tyler, when I was in Fell\u0027s Church before. Little things I hadn\u0027t really focused on. But I remembered something Elena had told me about your family history, and I decided to check it out in Honoria Fell\u0027s journal.\" Stefan lifted a piece of paper from between the pages of the book he held. \"And there it was, in Honoria\u0027s handwriting. I Xeroxed the page so I could read it to you. The Smallwoods\u0027 little family secret-if you can read between the lines.\" Looking down at the paper, he read: \"November 12. Candles made, flax spun. We are short on cornmeal and salt, but we will get through the winter. Last night an alarm; wolves attacked Jacob Smallwood as he returned from the forest. I treated the wound with whortleberry and sallow bark, but it is deep and I am afraid. After coming home I cast the runes. I have told no one but Thomas the results. \"December 20. Wolf trouble at the Smallwoods\u0027 again. We heard the screams a few minutes ago, and Thomas said it was time. He made the bullets yesterday. He has loaded his rifle and we will walk over. If we are spared, I will write again. \"December 21. Went over to Smallwoods\u0027 last night. Jacob sorely afflicted. Wolf killed. \"We will bury Jacob in the little graveyard at the foot of the hill. May his soul find peace in death. \"In the official history of Fell\u0027s Church,\" Stefan said, \"that\u0027s been interpreted to mean that Thomas Fell and his wife went over to the Smallwoods\u0027 to find Jacob Smallwood being attacked by a wolf again, and that the wolf killed him. But that\u0027s wrong. What it really says is not that the wolf killed Jacob Smallwood but that Jacob Smallwood, the wolf, was killed.\" Stefan shut the book. \"He was a werewolf, your great-great-great-whatever grandfather, Tyler. He got that way by being attacked by a werewolf himself. And he passed his werewolf virus on to the son who was born eight and a half months after he died. Just the way your father passed it on to you.\" \"I always knew there was something about you, Tyler,\" Bonnie said, and Meredith opened her eyes. \"I never could tell what it was, but at the back of my mind something was telling me you were creepy.\" \"We used to make jokes about it,\" Meredith said, her voice still husky. \"About your \u0027animal magnetism and your big white teeth. We just never knew how close to the mark we were.\" \"Sometimes psychics can sense that kind of thing,\" Stefan conceded. \"Sometimes even ordinary people can. I should have seen it, but I was preoccupied. Still, that\u0027s no excuse. And obviously somebody else-the psychic killer-saw it right away. Didn\u0027t he, Tyler? A man wearing an old raincoat came to you. He was tall, with blond hair and blue eyes, and he made some kind of a deal with you. In exchange for-something-he\u0027d show you how to reclaim your heritage. How to become a real werewolf. \"Because according to Gervase of Tilbury\"-Stefan tapped the book on his knee -\"a werewolf who hasn\u0027t been bitten himself needs to be initiated. That means you can have the werewolf virus all your life but never even know it because it\u0027s never activated. Generations of Smallwoods have lived and died, but the virus was dormant in them because they didn\u0027t know the secret of waking it up. But the man in the raincoat knew. He knew that you have to kill and taste fresh blood. After that, at the first full moon you can change.\" Stefan glanced up, and Meredith followed his gaze to the white disk of the moon in the sky. It looked clean and two dimensional now, no longer a sullen red globe. \"Very clever,\" said Meredith, and Matt said, \"No kidding.\" Bonnie wet her finger and marked an imaginary 1 on an invisible Scoreboard. \"I knew you wouldn\u0027t be able to resist following one of the girls here if you thought she\u0027d be alone,\" said Stefan. \"You\u0027d think that the graveyard was the perfect place to kill; you\u0027d have complete privacy. And I knew you wouldn\u0027t be able to resist bragging about what you\u0027d done. I was hoping you\u0027d tell Meredith more about the other killer, the one who actually threw Sue out the window, the one who cut her so you could drink fresh blood. The vampire, Tyler. Who is he? Where is he hiding?\" Tyler\u0027s look of venomous hatred changed to a sneer. \"You think I\u0027d tell you that? He\u0027s my friend.\" \"He is not your friend, Tyler. He\u0027s using you. And he\u0027s a murderer.\" \"Don\u0027t get in any deeper, Tyler,\" Matt added. \"You\u0027re already an accessory. Tonight you tried to kill Meredith. Pretty soon you\u0027re not going to be able to go back even if you want to. Be smart and stop this now. Tell us what you know.\" Tyler bared his teeth. \"I\u0027m not telling you anything. How\u0027re you going to make me?\" The others exchanged glances. The atmosphere changed, became charged with tension as they all turned back to Tyler. \"You really don\u0027t understand, do you?\" Meredith said quietly. \"Tyler, you helped kill Sue. She died for an obscene ritual so that you could change into that thing I saw. You were planning to kill me, and Vickie and Bonnie too, I\u0027m sure. Do you think we have any pity for you? Do you think we brought you up here to be nice to you?\" There was a silence. The sneer was fading from Tyler\u0027s lips. He looked from one face to another. They were all implacable. Even Bonnie\u0027s small face was unforgiving. \"Gervase of Tilbury mentions one interesting thing,\" Stefan said, almost pleasantly. \"There\u0027s a cure for werewolves besides the traditional silver bullet. Listen.\" By moonlight, he read from the book on his knee. \"It is commonly reported and held by grave and worthy doctors that if a werewolf be shorn of one of his members, he shall surely recover his original body. Gervase goes on to tell the story of Raimbaud of Auvergne, a werewolf who was cured when a carpenter cut off one of his hind paws. Of course, that was probably hideously painful, but the story goes that Raimbaud thanked the carpenter \u0027for ridding him forever of the accursed and damnable form.\u0027 \" Stefan raised his head. \"Now, I\u0027m thinking that if Tyler won\u0027t help us with information, the least we can do is make sure he doesn\u0027t go out and kill again. What do the rest of you say?\" \"All we have to do is relieve him of one of his members,\" Bonnie agreed. \"I can think of one right off,\" Meredith said under her breath. Tyler\u0027s eyes were starting to bulge. Under the dirt and blood his normally ruddy face had gone pale. \"You\u0027re bluffing!\" \"Get the ax, Matt,\" said Stefan. \"Meredith, you take off one of his shoes.\" Tyler kicked when she did, aiming for her face. Matt came and got his head in a hammer-lock. \"Don\u0027t make it any worse on yourself, Tyler.\" The bare foot Meredith exposed was big, the sole as sweaty as Tyler\u0027s palms. Coarse hair sprouted from the toes. It made Meredith\u0027s skin crawl. \"Let\u0027s get this over with,\" she said. \"You\u0027re joking!\" Tyler howled, thrashing so that Bonnie had to come and grab his other leg and kneel on it. \"You can\u0027t do this! You can\u0027t!\" \"Keep him still,\" Stefan said. Working together, they stretched Tyler out, his head locked in Matt\u0027s arm, his legs spread and pinned by the girls. Making sure Tyler could see what he was doing, Stefan balanced a branch perhaps two inches thick on the lip of the tomb. He raised the ax and then brought it down hard, severing the stick with one blow. \"It\u0027s sharp enough,\" he said. \"Meredith, roll his pants leg up. Then tie some of that cord just above his ankle as tight as you can for a tourniquet. Otherwise he\u0027ll bleed out.\" \"You can\u0027t do this!\" Tyler was screaming. \"You can\u0027t dooooooo this!\" \"Scream all you want, Tyler. Up here, nobody\u0027s going to hear you, right?\" Stefan said. \"You\u0027re no better than I am!\" Tyler yelled in a spray of spittle. \"You\u0027re a killer too!\" \"I know exactly what I am,\" Stefan said. \"Believe me, Tyler. I know. Is everybody ready? Good. Hold on to him; he\u0027s going to jump when I do it.\" Tyler\u0027s screams weren\u0027t even words anymore. Matt was holding him so that he could see Stefan kneel and take aim, hefting the ax blade above Tyler\u0027s ankle to gauge force and distance. \"Now,\" said Stefan, raising the ax high. \"No! No! I\u0027ll talk to you! I\u0027ll talk!\" shrieked Tyler. Stefan glanced at him. \"Too late,\" he said, and brought the ax down. It rebounded off the stone floor with a clang and a spark, but the noise was drowned by Tyler\u0027s screaming. It seemed to take Tyler several minutes to realize that the blade hadn\u0027t touched his foot. He paused for breath only when he choked, and turned wild, bulging eyes on Stefan. Little whimpers were coming from Tyler\u0027s throat and there was foam on his lips. \"I don\u0027t know his name,\" he gasped out. \"But he looks like you said. And you\u0027re right; he\u0027s a vampire, man! I saw him drain a ten-point buck while it was still kicking. He lied to me,\" Tyler added, the whine creeping back into his voice. \"He told me I\u0027d be stronger than anybody, as strong as him. He said I could have any girl I wanted, any way I wanted. The creep lied.\" \"He told you that you could kill and get away with it,\" Stefan said. \"He said I could do Caroline that night. She had it coming after the way she ditched me. I wanted to make her beg-but she got out of the house somehow. I could have Caroline and Vickie, he said. All he wanted was Bonnie and Meredith.\" \"But you just tried to kill Meredith.\" \"That was now. Things are different now, stupid. He said it was all right.\" \"Why?\" Meredith asked Stefan in an undertone. \"Maybe because you\u0027d served your purpose,\" he said. \"You\u0027d brought me here.\" Then he went on, \"All right, Tyler, show us you\u0027re cooperating. Tell us how we can get this guy.\" \"Get him? You\u0027re nuts!\" Tyler burst into ugly laughter, and Matt tightened the arm around his throat. \"Hey, choke me all you want; it\u0027s still the truth. He told me he\u0027s one of the Old Ones, one of the Originals, whatever that means. He said he\u0027s been making vampires since before the pyramids. He said he\u0027s made a bargain with the devil. You could stick a stake in his heart and it wouldn\u0027t do anything. You can\u0027t kill him.\" The laughter became uncontrolled. \"Where\u0027s he hiding, Tyler?\" Stefan rapped out. \"Every vampire needs a place to sleep. Where is it?\" \"He\u0027d kill me if I told you that. He\u0027d eat me, man. God, if I told you what he did to that buck before it died...\" Tyler\u0027s laughter was turning into something like sobs. \"Then you\u0027d better help us destroy him before he can find you, hadn\u0027t you? What\u0027s his weak point? How\u0027s he vulnerable?\" \"God, that poor buck...\" Tyler was blubbering. \"What about Sue? Did you cry over her?\" Stefan said sharply. He picked up the ax. \"I think,\" he said, \"that you\u0027re wasting our time.\" The ax lifted. \"No! No! I\u0027ll talk to you; I\u0027ll tell you something. Look, there\u0027s one kind of wood that can hurt him-not kill him, but hurt him. He admitted that but didn\u0027t tell me what it was! I swear to you that\u0027s the truth!\" \"Not good enough, Tyler,\" said Stefan. \"For God\u0027s sake-I\u0027ll tell you where he\u0027s going tonight. If you get over there fast enough, maybe you can stop him.\" \"What do you mean, where he\u0027s going tonight? Talk fast, Tyler!\" \"He\u0027s going to Vickie\u0027s, okay? He said tonight we get one each. That\u0027s helpful, isn\u0027t it? If you hurry, maybe you can get there!\" Stefan had frozen, and Meredith felt her heart racing. Vickie. They hadn\u0027t even thought about an attack on Vickie. \"Damon\u0027s guarding her,\" Matt said. \"Right, Stefan? Right?\" \"He\u0027s supposed to be,\" Stefan said. \"I left him there at dusk. If something happened, he should have called me...\" \"You guys,\" Bonnie whispered. Her eyes were big and her lips were trembling. \"I think we\u0027d better get over there now.\" They stared at her a moment and then everyone was moving. The ax clanged on the floor as Stefan dropped it. \"Hey, you can\u0027t leave me like this! I can\u0027t drive! He\u0027s gonna come back for me! Come back and untie my hands!\" Tyler shrieked. None of them answered. They ran all the way down the hill and piled into Meredith\u0027s car. Meredith took off speeding, rounding corners dangerously fast and gliding through stop signs, but there was a part of her that didn\u0027t want to get to Vickie\u0027s house. That wanted to turn around and drive the other way. I\u0027m calm; I\u0027m the one who\u0027s always calm, she thought. But that was on the outside. Meredith knew very well how calm you could look on the outside when inside everything was breaking up. They rounded the last corner onto Birch Street and Meredith hit the brakes. \"Oh, God!\" Bonnie cried from the backseat. \"No! No!\" \"Quick,\" Stefan said. \"There may still be a chance.\" He wrenched open the door and was out even before the car had stopped. But in back, Bonnie was sobbing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-10.html","bookId":2034,"book":{"id":2034,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: As a psychic, Bonnie has dreams of Elena in the Other World.
