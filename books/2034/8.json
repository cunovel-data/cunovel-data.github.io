It would have been better to be closer, but then someone might have discovered them.\n Meredith poured the last of the coffee out of the thermos and drank it. Then she yawned. She caught herself guiltily and looked at Bonnie.\n \"You having trouble sleeping at night too?\"\n \"Yes. I can\u0027t imagine why,\" Meredith said.\n \"Do you think the guys are having a little talk?\"\n Meredith glanced at her quickly, obviously surprised, then smiled. Bonnie realized Meredith hadn\u0027t expected her to catch on. \"I hope so,\" Meredith said. \"It might do Matt some good.\"\n Bonnie nodded and relaxed back into the seat. Meredith\u0027s car had never seemed so comfortable before.\n When she looked at Meredith again, the dark-haired girl was asleep.\n Oh, great. Terrific. Bonnie stared into the dregs of her coffee mug, making a face. She didn\u0027t dare relax again; if they both fell asleep, it could be disastrous. She dug her nails into her palms and stared at Vickie\u0027s lighted window.\n When she found the image blurring and doubling on her, she knew something had to be done.\n Fresh air. That would help. Without bothering to be too quiet about it, she unlocked the door and pulled the handle up. The door clicked open, but Meredith went on breathing deeply.\n She must really be tired, Bonnie thought, getting out. She shut the door more gently, locking Meredith inside. It was only then that she realized she herself didn\u0027t have a key.\n Oh, well, she\u0027d wake Meredith to let her back in. Meanwhile she\u0027d go check on Vickie. Vickie was probably still awake.\n The sky was brooding and overcast, but the night was warm. Behind Vickie\u0027s house the black walnut trees stirred very faintly. Crickets sang, but their monotonous chirping only seemed like part of a larger silence.\n The scent of honeysuckle filled Bonnie\u0027s nostrils. She tapped on Vickie\u0027s window lightly with her fingernails, peering through the crack in the curtains.\n No answer. On the bed she could make out a lump of blankets with unkempt brown hair sticking out the top. Vickie was asleep too.\n As Bonnie stood there, the silence seemed to thicken around her. The crickets weren\u0027t singing anymore, and the trees were still. And yet it was as if she was straining to hear something she knew was there.\n None of her ordinary senses told her this. But her sixth sense, the one that sent chills up her arms and ice down her spine, the one that was newly awakened to the presence of Power, was certain. There was... something... near. Something... watching her.\n She turned slowly, afraid to make a sound. If she didn\u0027t make any noise, maybe whatever it was wouldn\u0027t get her. Maybe it wouldn\u0027t notice her.\n The silence had become deadly, menacing. It hummed in her ears with the beat of her own blood. And she couldn\u0027t help imagining what might come screaming out of it at any minute.\n Something with hot, moist hands, she thought, staring into the darkness of the backyard. Black on gray, black on black was all she could see. Every shape might be anything, and all the shadows seemed to be moving. Something with hot, sweaty hands and arms strong enough to crush her-\n The snap of a twig exploded through her like gunfire.\n She spun toward it, eyes and ears straining. But there was only darkness and silence.\n Fingers touched the back of her neck.\n Bonnie whirled again, almost falling, almost fainting. She was too frightened to scream. When she saw who it was, shock robbed all her senses and her muscles collapsed. She would have ended up in a heap on the ground if he hadn\u0027t caught her and held her straight.\n \"You look frightened,\" Damon said softly.\n Bonnie shook her head. She didn\u0027t have any voice yet. She thought she still might faint. But she tried to pull away just the same.\n He didn\u0027t tighten his grip, but he didn\u0027t let go. And struggling did about as much good as trying to break a brick wall with bare hands. She gave up and tried to calm her breathing.\n \"Are you frightened of me?\" Damon said. He smiled reprovingly, as if they shared a secret. \"You don\u0027t need to be.\"\n How had Elena managed to deal with this? But Elena hadn\u0027t, of course, Bonnie realized.\n Elena had succumbed to Damon in the end. Damon had won and had his way.\n He released one of her arms to trace, very lightly, the curve of her upper lip. \"I suppose I should go away,\" he said, \"and not scare you anymore. Is that what you want?\"\n Like a rabbit with a snake, Bonnie thought. This is how the rabbit feels. Only I don\u0027t suppose he\u0027ll kill me. I might just die on my own, though. She felt as if her legs might melt away at any minute, as if she might collapse. There was a warmth and a trembling inside her.\n Elena wouldn\u0027t like it, she thought, just as his lips touched hers. Yes, that was it. But the problem was, she didn\u0027t have the strength to say it. The warmth was growing, rushing out to all parts of her, from her fingertips to the soles of her feet. His lips were cool, like silk, but everything else was so warm. She didn\u0027t need to be afraid; she could just let go and float on this. Sweetness rushed through her...\n \"What the hell is going on?\"\n The voice broke the silence, broke the spell. Bonnie started and found herself able to turn her head. Matt was standing at the edge of the yard, his fists clenched, his eyes like chips of blue ice. Ice so cold it burned.\n \"Get away from her,\" Matt said.\n To Bonnie\u0027s surprise, the grip on her arms eased. She stepped back, straightening her blouse, a little breathless. Her mind was working again.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" she said to Matt, her voice almost normal. \"I was just-\"\n \"Go back to the car and stay there.\"\n Now wait a minute, thought Bonnie. She was glad Matt had come; the interruption had been very conveniently timed. But he was coming on a little heavy with the protective older brother bit.\n \"Look, Matt-\"\n \"Go on,\" he said, still staring at Damon.\n Meredith wouldn\u0027t have let herself be ordered around this way. And Elena certainly wouldn\u0027t. Bonnie opened her mouth to tell Matt to go sit in the car himself when she suddenly realized something.\n This was the first time in months she\u0027d seen Matt really care about anything. The light was back in those blue eyes-that cold flash of righteous anger that used to make even Tyler Smallwood back down. Matt was alive right now, and full of energy. He was himself again.\n Bonnie bit her lip. For a moment she struggled with her pride. Then she conquered it and lowered her eyes.\n \"Thanks for rescuing me,\" she murmured, and left the yard.\n Matt was so angry he didn\u0027t dare move closer to Damon for fear he might take a swing at him. And the chilling darkness in Damon\u0027s eyes told him that wouldn\u0027t be a very good idea.\n But Damon\u0027s voice was smooth, almost dispassionate. \"My taste for blood isn\u0027t just a whim, you know. It\u0027s a necessity you\u0027re interfering with here. I\u0027m only doing\n what I have to.\"\n Contemptuously he said, \"Why don\u0027t you pick on somebody your own size, then?\"\n Damon smiled and the air went colder. \"Like you?\"\n Matt just stared at him. He could feel muscles clench in his jaw. After a moment he said tightly, \"You can try.\"\n \"I can do more than try, Matt.\" Damon took a single step toward him like a stalking panther. Involuntarily, Matt thought of jungle cats, of their powerful spring and their sharp, tearing teeth. He thought of what Tyler had looked like in the Quonset hut last year when Stefan was through with him. Red meat. Just red meat and blood.\n \"What was that history teacher\u0027s name?\" Damon was saying silkily. He seemed amused now, enjoying this. \"Mr. Tanner, wasn\u0027t it? I did more than try with him.\"\n \"You\u0027re a murderer.\"\n Damon nodded, unoffended, as if he\u0027d just been introduced. \"Of course, he stuck a knife in me. I wasn\u0027t planning to drain him quite dry, but he annoyed me and I changed my mind. You\u0027re annoying me now, Matt.\"\n Matt had his knees locked to keep from running. It was more than the catlike stalking grace, it was more than those unearthly black eyes fastened on his. There was something inside Damon that whispered terror to the human brain. Some menace that spoke directly to Matt\u0027s blood, telling him to do anything to get away.\n But he wouldn\u0027t run. His conversation with Stefan was blurred in his mind right now, but he knew one thing from it. Even if he died here, he wouldn\u0027t run.\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\" Damon said, as if he\u0027d heard every word of Matt\u0027s thoughts. \"You\u0027ve never had blood taken from you by force, have you? It hurts, Matt. It hurts a lot.\"\n Elena, Matt remembered. That first time when she\u0027d taken his blood he\u0027d been scared, and the fear had been bad enough. But he\u0027d been doing it of his own volition then. What would it be like when he was unwilling?\n I will not run. I will not look away.\n Aloud he said, still looking straight at Damon, \"If you\u0027re going to kill me, you\u0027d better stop talking and do it. Because maybe you can make me die, but that\u0027s all you can make me do.\"\n \"You\u0027re even stupider than my brother,\" Damon said. With two steps he crossed the distance to Matt. He grabbed Matt by his T-shirt, one hand on either side of the throat. \"I guess I\u0027ll have to teach you the same way.\"\n Everything was frozen. Matt could smell his own fear, but he wouldn\u0027t move. He couldn\u0027t move now.\n Damon\u0027s teeth were a white glitter in the dark. Sharp as carving knives. Matt could almost feel the razor bite of them before they touched him.\n I will not surrender anything, he thought, and closed his eyes.\n The shove took him completely off balance. He stumbled and fell backward, his eyes flying open. Damon had let go and pushed him away.\n Expressionless, those black eyes looked down at him where he sat in the dirt. \"I\u0027ll try to put this in a way you can understand,\" Damon said. \"You don\u0027t want to\n mess with me, Matt. I am more dangerous than you can possibly imagine. Now get out of here. It\u0027s my watch.\"\n Silently, Matt got up. He rubbed at his shirt where Damon\u0027s hands had crumpled it. And then he left, but he didn\u0027t run and he didn\u0027t flinch from Damon\u0027s eyes.\n I won, he thought. I\u0027m still alive, so I won.\n And there had been a kind of grim respect in those black eyes in the end. It made Matt wonder about some things. It really did.\n Bonnie and Meredith were sitting in the car when he got back. They both looked concerned.\n \"You were gone a long time,\" Bonnie said. \"Are you okay?\"\n Matt wished people would stop asking him that. \"I\u0027m fine,\" he said, and then added, \"Really.\" After a moment\u0027s thought he decided there was something else he should say. \"Sorry if I yelled at you back there, Bonnie.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" Bonnie said coolly. Then, thawing, she said, \"You really do look better, you know. More like your old self.\"\n \"Yeah?\" He rubbed at his crumpled T-shirt again, looking around. \"Well, tangling with vampires is obviously a great warm-up exercise.\"\n \"What\u0027d you guys do? Lower your heads and run at each other from opposite sides of the yard?\" asked Meredith.\n \"Something like that. He says he\u0027s going to watch Vickie now.\"\n \"Do you think we can trust him?\" Meredith said soberly.\n Matt considered. \"As a matter of fact, I do. It\u0027s weird, but I don\u0027t think he\u0027s going to hurt her. And if the killer comes along, I think he\u0027s in for a surprise. Damon\u0027s spoiling for a fight. We might as well go back to the library for Stefan.\"\n Stefan wasn\u0027t visible outside the library, but when the car had cruised up and down the street once or twice he materialized out of the darkness. He had a thick book with him.\n \"Breaking and entering and grand theft, library book,\" Meredith remarked. \"I wonder what you get for that these days?\"\n \"You mean you found it? You figured it out? Then you can tell us everything, like you promised,\" Bonnie said. \"Let\u0027s go to the boarding house.\"\n Stefan looked slightly surprised when he heard that Damon had turned up and stationed himself at Vickie\u0027s, but he made no comment. Matt didn\u0027t tell him exactly how Damon had turned up, and he noticed Bonnie didn\u0027t either.\n \"I\u0027m almost positive about what\u0027s going on in Fell\u0027s Church. And I\u0027ve got half the puzzle solved, anyway,\" Stefan said once they were all settled in his room in the boarding house attic. \"But there\u0027s only one way to prove it, and only one way to solve the other half. I need help, but it isn\u0027t something I\u0027m going to ask lightly.\" He was looking at Bonnie and Meredith as he said it.\n They looked at each other, then back at him. \"This guy killed one of our friends,\" said Meredith. \"And he\u0027s driving another one crazy. If you need our help, you\u0027ve got it.\"\n \"Whatever it takes,\" Bonnie added.\n \"It\u0027s something dangerous, isn\u0027t it?\" Matt demanded. He couldn\u0027t restrain himself. As if Bonnie hadn\u0027t been through enough...\n \"It\u0027s dangerous, yes. But it\u0027s their fight too, you know.\"\n \"Darn right it is,\" said Bonnie. Meredith was obviously trying to repress a smile. Finally she had to turn away and grin.\n \"Matt\u0027s back,\" she said when Stefan asked her what the joke was.\n \"We missed you,\" added Bonnie. Matt couldn\u0027t understand why they were all smiling at him, and it made him feel hot and uncomfortable. He went over to stand by the window.\n \"It is dangerous; I won\u0027t try to kid you about that,\" Stefan said to the girls. \"But it\u0027s the only chance. The whole thing\u0027s a little complicated, and I\u0027d better start at the beginning. We have to go back to the founding of Fell\u0027s Church...\"\n He talked on late into the night.\n Thursday, June 11, 7:00 a.m.\n Dear Diary,\n I couldn\u0027t write last night, because I got in too late. Mom was upset again. She\u0027d have been hysterical if she\u0027d known what I was actually doing. Hanging out with vampires and planning something that may get me killed. That may get us all killed.\n Stefan has a plan to trap the guy who murdered Sue. It reminds me of some of Elena\u0027s plans-and that\u0027s what worries me. They always sounded wonderful, but\n lots of the time they went wrong.\n Anyway, we\u0027re going to do it after graduation. We\u0027re all in on it except Damon, who\u0027ll be watching Vickie. It\u0027s strange, but we all trust him now. Even me. Despite what he did to me last night, I don\u0027t think he\u0027ll let Vickie get hurt.\n I haven\u0027t had any more dreams about Elena. I think if I do, I will go absolutely screaming berserk. Or never go to sleep again. I just can\u0027t take any more of that.\n All right. I\u0027d better go. Hopefully, by Sunday we\u0027ll have the mystery solved and die killer caught. I trust Stefan.\n I just hope I can remember my part. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-dark-reunion-the-vampire-diaries-4/page-8.html","bookId":2034,"book":{"id":2034,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: Dark Reunion (The Vampire Diaries #4)","description":"Storyline: \n As a psychic, Bonnie has dreams of Elena in the Other World.
