{"id":1903,"title":"Afterlife (Knights of the Board Room #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Afterlife (Knights of the Board Room #4) \n Part of the Knights of the Board Room series. Rachel gave up seeking a Master years ago. After a failed marriage and terrible tragedy, she\u0027s walled her soul against going down that dangerous path again. Then Jon joins her yoga class. He\u0027s thirteen years younger than she, but his Dominant nature threatens her shields from the moment she recognizes it. Not only does he understand what her body wants-he knows what her soul craves. Part of the five-man executive team of Kensington \u0026 Associates, Jon uses his calm, philosophical nature to defuse volatile acquisition negotiations. He can compel opponents to willingly surrender when he draws the sword that closes the deal. As a sexual Dominant, he employs that same expertise. A spiritually driven Master who enjoys connecting with a woman\u0027s soul, he wins her utter submission with his skills. But with Rachel, it goes beyond that. She\u0027s the submissive his own soul has always hungered to have, and he won\u0027t hesitate to use his talents, as well as that of the other four K\u0026A men, to claim her. Publisher\u0027s Note: Rachel\u0027s sensual journey to healing contains light female/female exploration and group sex.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/afterlife-knights-of-the-board-room-4.jpg","author":"Joey W.
