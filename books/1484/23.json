{"id":30682,"no":23,"title":"CHAP. XX.","content":"The Capacity of the Greenlanders, and their Inclination towards the Knowledge of God, and the Christian Religion; and by what Means this may easily be brought about. \\n\\n \\n\\n AS the Greenlanders are naturally very stupid and indolent; so are they likewise very little disposed to comprehend and consider the divine truths which we expound to them; and notwithstanding people in years seem to approve of the Christian doctrine, yet it is with a surprising indifference and coldness. For they can neither comprehend the miserable condition they are in; nor do they rightly understand and value the exceeding great mercy and loving kindness God has shown towards mankind in his dear Son{215} Christ Jesus, so as to move them to any desire and longing after it; some few excepted. This is to me an undeniable evidence that the carnally-minded man cannot comprehend the things that belong to God; for to him they seem to be foolish, and he cannot know them, as the Apostle speaks, 1 Cor. ii. But as they in general are so credulous, that one can make them believe any thing, so they are likewise in this grand affair. They never question what they are taught of God and Christ; but at the same time it never takes any rooting in their mind, because it passes without any consideration and feeling. For which reason they do not contradict or dispute with us the matters proposed; and very few have offered any objections, or desired any difficulty to be explained. And as their behaviour is silly and childish, so we have used the same method in teaching them, as we do to instruct little children; inculcating the Christian truths into their mind by frequent repetitions, and making use of simple and obvious comparisons, which, I thank God Almighty, has not{216} wanted his blessing. For I have perceived in some the working of his grace in a serious amendment of their lives; and their endeavours have been to advance in the way to perfection, though all as yet is but a beginning and infancy, as we have mentioned in the last year’s Memoirs or Relations of Greenland. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is a matter which cannot be questioned, that if you will make a Christian out of a mere savage and wild man, you must first make him a reasonable man, and the next step will be easier. This is authorised and confirmed by our Saviour’s own method. He makes a beginning from the earthly things; he proposes the mysteries of the kingdom of God in parables and similitudes. The first care taken in the conversion of Heathens is to remove out of the way all obstacles which may hinder their conversion, and render them unfit to receive the Christian doctrine, before any thing successfully can be undertaken in their behalf. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would contribute a great deal to forward their conversion, if they could by degrees be{217} brought into a settled way of life, and to abandon this sauntering and wandering about from place to place to seek their livelihood. But this cannot be hoped until a Christian nation comes to be settled among them (I mean in such places where the ground is fit for tillage and pasturage) to teach them, and by little and little accustom them to a quiet and more useful way of life, than that which they now follow. \\n\\n \\n\\n They should also be kept under some discipline, and restrained from their foolish superstitions, and from the silly tricks and wicked impostures of their angekkuts, which ought to be altogether prohibited and punished. Yet my meaning is, not that they, by force and constraint, should be compelled to embrace our religion, but to use gentle methods. Is it not allowed in the church of Christ to make use of Christian discipline at times and seasons, with prudence and due moderation; which is a powerful means to advance the growth of piety and devotion? How much more is it necessary to apply the same means here to grub up an{218} untilled ground, where a new church is to be planted? Else it would be the same imprudence as to throw good seed into thorns and briars, which would choak the seed. \\n\\n \\n\\n But as the chief fruit of our labours and teaching is to be expected from the growing youth, so if some good regulations and small foundations were laid for the bringing up a number of children in the Christian faith and piety, no doubt God would prosper it; inasmuch as these poor children and growing youth are very tractable and teachable, and good natured; showing no inclination or propensity to vice. Neither do they want capacity; for I have found they will take any thing as soon as any of our own children. Now if these gifts or natural talents were forwarded by the gifts of grace, who would question their growth and advancement in the Christian faith and virtues, which would ripen to the full harvest of eternal happiness? Good God! how easy a thing would it be to help these poor wretches out of their misery, if those that God has blessed with{219} wealth were heavenly minded, and would be sensible of the wretched condition of their fellow creatures, and contribute out of their abundance to the founding of a school in these parts, and the providing of other most necessary things! \\n\\n \\n\\n His Majesty, out of his wonted most glorious zeal for the growth and advancement of the church of Christ, has most graciously provided, by a considerable sum of money yearly set apart, for the Greenland Missionaries’ entertainment, which royal bounty continues to this day; for which goodness the most gracious God will bless his Majesty and all the royal hereditary house, and be their reward for ever. But as a good deal of this bounty money must be employed in the promoting of trade (without which the mission could not subsist), but little remains for promoting the proper end of the mission, which is the conversion of the Heathens, in which at present are employed no more than four missionaries, and two catechists, besides some few charity children belonging to both colonies, whose entertainment is to be provided for.{220} Hitherto we have not been able to do great matters, but contented ourselves with some excursions here and there instructing the natives; who likewise, when they have had an opportunity, come to us with their families to be instructed. But as these excursions of ours, and those visits of theirs have not been very frequent, and only for a short time, by reason of the impossibility of travelling at all seasons, which has obliged us to leave them for a while to deal for themselves; it is not to be expected that our pains-taking should have had that success, which would attend it, if there were missionaries settled in different stations amongst them. For in several years we count but between twenty and thirty aged persons, and a hundred and odd young ones, that have been found capable to receive the holy sacrament of baptism. If amongst ourselves we had no schools, nor other pious foundations, for the instruction and Christian education of youth and old people, pray what great feats would one or two teachers in a whole country be able to do, by once or twice a{221} year taking a journey throughout the land, and preaching a passage sermon? The apostles of Christ did not think this method sufficient; but after they had preached the word of God up and down, they besides ordained and constituted teachers and catechists everywhere. And if so wholesome a method be followed in Greenland, who will question a happier success? \\n\\n \\n\\n And this is all I at present have to say of the affairs of Greenland; leaving it to the judgment of others to be made out and decided, whether Greenland is a country that deserves to be improved and taken care of, or no? And whether its inhabitants may be called happy, or no? All things well pondered, both the affirmative and negative may be true, without the least contradiction. For Greenland can pass for no better than a dismal and pitiful country, in regard to the greatest part of it, viz. all the inland country, which is perpetually covered with ice and snow, that never melts, and therefore of no use to mankind; and as to the remaining part, on the sea side, most of it lies uncultivated and unin{222}habited. But here it may again be said, that as to the first part, or the inland country, it is a thing that is past remedy; but as to the last part, or the sea side, it may be put in a better state by settlements, and manuring, so that it may recover its former fertility; and thus it might be reckoned a good and profitable country, provided the formerly inhabited tracks of land were anew settled and peopled. I will forbear to mention the great wealth and richness, which lies hidden in the Greenland seas, and can never be exhausted. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the land I will go to the inhabitants, which every body will think more wretched than happy, considered as destitute of the true knowledge of their Creator; and besides lead but very poor and despicable lives. The knowledge of God is undoubtedly that which affords the greatest happiness to mankind; as the want of it makes one the most wretched of all beings. But who would dare to deny it, if I should find out somebody yet more wretched than they? And such there are who have been blessed with{223} the true knowledge of God; yet do nevertheless refuse him that obedience, which, as our Creator and Master, and in regard of our redemption and a thousand other particular kindnesses, he has the best of titles to demand it upon, according as he requires it of us in his holy Word. If the life of the Greenlanders, which we call poor and despicable, with respect to morality, be compared to that of the most pretended Christians; I am afraid they will confound others on the great Day of Judgment. For though they have no law, yet by the light of nature do some of the works of the law, as the apostle says, Rom. ii. What thoughts will any one harbour, who seriously considers the predominant passions, as greediness after gain, covetousness, unmeasured ambition and pride, sumptuous, voluptuous, and prodigal lives; envy, hatred, and mutual persecutions, and innumerable other vices and crimes of most Christians? Can any one help thinking, but that such evil doers (the remotest from the life, which is God alone) must be deemed the most unhappy{224} of all? Whilst on the other hand, the Greenlanders pass their lives, as I may say, in a natural innocence and simplicity. Their desires do not extend farther than to necessary things; pomp and pride is unknown to them; hatred, envy, and persecution never plagued them; neither do they affect the dominion over one another. In short, every one is contented with his own state and condition, and are not tormented with unnecessary cares. Is not this the greatest happiness of this life? O happy people! what better things can one wish you, than what you already possess? Have you no riches? yet poverty does not trouble you. Have you no superfluity? yet you suffer no want. Is there no pomp and pride to be seen among you? neither is there any slight or scorn to be met with. Is there no nobility or high rank amongst them? neither is there any slavery or bondage. What is sweeter than liberty? And what is happier than contentedness? But one thing is yet wanting: I mean, the saving knowledge of God and his dear son Christ Jesus, in which alone consists eternal life and happiness. John xvii. And this is what we offer you, in preaching to you the holy Gospel. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, God, who bade light shine forth in darkness, enlighten your hearts, in the light of the knowledge of God’s glorious appearance in and through Christ Jesus. May he deliver your souls from the slavery of the Devil, and of sinful lusts, as you are free from corporeal bondage, to the end that you always may be free with the Lord both in soul and body. Amen. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE END. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2684/73921.html","bookId":1484,"book":{"id":1484,"title":"A Description of Greenland","description":"简介： THE regions in the neighbourhood of the North Pole have lately become the objects of increased curiosity; and among these regions Greenland has attracted a more than usual interest.
