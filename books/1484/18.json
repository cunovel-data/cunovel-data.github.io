{"id":30677,"no":18,"title":"CHAP. XV.","content":"Their Pastimes and Diversions, as also their Poetry. THE Greenlanders have several kinds of sports and recreations, with which they pass their time, when they have nothing else to do, or when they visit one another: of which these are the most remarkable. When they meet together for diversion’s sake, the first step made is always banqueting and revelling, where they stuff themselves with all the dainty bits{155} and the best cheer the country affords; as rein deer and seal flesh dried or boiled; and the tail of a whale, which they reckon among the greatest delicacies. Of these things they eat very greedily; for it is a great honour done to the landlord who treats, that his guests, when come home, complain that their belly was too small, and that it was ready to burst. After the repast, they get up to divert themselves in this manner: one of the company takes a drum, which is made of a broad wooden hoop, or of the rib of a whale, covered with a thin skin, with a handle to it; which drum he beats with a stick, singing at the same time songs, either concerning the common affairs in general, or his own private ones in particular. In which, at the end of each verse, the whole chorus of men and women join with him. He that can play the most odd and comical gestures, and play the most ridiculous tricks with his face, head, and limb, turning{156} them awry, passes for the most ingenious fellow; as he by his awkward and out of the way postures can make others laugh. They show their wit chiefly in satirical songs, which they compose against one another; and he, that overcomes his fellow in this way of debate, is admired and applauded by the rest of the assembly. If any body conceives a jealousy, or bears a grudge to another upon any account, he sends to him, and challenges him to a duel in such or such assembly; where he will fight it out with him in taunting ditties. Whereupon the defied, in defence of his honour, prepares his weapons, and does not fail to appear at the time and place appointed, if his courage do not forsake him. When the assembly is met, and the combatants arrived, every body being silent and attentive to hear what end the combat will take, the challenger first enters the lists, and begins to sing, accompanying it with the beat of his drum. The challenged rises also, and in silence listens, until his champion or{157} adversary has done singing. Then he likewise enters the lists, armed with the same weapons, and lays about his party the best he can. And thus they alternately sing as long as their stock of ditties lasts. He that first gives over, is reckoned overcome and conquered. In this sort of taunting ditties they reproach and upbraid one another with their failings. And this is their common way of taking vengeance. There is not to be expected great ingenuity or sallies and points of wit in their poesies, yet there is some cadence and number in their verses, and some kind of rhyme in them. For an instance of which I join hereto a Greenland song, or ode, composed by one of the natives, who formerly lived in our colony, by name Frederick Christian, upon the birth day of his then royal highness, Prince Christian, on the 30th of November, 1729, which is as follows.{158} A G R E E N L A N D S O N G, COMPOSED BY FREDERICK CHRISTIAN, A Native. Amna aja aja, aja aja, \u0026c. [Entry. One morning as I went out, and saw, That flags and colours were flying, And that they made ready To fire the guns; Then I demanded, Why do you fire? And they answered me, because the King’s Son’s Birth day was celebrated, Who is to be king after his father, Annigamma irsigeik, amna aja aja, \u0026c. Arvallirsullitlarmeta: amna aja, \u0026c.

Thereupon I said to my friend, Let us make a song To the King’s Son; For he shall be made king. This my little song shall praise him: ’Tis said, he is a brave prince, Let us therefore rejoice; For he shall be our king, After his Father’s death, We rejoice also, because He loves us as his Father does; Who sent over clergymen to us, To teach us the word of God; Lest we should go to the Devil. Be thou like him, so shall we love thee, Kingoreis semmane; amna aja, \u0026c. Tava ikkinguntiga; amna aja aja, \u0026c. Pitsimik sennegiluk; amna aja, \u0026c.

That thou hast thought on us, This we know very well, O gracious Son of the King. We hope thou wilt continue so to do, The King thy father has before possessed us, When thou shalt be our King thou’lt prove good enough. Whatever we possess Shall be thine altogether. When Greenland shall have received instruction, Then shall they love God and honour the King. Let us be merry, And of the King’s Son Drink the health. And say, Long live Christian!

Would to God our countrymen were also. Nulliello: amna aja aja, aja aja, \u0026c. Okiutikit armarlesorsuangorlutik: amna aja, \u0026c. Friderik Christian ikingutigalo; amna, \u0026c.

They have, besides this, another sort of diversion, accompanied with singing, which consists in swopping or bartering. He that performs the office of drummer and singer, exposes one thing or other to sale, at any rate he thinks fit; if any of the company has a liking to it, he shows his consent by giving the seller a slap on his breech, and the bargain is done, and cannot be retrieved, whether good or bad. The boys and lads have also their pastimes and plays, when they meet in the evening. They take a small piece of wood, with a hole in it at one end, to that they tie a little pointed stick with a thread or string, and{162} throwing the piece with the hole in it up into the air, they strive to catch it upon the pointed stick, through the hole. He that does it twenty times successively, and without failing, gains the match, or party, and he that misses gets a black stroke on his forehead for every time he misses. Another boy’s play is a game of chance, like cards or dice; they have a piece of wood pointed at one end, with a pin or peg in the midst, upon which it turns; when the boys are seated around, and every one laid down what they play for, one of them turns the pointed piece of wood with his finger, that it wheels about like a mariner’s compass; and when it has done, he that the point aims at, wins all that was laid down. Ball playing is their most common diversion, which they play two different ways. They divide themselves into two parties; the first party throws the ball to each other; while those of the second party endeavour to get it from them, and so by turns. The second manner is like our playing at foot ball. They mark out two barriers, at three{163} or four hundred paces distance one from the other; then being divided into two parties, as before, they meet at the starting place, which is at the midway between the two barriers; and the ball being thrown upon the ground, they strive who first shall, get at it, and kick it with the foot, each party towards their barrier. He that is the most nimble footed and dextrous at it, kicking the ball before him, and getting the first to the barrier, has won the match. Thus (they will tell you) the deceased play at foot ball in Heaven, with the head of a morse, when it lightens, or the North-light (aurora borealis) appears, which they fancy to be the souls of the deceased. When their acquaintance from abroad come to see them, they spend whole days and nights in singing and dancing; and as they love to pass for men of courage and valour, they will try forces together, in wrestling, struggling, and playing hook and crook, which is to grapple with the arms and fingers made{164} crooked, and intangled like hooks. Whoever can pull the other from his place, thinks himself a man of worth and valour. The women’s or rather the maiden’s plays, consist in dancing around, holding one another by the hand, forming a circle, and singing of songs.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2684/73916.html","bookId":1484,"book":{"id":1484,"title":"A Description of Greenland","description":"简介： THE regions in the neighbourhood of the North Pole have lately become the objects of increased curiosity; and among these regions Greenland has attracted a more than usual interest.
