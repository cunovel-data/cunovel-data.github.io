{"id":30678,"no":19,"title":"CHAP. XVI.","content":"Of their Language. THOUGH the Greenland language has not affinity with other European tongues, yet it seems to have borrowed some words from the Norwegians, who formerly inhabited part of the land; for such words agree both in name and signification; as, for example, Kona, a Woman; Nerriok, to eat, from the Norway word Noerrie. The herb Angelica, which they in Norway call Quaun, the Greenlanders call Qvaunnek. A Porpoise, in Norway called Nise, they call Nise. Ashes, in Norway, Aske, in Greenland, Arkset. A Lamp, in the Norwegian, Kolle, in the Greenlandian, Kollek. Some of their words resemble Latin words of{166} the same signification; as, Gutta, a drop; in the Greenland tongue, Gutte, or Kutte. Ignis, Fire, they call Ingnek. And some they have got from Hebrew roots, as, Appa, a word the children use to name their father, and some others. The accent and pronunciation of it is hard and difficult, because they speak very thick, and in the throat. The same language is spoke throughout the whole country, though the accent and pronunciation differs here and there as different dialects; chiefly towards the Southern parts, where they have received and adopted many foreign words, not used in the Northern parts. But the angekuts, or divines, make use of a particular speech, whenever they conjure; for then they use metaphorical locutions and words in a contrary sense. The women-kind also have a particular pronunciation peculiar to themselves, and different from that of the men, making use of the softest letters at the end of words, instead of hard ones; for example, Am for Ap, that{167} is, Yes. Saving, for Savik, a Knife. Their language, in common, wants the letters, c, d, f, q, x. They have besides many double and unknown consonants, which is the cause, that many of their words cannot be spelt according to their manner of pronouncing them. For the rest, their expressions are very natural and easy, and their constructions so neat and regular, that one would hardly expect so much from a nation so unpolite and illiterate. The language is very rich of words and sense, and of such energy, that one is often at a loss and puzzled to render it in Danish; but then again it wants words to express such things as are foreign, and not in use among them. They have monosyllables and polysyllables, but most of the last. Their words, as well nouns as verbs, are inflected at the end, by varying the terminations, without the help of the articles or particles, like the Greek and Latin. The adjectives always follow their substantives; but the possessive pronouns are joined to the{168} nouns, as the Hebrew suffixa[35]: nor have the nouns alone their suffixa, but the verbs also. To satisfy the reader’s curiosity, I have hereto joined a list of some of the words and a sketch, showing the construction and inflections of this language. VOCABULARY OF THE LANGUAGE OF GREENLAND.

There are three tenses in all, the present,{171} preterit, and future; and six moods, viz. indicative, interrogative, imperative, permissive, conjunctive, and infinitive. The examples of the simple verbs are these. The first conjugation ends in kpok, as Ermikpok, he washes himself: Aglekpok, he writes. The second ends in rpok, as Mattarpok, he undresses himself: Aularpok, he sets out on a journey: Ajokarsorpok, he teaches. The third conjugation ends in pokpurum; that is, in pok preceded by a vowel, as Egipok, he throws away; Inginok, he sits down; Akpapok, he runs. The fourth ends in ok or vok, as Pyok, he receives: Aglyok, he grows: Assavok, he loves. The fifth conjugation ends in au, as Irsigau, he ogles; Arsigau, he resembles; Angekau, he is tall. The sixth conjugation of negative verbs ends in ngilak, as Ermingilak, he does not wash himself: Mattengilak, he does not undress himself: Pingilak, he receives not: Egingilak, he throws not away: Irsigingilak, he ogles not.{172} Inflexion of a Verb with the suffixes of a person agent of the first conjugation in kpok. Indicative. Present. Singular. Dual Plural. He washes himself, The two wash themselves, They wash themselves, Ermikpok. Ermikpuk. Ermikput. I wash myself, We two wash ourselves, We wash us. Ermikpunga. Ermikpoguk. Ermikpogut. Thou wash thyself, You two wash yourselves, You wash yourselves. Ermikpotit. Ermikpotik. Ermikpose. The inflexion with suffixes of a person patient is formed this way. Thou washest me. Ye two wash me, You wash me, Ermikparma, Ermikpautiga. Ermikpausinga. He washes me, The two wash me, They wash me, Ermikpanga. Ermikpainga. Ermikpanga. I wash him, We two wash him, We wash him, Ermikpara. Ermikparpuk. Ermikparput.

Inflexion of the Negative Verb. He washes not The two wash not They wash not himself, themselves., themselves., Ermingilak. Ermingilek. Ermingilat. I do not wash We two wash not We wash not myself, ourselves, ourselves, {174}Ermingilanga. Ermingilaguk. Ermingilagut. Thou dost not wash Ye two do not wash You do not wash thyself, yourselves, yourselves, Ermingilatit. Ermingilatik. Ermingilase. With the suffixes of the patient person the negative verbs are inflected like the affirmatives; as, He washes me not, Ye two wash me not, They wash me not, Ermingilanga. idem. idem. Thou washest me not, Ye two wash me not, You wash me not, Ermingilarma. Ermingilautinga. Ermingilausinga. And in the same manner you may inflect all verbs whatsoever. The preterits and futures have the same suffixa as the present tense. Concerning the compounded verbs, it is to be observed, that, whereas their auxiliary verbs are but few, they make use of several particles to supply their place, which are annexed to the simple verbs, and so make them compounded verbs, yet these particles by themselves are not used,{175} nor of any signification. And by this connection or composition the simple verbs change their conjugation. As for example, First, in this expression, they used to do so and so, the composition is formed thus; of the simple verb Erminpok, he washes himself, in the composition is made Ermingarace, he uses to wash himself. Kieavok, he weeps; Kieeillarau, he uses to weep; Aularpok, he goes from home; Aulararau, he uses to go from home. Second, when the expression runs thus, he comes to do this or that, it is turned in this manner. Ermigiartorpok, he comes to wash himself; Aglegiartorpok, he comes to write. And so in all other compositions. But there are not only verbs compounded with one, but sometimes with two, three, or more particles joined to the verb, when there is a longer sentence to be expressed. And for this reason, the words and particles undergo a great many changes and variations, inasmuch as they retain but certain radical letters, the rest{176} either being thrown away and quite lost, or else changed for others. As for instance, Aulisariartorasuarpok, he made haste to go out a fishing. Here three verbs are joined together in one. Aulisarpok, he fishes; Peartorpok, to go about something; and Pinnesuarpok, to make haste. Again, Aglekkinniarit, endeavour to write better. Here we have another threefold composition. First, Aglekpok, he writes; then Pekipok, to mend, or do better, and at last Pinniarpok, to endeavour. From whence comes the verb Aglikkinniarpok, he endeavours to write better; in the imperative mood, Aglekkinniarit, as above. The Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer, translated into the Greenland Language.
