{"id":23545,"no":33,"title":"Chapter 32","content":"There were thousands of men flying this way and that, wild-eyed and shrieking. Van Rensselaer caught a phrase here and there,—\"freight rates—ruin them—the van Rensselaers—Shrike.\" And meanwhile he was hurrying on his way to the board-room. He was a member and was admitted to the bedlam, to the edge of that writhing, hysterical mass of men who were crushing each other, breathless in their efforts to reach the trading-post. Van Rensselaer gazed at the figure of the stock—it was 157! He heard the same exclamations here that he had heard outside,—\"freight rates—the van Rensselaers,\"—and all the rest; and then suddenly he saw near him a huge ox of a man, waving a paper in one hand and bellowing in a voice that rang above the whole uproar. It was one of van Rensselaer\u0027s own brokers, the best of them; and as van[119] Rensselaer heard him his heart stood still. The moment had come! \"I offer twenty thousand three-day sellers! T. \u0026 S. twenty thousand!—one fifty-seven! one fifty-seven! Twenty thousand three-day sellers—one fifty-six and seven-eighths! one fifty-six and three-quarters!\" And then again the roar swelled up and drowned him. Men were screaming from a hundred places: \"One thousand at one fifty-six and a half! Thirty-five hundred at one fifty-six! one fifty-six! one fifty-five and a half!\" And van Rensselaer, mad, drunk, and blind with passion, shook his hands in the air and screamed in frenzy, \"Down! down with them! Down! Jump on them! Pound them! Go on! go on!\" He knew now that it was victory; he could feel it in the air—the panic, the wild, raging, mad tornado that uproots all things on its way. It had begun—it had begun! There were no more takers—the enemy was retreating—the rout was on! And so he yelled and laughed in delirium; and the[120] crowd, crushed tightly about the post, went mad likewise, with terror or joy, as the case might be. There were men there who were losing a million with every point—the millions that van Rensselaer was winning. And they saw defeat and ruin glaring at them with fiery eyes. So they raged and screamed for some one to buy T. \u0026 S.—to buy it at one fifty-six! to buy it at one fifty-five! to buy it at one fifty-three! And there was no longer any one to buy it at any price. So it was that the hurricane burst, in all its fury; it was not a panic, it was chaos and destruction let loose. The stock was \"turned\" at last; its supporters beaten; and the public, the great terror-stricken public, plunged in to overwhelm it. The price went no longer by fractions, no longer even by points; it went by three points, by five points, by ten points. Its speed was regulated by nothing but the time it took electricity to spread the panic through the whole country, for messages to come in bidding brokers to sell at any price. And[121] in the meantime, of course, there stood van Rensselaer\u0027s bull-voiced agent hammering it down by five and by ten points at a bound with his twenty thousand shares to sell. The mad frenzy had gone on until van Rensselaer could no longer bear the strain, and backed out of the crowd and sat down and laughed and sobbed like an overwrought child. It was half an hour before he could command himself again; and then T. \u0026 S. was at seventy-six, and finding takers at last! That meant that the \"shorts\" were \"covering,\" buying the stock they needed, and reaping their rewards; and so the awful panic at last was coming to an end. Van Rensselaer had estimated the true value of T. \u0026 S. at ninety, and so he sought out his brokers and bade them buy all there was to be had. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88303.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
