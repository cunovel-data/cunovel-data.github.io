{"id":23525,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Mr. Robert van Rensselaer drove on to the depot, where stood his private car; as he sped away to the city he first took something to drink, and then sat smoking and meditating until the depot was reached. Here he heard street voices: \"Extra! Extra!\" and bought a paper. He stepped into his automobile, with the word \"Home,\" and then settled back to read the news. There was the whole scene of the conference, with the embellishments of the usual kind, and the story of the strike resolutions and the beginning of rioting. There were also some savage editorials—it was a \"yellow\" journal. Mr. Robert van Rensselaer read them and smiled. He arrived at his residence,—which, it should be added, was no longer a little apartment, but a palatial mansion just a few blocks above the paternal one. As he was[41] still meditating about the strike, it was with a start that he came back to himself when the butler, who opened the door for him, remarked:— \"I beg pardon, sir. There\u0027s a lady in the parlor to see you.\" Mr. van Rensselaer opened his eyes. \"A lady?\" he said. \"A lady, I presume, sir,\" said the butler. \"What\u0027s her name?\" \"She didn\u0027t give any name, sir. She just said she must see you; and she would not take any refusal, sir.\" \"Humph!\" said the other. \"I\u0027ll go in.\" And so in he went and gazed at the woman, who wore a heavy veil. She rose up and flung it aside, disclosing a face ghastly white, and so like a death\u0027s head that the other started back. \"Do you know me?\" she asked. \"Er—no,\" said Mr. van Rensselaer. \"You really don\u0027t know me, Robbie?\" And then suddenly he gave a gasp, and cried, \"Daisy!\" [42]\"Yes,\" said the other, \"Daisy.\" They sat for a full minute gazing at each other: she at a well-filled face and waist-coat; he at a trembling skeleton. \"Well?\" said he, suddenly; \"what do you want?\" \"Nothing much,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m dying, you know, Robbie.\" \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked he. \"Consumption.\" \"Humph! It\u0027s been a long time. What have you been doing?\" \"I\u0027ve been living up north—in Albany. I took another name, you know, as soon as I left New York. There\u0027s a child, Robbie.\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed the other. \"Sure enough! A boy?\" \"No, a girl.\" \"Humph! Must be—let\u0027s see—twelve years old now.\" \"Thirteen, Robbie. That\u0027s what I\u0027ve come to see you about.\" \"So I guessed. Is she here—in New York?\" [43]\"No; she\u0027s up in Albany—with some kind people. I couldn\u0027t bear to bring her; but I—I—\" The woman stopped and gazed into his eyes a moment. Then she went on swiftly, stretching out her lean arms to him. \"Do something for her, Robbie, won\u0027t you? That\u0027s what I want. I\u0027m not for this world long, and I can\u0027t help her, but you can. I\u0027ve led a hard life, but she hasn\u0027t an idea of it; she has the locket you gave me, but I\u0027ve kept the secret from her, and she doesn\u0027t even know her father\u0027s name. I\u0027ve never bothered you, Robbie; but do for her what you might have done for me.\" \"I imagine the old gentleman did pretty well by you, didn\u0027t he?\" said the other in a matter-of-fact way. \"I\u0027m not complaining,\" said she. \"Only promise you\u0027ll find her and do something for her. It won\u0027t hurt you—do promise me, do.\" The woman\u0027s voice quivered, and she leaned forward in the chair, steadying her shaking form. The other, always a kind-hearted[44] man, was touched. \"I will, Daisy,\" he said, \"I will.\" \"You promise me?\" gasped the woman. \"Yes, I promise you.\" All right,\" said she, starting to rise. \"That\u0027s all I want. You won\u0027t have any trouble in finding her. Her name—her—\" And then suddenly she staggered. She lurched backward, grasping at the chair, and turned white, a horrible sound coming from her throat. The man leaped forward and caught her. She lay limp in his arms. He shouted for help, and when the butler came, sent him on the run for a cab. \"Take her around the corner to the hospital,\" he commanded. So they bore out the gasping form; and Mr. Robert van Rensselaer went slowly and thoughtfully upstairs. \"Devilish annoying,\" he mused. \"How shall I find the girl after that?\" When the butler came back he inquired anxiously. \"She was dead before we got there, sir,\" said the man. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88283.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
