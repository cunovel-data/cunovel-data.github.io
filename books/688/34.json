{"id":23546,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 33","content":"Our hero made his way out of the crush, jostling past men who were crying and men who were cursing, men who were tearing their hair and men who were shaking their fists at the sky—all of them men who had lost all they owned in the world and saw ruin and starvation ahead of them. It was a fearful, a hellish scene; but van Rensselaer did not heed it, he had emotions enough of his own. They were emotions not easy to describe—emotions of a man who has made seventy or eighty dollars a share upon a million or two of shares, and who has been made the wealthiest man in New York in half an hour. Van Rensselaer the elder came hobbling into the office a few moments later and flung his arms about his son. \"Robbie!\" he gasped, \"Robbie!\" and could say no more, for he was choking. Shrike and the other three[123] were close behind him, and the five gentlemen went beside themselves with rejoicing—now singing, now laughing, now dancing about, now falling on each other\u0027s necks. I have said five; for van Rensselaer the younger, strange to say, joined them but halfway. Now he would sit back in the chair and laugh nervously, while his father told over the unthinkable sums he had gained, and his heart throbbed with exultation; but then a few seconds later he would be sitting staring in front of him, his quivering hands wandering aimlessly about. \"Poor Robbie!\" said the fond father; \"it\u0027s easy to see he\u0027s done up. Here, have a drop.\" He was surprised to see Robbie gulp down the contents of a flask at one draught. For now the strain was over, the dreadful pressure gone; and Robert van Rensselaer\u0027s nervousness was suddenly coming back. While the others were still at the stage where it was possible for them to embrace each other, he arose and excused himself and went out. [124]He went down to the street, where men were still crying aloud in their grief, and staggered away. He went on aimlessly, bending his brows and clenching his hands, and wrestling in his soul to keep before him the fact that he was the richest man in New York. But he could not do it; and then suddenly, with a wild, desperate resolve, he sprang into a cab and shouted an address. He was at the river-side in a few minutes, and there lay the Comet. It was a wild day on the river; a gale had been raging, and the waves were high even in the bay; but Robert van Rensselaer thought nothing of that as he rushed on board and called for the captain. \"Steam up!\" he shouted. \"Put off the instant you are able.\" The captain stared at him in consternation. \"To go where?\" he cried. \"To put to sea,\" answered the other. \"But the storm! Surely—\" \"Curse the storm!\" the man yelled. \"Put to sea, I tell you, and get me out of this town. Do you understand? Why don\u0027t you start?\" [125]\"But half the crew is away, Mr. van Rensselaer; and provisions—\" \"I told you to get ready!\" yelled Robbie. \"Get ready! Do as I tell you, and don\u0027t argue with me. Get on board what you can, only leave this place the first instant you have steam up. Now go on!\" And he turned and staggered into the cabin. While men rushed about on the deck, and the fires burned bright below, he sat with another bottle of liquor before him; and when at last the Comet slipped away from her dock, he was sunk against the table in a drunken stupor. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88304.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
