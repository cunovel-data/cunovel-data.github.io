{"id":23541,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 28","content":"Mary Harrison was reeling like a drunken person; she clutched at a chair. \"Jim,\" she gasped, \"what\u0027s to become of me?\" \"You know that I\u0027ll always see that you are taken care of,\" he began. \"I don\u0027t—I don\u0027t mean that,\" she cried. \"But, oh—I love you—I can\u0027t do without you! Where in Heaven\u0027s name am I to go?\" and she flung herself upon him with a passionate cry. \"What am I to do?\" she cried, again and again. \"How can I bear it?\" He strove to calm her. \"Listen,\" he whispered, \"don\u0027t take it so hard. Perhaps you may forget me—please don\u0027t act like that.\" She was shuddering convulsively. \"No, no!\" she cried. \"It would kill me—it would!\" And then suddenly she leapt to her feet, her eyes blazing. \"I\u0027ll kill that[102] woman!\" she panted. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ll do!\" The man drew her to him again, striving to calm her. \"No, no, Mary,\" he said. \"That will only make it worse for me. If you love me, you must give me up. That is the only way.\" She sat there, white and trembling, moaning to herself. She smoothed the beautiful hair back from her forehead, and sat staring in front of her with a dazed expression. \"Give you up!\" she whispered hoarsely. \"Give you up!\" Her companion felt extremely uncomfortable; naturally, a good-hearted man does not like to make a woman suffer, especially a woman whom he still loves. He had made up his mind, however, and he meant to carry it through. He let her lean on his bosom and sob away her grief. \"And can\u0027t I ever see you—even just a little bit?\" she moaned. \"No,\" he said firmly. \"Can you not see, Mary, that there is no place in the[103] world where I could keep you that that woman could not track me to? She has found me out and tracked me here already and she could ruin me, Mary, drive me to kill myself.\" The other shuddered. \"No,\" she said, \"you must not do that. You are right, and I must make the sacrifice. I will go—I can bear it, I guess. But oh, Jim, I never really loved any one but you, and I never shall.\" \"I shall never forget you,\" said he. \"And I will give you all you need, Mary,—you won\u0027t have to worry about money.\" But the girl scarcely heard him; she was not thinking about money. \"And where will you go?\" he asked finally. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said she. \"I have no home. Where should I go? I suppose I\u0027ll go back where I came from—back to Albany.\" Robert van Rensselaer looked at her; the name Albany brought back a sudden memory to him. \"Well, I declare,\" he[104] said, \"you did not tell me you came from Albany.\" He hesitated a moment and then went on, \"Perhaps, maybe, you know a girl there—But I don\u0027t know her name,\" he added, with a slight laugh. \"Then I\u0027m afraid I couldn\u0027t tell you,\" said the other, answering his smile. \"But I knew very few people there. I never knew any one at all until after my mother went away some years ago.\" \"Went away?\" asked the other. \"I thought you said she died.\" \"She must have died, for she was very ill,\" said the girl. \"But I don\u0027t know what became of her—she never came back.\" The man was gazing at her in surprise. \"Never came back?\" he echoed; and then he added, \"What was your mother\u0027s name?\" \"Helen,\" said she; and he sunk back. \"Ah, it was an awful thing,\" went on the girl, her voice trembling. \"Poor, dear mother, how hard she worked to take care of me—and how good she was! She[105] worked herself to death, Jim, that\u0027s the truth.\" \"What was the matter with her?\" \"She had consumption,\" said the girl, and she saw him start. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" she asked. \"Nothing,\" said he, \"that is—it\u0027s just a queer coincidence; but what was your father\u0027s name?\" \"I never knew anything about my father,\" said the girl. \"Mother never told me; but I always suspected that he had not married her—that is—\" She stopped again, for his manner was strange; then, however, she went on. \"I think he was rich,\" she said, \"and very handsome and good. She gave me a locket with his picture that she said only he would have the key to open; she had lost the one he gave her.\" And again she stopped; a ghastly, ashen pallor had come over the face of Robert van Rensselaer; he leaned close to her, his eyes, his whole face, looming large with horror. His hand shook like an[106] autumn leaf as he stretched it out to her. \"A locket! a locket!\" he gasped. \"My God! Have you got it?\" \"Yes,\" cried the girl, in astonishment, and she went to the bureau. She held it to him as he ran toward her, and he took one glance at it and staggered back like a man struck to the heart with a knife. He gave one wild, horrible cry, and clutched his hands to his head, and reeled, and would have fallen. But Mary had sprung to him in terror. \"Jim! Jim!\" she cried, \"what is it?\" She would have caught him, but he shrunk from her touch as from a wild beast. \"No! no!\" he screamed, and crouched in the corner with eyes of dreadful fear. \"No! go back!\" \"But, Jim,\" cried the girl, \"what is it? What is the matter?\" The man had sunk down on his knees, shaking convulsively. \"O my God!\" he was gasping, \"O my God!\" Mary sprang to him again, and flung her arms about him. \"Jim! Jim!\" she cried[107] hysterically, \"you must tell me what it is—you must—you must! Do you know who my father was?\" \"Yes,\" he gasped, writhing, \"I know—I know!\" \"And who was he? Who? Tell me!\" He choked and caught his breath again; but he could not say the words. As he felt the warmth of her breath and the pressure of her arms about him, it sent a sudden shudder through his frame, and he flung her away with a force that sent her reeling across the floor. Then he staggered to his feet, and with a moan he rushed to the door. He caught one glimpse of the girl\u0027s face, and then fled madly down the steps. Outside his cab was waiting. He did not see it, and started away; but the driver shouted to him, and that brought him to his senses for an instant. He leaped in. \"Drive! drive!\" he panted. \"Where to?\" asked the man. \"Anywhere,\" he screamed. \"Drive!\" And so they whirled away down the[108] street, van Rensselaer crouching in a corner, writhing and twisting his hands together. There was a thought that came over him every few seconds like a spasm and made him cry out. He could not bear it very long; he shouted to the driver to stop, and sprang out, and flung him some money. They were in a deserted portion of the park, and he turned and fled away into the darkness. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88299.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
