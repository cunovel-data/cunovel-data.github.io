{"id":23519,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"Enough has been told about Mr. Robert van Rensselaer\u0027s early period to indicate how those pleasant days were passed. Including the suite, the flat, and the clubs, the automobile, the yacht, and the polo stud, our friend\u0027s total expenses came to something in the neighborhood of three hundred thousand a year. And since, if he had been a master-poet, or an inspired musician, or a prophet with a new message for mankind, society would have paid about one one-thousandth of that sum to keep him alive, it is apparent that he was considered by society to be equivalent to one thousand such hypothetical persons. This idyllic existence continued for about three years all together; and then one bright winter day Robbie was invited to pay a call upon his father at his office, where the two had a long and serious conversation. [22]\"Now, Robbie,\" said van Rensselaer senior, \"I haven\u0027t objected to your wild oats. That\u0027s every young fellow\u0027s right, and you haven\u0027t gone beyond the limit. I have always meant to give my son everything a gentleman ought to have; but now I think it\u0027s about time you\u0027d had enough—don\u0027t you?\" \"Um-m,\" said Robbie, meditatively, \"I hadn\u0027t thought about it.\" \"You know,\" said van Rensselaer père, \"the life of man isn\u0027t all play. We have some serious duties in the world—we owe something to society.\" \"Yes,\" said Robbie, \"I suppose so. But it\u0027s the hell of a nuisance.\" \"It may seem so,\" said the other; \"but one can get interested in the end.\" \"Perhaps so,\" admitted Robbie, dubiously. \"What I mean,\" said the father, \"is that it\u0027s time you got ready to take your place in the world. You\u0027ve seen life pretty much, and you know what I mean. You can\u0027t always be your father\u0027s son; you\u0027ll have to[23] be yourself. I may die some day, and then somebody\u0027ll have to take over my affairs. Then, too, you might want to marry; you\u0027ve wanted to twice already, you know\" (Robbie blushed), \"and if you have a family, you\u0027ll find they\u0027ll expect from you pretty much what you\u0027ve had from me. The life of man, my boy, is a battle; and there comes a time when every one has to fight it.\" Robbie had never known his father to be philosophical before, and found it a curious experience; their talk was prolonged late into the afternoon, and by that time Robbie had expressed his willingness to make an effort to perform some of his duties to society.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88277.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
