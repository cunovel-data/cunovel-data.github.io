{"id":23523,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 10","content":"In the first place, the president was in an angry mood when he went to that conference. The sailing of the Comet had had to be postponed yet another day, and besides that a stone had been flung at his head only five minutes before. I mention the stone particularly because, as I have said, an unfortunate incident occurred at the conference. They sat at a long table one October afternoon,—eight men, seven of them pale and trembling, fingering their hats and gazing about them nervously, with long agony written on their faces, a certain hunted look that sportsmen know, but do not heed. And Mr. Robert van Rensselaer—it has been some time since we have looked at him. He was a gentleman of forty now, grown somewhat portly and a little florid, but not too much so. He had always been a man of distinction—you would have taken[33] him for a diplomat, or a general, at the very least. He was a little pale just then about the lips, and he began the conference in a tone whose calmness any one could have told was forced. He began at the beginning—he explained the losses of the mills, and how they were barely established now. He mentioned the new machinery, and showed the cost of it. He laid before them a great mass of papers, and made plain how the new machinery had increased the output and been equivalent to a raise. He went on to the price of billets, he showed the state of the market with elaborately marshalled figures, and proved what the price must soon be. To all of which, a speech of nearly two hours, the men listened fixedly. Afterward one of the delegates, a little wiry, black-bearded Hungarian, took up the question. He wandered from the point at once, discussing the price of food, and the condition of the workingmen, much to the president\u0027s annoyance. The latter tried to[34] bring him back to the point at issue—he returned to the papers again, and they argued back and forth for a long time. Several times Mr. van Rensselaer choked down an angry word. \"You talk to me about the condition of the workingmen,\" he exclaimed, tapping on the table with his pencil. \"But how can I help the condition of the workingmen? You say his wages are not living wages—but who can decide a question such as that? What one man can live on, another cannot. What if the workingmen spend much of their wages in intemperance, and then tell me they cannot live? What—\" But then the president stopped, and frowning with annoyance, went on in a different voice: \"But there is no use arguing about such questions as that! I have tried to explain to you the state of the market, and just what the Company can do. I can do nothing more. You must remember that we have trials, also, and that ruin is possible for companies, too. The laws of economy apply to companies just as well[35] as men; there are living wages for companies—\" The president stopped, and immediately the argumentative delegate observed, \"We do not see any signs that the Company is afflicted with poverty.\" The president gazed at him sharply. \"Hey?\" he asked. \"I say,\" repeated the man in a louder voice, \"that anybody can go through this town and see what is happening to the workingmen. I know of a child that died yesterday of hunger, but I don\u0027t read that any of the officers of the Company are suffering from want.\" A flush shot over the president\u0027s face. \"Do you mean to be impertinent?\" he cried. \"I mean nothing of the kind,\" said the man, amid breathless silence. \"But you have not hesitated to talk of the workingman\u0027s intemperance—\" And Mr. Robert van Rensselaer clutched the table. \"Now,\" he cried, \"this thing\u0027s gone far enough, and we\u0027ll settle it right[36] now! You might as well quit your nonsense and understand this,—that the Hungerville Mills belong to Robert van Rensselaer, and not to a union, or to anybody else; and that they\u0027re going to be run the way Robert van Rensselaer chooses they shall be run; that they\u0027re run for his profit, that the wages they pay are the wages he chooses to pay, and that anybody who doesn\u0027t like it is welcome to go wherever else it happens to suit him! And you go out and give that as my message, and, damn it, don\u0027t you ever come up here into my office to insult me again!\" Then he stopped, purple with rage; and for half a minute the members of the union stared at him and at each other. Finally they arose and made their way from the room, leaving the president glaring at the closed door. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88281.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
