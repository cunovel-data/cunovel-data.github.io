{"id":23536,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"No one knew that van Rensselaer was the man who was causing the trouble to T. \u0026 S., so our historian goes on to assure us. One of his qualities was his mastership of concealment: he had brokers all over Wall Street, and often they were bidding against each other without knowing it. Those on the outside saw merely that T. \u0026 S. had gone up in a way that beat all telling, and that then it had found a steady price and was marvellously active; those on the inside knew a little more; they knew that somebody was selling short, but who it was, there was only one man in the world that knew. These things are complicated, and they are tedious; but they have to be understood, for they have to do with a crisis in the life of Robert van Rensselaer. For our friend was not a man who played at stocks; he[82] never went in until he was sure he was right, and then he went in for all he was worth. Though as yet the market had not the least idea of it, he was stripped for a battle to the death with the supporters of Transatlantic and Suburban. Let the reader plunge boldly in,—and take our word for it that there is a path through the wilderness of the narrative. It was on Tuesday that van Rensselaer had begun, taking \"seller\u0027s options\" of three days, which amounted to a gigantic bet that in three days, by more and more selling, he could lower the price of the stock. As a matter of fact he meant to give them no three days; he meant that T. \u0026 S. was to go down on Wednesday, the first real day of battle. It was a situation like that in the K. A. corner, with the difference that nobody could think of cornering T. \u0026 S. Its stock was all over the country, it had been issued ten millions at a time, and what van Rensselaer and his opponents could secure was comparatively little; it was[83] the market, the spectators of the battle, who were to award the prize of victory at the end. And as we have said, our hero had, or believed he had, the \"eternal laws of nature\" on his side. \"It\u0027s coming down!\" said van Rensselaer, grimly; \"down! down!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88294.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
