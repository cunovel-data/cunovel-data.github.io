{"id":23516,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Many lads would have been spoiled by so much attention; and so it is only fair to say at the outset that \"Robbie\" was never spoiled; that to the end of his days he was what is known as \"a good fellow,\" and that it was only when he could not have what he wanted that anger ever appeared in his eyes. Before many more years he went away to a great rich school, followed by the prayers of a family, and by the valet and the groom. There he had a suite of rooms, and two horses, and a pair of dogs with pedigrees longer than his own; and there he learned to smoke a brand of choice cigarettes, and to play poker, and to take a proper interest in race-track doings. There also, just when he was ready to come away and to take a great college by storm, Robbie met with an exciting adventure.[12] This is a work of realism, and works of realism always go into detail as to such matters; and so it must be explained that Robbie fell desperately in love with a pretty girl who lived in the country near the school; and that Robbie was young and handsome and wealthy and witty, and by no means disposed to put up with not having his own way; and that he had it; and that when he came to leave school, the girl fled from home and followed him; and that there were some blissful months in the city, and then some complications; and that when the crisis came Robbie was just on the point of getting married when the curiosity of his father was excited by his heavy financial demands; and, finally, that Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer and Mr. Robert van Rensselaer held an interview in the former\u0027s study. \"Now, Robbie,\" said he, \"how long has this been going on?\" \"About a year, sir,\" said Robbie, gazing at the floor. \"A year? Humph! And why didn\u0027t[13] you tell me about it when you first got into trouble?\" \"I—I didn\u0027t like to,\" said Robbie. \"To be sure,\" said the father, \"boys have no business in such scrapes; but still, when you get in them, it is your duty to tell me. And so you want to get married?\" \"I—I love her,\" said the other, turning various shades of red as he found the words sounding queer. \"But, Robbie,\" protested van Rensselaer père, \"one doesn\u0027t marry all the women one loves.\" Then, after a little pause, the father continued gravely, \"Now, my boy, tell me where she is, and I\u0027ll arrange it for you.\" Robbie started. \"You won\u0027t be cross to her?\" he pleaded. \"Of course not,\" said the father. \"I am never cross with any one. It will all be settled happily, I promise you.\" And so a day or two later it was announced that Robbie was going abroad for[14] a year\u0027s tour; and when he sought Daisy to bid her good-by, it was reported that Daisy had left for the West—a circumstance which caused Robbie several days\u0027 anxiety. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88274.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
