{"id":23539,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"So they left, and in a few minutes more our hero was in his automobile and speeding rapidly up town. He entered his club-house, and went to a private room, into which shortly after there came hobbling an aged, red-nosed, and gouty old aristocrat, swearing furiously and demanding, \"What in the devil did you want me here for, anyhow?\" It was Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer. \"Well,\" said the son, after dutifully helping him to a chair, \"what do you think of it?\" \"That\u0027s not answering my question,\" growled the other. \"But Lord, Robbie, I\u0027ve had a day of it! Do you know I hold five thousand of T. \u0026 S.? And I\u0027ve just been crazy all day, waiting—waiting—\" Humph!\" said Robert, with a smile. \"Waiting for what?\" \"Why, haven\u0027t you got any?\" cried the[93] other. \"Don\u0027t you know who\u0027s in that syndicate?\" \"Yes,\" said Robbie; \"it\u0027s the T. \u0026 S. gang, and Smith and Shark, I supposed.\" \"Yes,\" said the other, \"just so; and they mean business, too, I can tell you. You\u0027ll see this stock up in the 200\u0027s to-morrow. Who do you suppose are those fools that are fighting them?\" \"I don\u0027t suppose,\" said Robbie, \"I know.\" \"And who are they?\" \"There aren\u0027t any \u0027they.\u0027\" \"How do you mean?\" \"I mean there\u0027s only one man.\" \"What! And who is it?\" \"It\u0027s Robert van Rensselaer.\" And the old gentleman leapt from his chair, in spite of his gout. \"Good God, Robbie!\" he cried. \"You\u0027re mad!\" \"No,\" said Robbie; \"it\u0027s a fact.\" \"But you\u0027re ruined!\" \"Oh, no, not quite, Governor. (Robbie always had called him Governor.) I\u0027ve spent every cent I own, but not quite ruined; for[94] I\u0027m going to be the richest man in New York City to-morrow at about two minutes past eleven o\u0027clock in the morning. I\u0027m going to have every cent that the T. \u0026 S. people and Smith and Shark can beg or borrow, and the bank accounts of several hundred lambs besides, including my aged and beloved daddy!\" The aged and beloved daddy was gasping for breath. \"You\u0027re lost, Robbie!\" he cried. \"It can\u0027t be! How can you do it without money?\" \"I\u0027ve just arranged a syndicate,\" laughed Robbie. \"But without money?\" \"They don\u0027t know I\u0027ve no money,\" said he, cheerfully. \"But I\u0027m going to get some more, just for safety, from you.\" \"Humph!\" said Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer, laconically. \"In the first place,\" said the other man, \"you\u0027re going to sell those shares to-morrow morning at ten o\u0027clock; and in the second you\u0027re going to sell short on T. \u0026 S. all you find takers for; and about eleven o\u0027clock[95] you\u0027re going to see the sky fall down and hit the earth.\" \"What\u0027s going to cause it?\" \"For one thing, your being there selling short. You old Wall Street rounders are like vultures about a carcass—people will only have to see you hobbling down town, and they\u0027ll know there\u0027s a smash-up coming; and if you whisper you\u0027re selling T. \u0026 S. it\u0027ll come right then.\" \"There\u0027s something in that,\" admitted the old gentleman, after some hesitation. \"But that\u0027s not the thing I want to see you about,\" laughed Robbie. \"The main thing is still to come. It is that you\u0027re going to make me a present right away of a couple of million dollars.\" Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer bounced slightly in his chair, and his eyes were very wide open. \"Two millions, at least,\" reiterated Robbie, seeing that he was speechless. \"And give it, not lend it. If I asked you to lend it, then I\u0027d have to go into all kinds of explanations, and I couldn\u0027t ever make you[96] see the thing as plainly as I do. All I say is that I\u0027ve been a good boy and supported myself for thirteen years without ever striking my old daddy for a cent; and that now I want it and want it bad. You\u0027re going to die some day, and then you\u0027ll leave it all to me. And by that time it\u0027ll be of no use in the world to me; for if this stroke fails, it\u0027ll be too little, and if it succeeds, it won\u0027t be anything at all. And so I want you to give it to me now.\" Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer took a long, long breath; then he sat forward and drew up to the table. \"Robbie,\" he said, \"tell me about this business. Tell me all.\" \"First I want the two millions.\" \"Confound you,\" observed the other. \"Don\u0027t you know if you want \u0027em, you\u0027ll get \u0027em? But go on now, and tell me about the thing, and don\u0027t be a fool.\" And so Robbie told him; and before the end of it the elder gentleman was rubbing his hands. Afterwards he hobbled out of the room and mailed a note to his brokers, ordering them to sell his T. \u0026 S. holdings at[97] the opening price; also he wrote instructing his bankers that Mr. Robert van Rensselaer was to draw on his credit for three million dollars. * * * * * * * And in the meantime Mr. Robert van Rensselaer was still pacing up and down the room, his hands behind his back, and a very pleasant look upon his mellow countenance. He was at that moment, beyond question, the happiest and the contentedest man in New York: when all of a sudden there was a knock on the door, and an attendant entered. \"A note for you, sir,\" he said. \"It\u0027s marked \u0027Urgent.\u0027\" And our friend took it; he waited until the man had gone, and then he opened it, and read this:— \"Mr. Robert van Rensselaer: \"Dear Sir,—Will you kindly request our friend Mr. Green to call this evening upon a matter of the utmost possible urgency to him at the house of his old friend Mrs. Lynch?\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88297.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
