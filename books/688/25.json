{"id":23537,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"The powers that stood behind T. \u0026 S. held a meeting that Tuesday afternoon and formed a syndicate. The unknown person who was \"bearing\" the stock must be whipped into line without a moment\u0027s delay, they agreed; and on the morrow they arranged to buy up one hundred and fifty thousand shares of T. \u0026 S. and see if he could stand that. Van Rensselaer was prepared to stand a good deal. On Tuesday, the market being strong, he had sold out every share of stock he owned, including even his K. A. holdings, including even all his interest in the great steel corporation he had made; and likewise he had borrowed upon his credit every dollar that he dared. All this cash was at his broker\u0027s, and on Wednesday morning when the market opened he was standing in his private office by the ticker,[85] with his one trusted clerk at hand to telephone his orders. The struggle opened slowly, the two giants sparring and feeling each other\u0027s strength. The syndicate brokers called loudly for T. \u0026 S., but van Rensselaer waited and watched. Some was sold, but it was not his; he was waiting to see if the price would not go up yet higher, to make his enemies bolder, and himself safer. And about eleven o\u0027clock it did start. T. \u0026 S. had opened at 155, and trading brisk; five thousand shares had been sold, and then the price went to 1551?2 to 1561?2. Then again it went on to 158, and there it stopped. Evidently that was as high as the enemy cared to send it; and after a while van Rensselaer sent his orders,—two thousand shares to five different brokers. T. \u0026 S. wavered, went to 1575?8, then rallied; sales fifteen thousand. Robert sent out again; offers were still being made, and his agents took them. In the board-room one might have seen a frantic crowd of shrieking, gesticulating men about the T. \u0026 S. post; such[86] trading had not been seen for months—something was surely \"up.\" As yet it was not perceived that the bull movement was a defensive one, and wild rumors flew about: the Ghoul and Castoria interests were fighting for the road; Mergem was going to run it to Alaska. T. \u0026 S. had never touched such a point before—surely it could not stay there. And yet it did stay there, while offer after offer was made. It was not till noon that it started down; and by that time the syndicate had bought its one hundred and fifty thousand shares, of which van Rensselaer had sold them one hundred and thirty thousand. And now his brokers were shouting offers, and the price was settling steadily. The syndicate was again in hurried consultation; it was evident by this time that some powerful foe was against them in full force. Their peril was imminent and deadly; for the moment that the street perceived a bear attack, alarm would spread; and after that thousands would watch in wild uncertainty, and a single point might bring the panic,[87] might fling thousands and hundreds of thousands of shares upon one side of the trembling balance. With only a few minutes\u0027 discussing, the syndicate pledged three hundred thousand more. The market was in a frenzy; T. \u0026 S. went to 1571?2, and there held. The brokers of the syndicate were making the board-room ring with their shouts; and van Rensselaer, calm and ready, sold them all they wanted, and every single time that they let up, began to bear the stock. The result was that its value swayed back and forth, now gaining and now losing a point, the trading in the meantime being furious. The meaning of it all was fast becoming plain,—that some conspirators were trying to break the stock, and that those conspirators were of the giants. Robert van Rensselaer was calculated to be worth some twenty million dollars at that day; and that meant that at the present price of the stock he was in a position to buy about a million and a quarter shares. Whether his enemies could go that far he did not know; but he[88] sat grimly and watched the ticker, while the fierce battle raged and sounds of frenzied excitement came up from the street below. So the hours crawled by, the three long weary hours more; and one by one he hurled his blows, and one by one they came to nothing. He was not a nervous man, and he did not drum the table; but his brow darkened and he swore softly. He was staking all that he owned against the unknown power of his opponents; and if he did not break them with his last offer, he would be without a dollar in the world. And so came the last few dreadful minutes of that ever memorable day of frenzy. There were a dozen brokers shouting his gigantic offers; there was one case where twenty thousand shares changed hands in one block. He emptied his quiver, he made the market reel and men turn white with terror; but his every order was snapped up on the instant, and T. \u0026 S. never gave an inch! And so the moment of closing came; and the dreadful day was at an end. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88295.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
