{"id":23538,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"Robert van Rensselaer paced his office, his hands behind his back. He had no more money, but he was not frightened; his trust was in the eternal laws of nature,—and besides, he had one or two more cards to play. He was walking up and down meditatively, talking to himself half aloud. \"I think,\" he was saying, \"that I\u0027ve gotten all the best of the pickings; and so it really won\u0027t do so much harm if I let them in.\" He rang for his secretary and sent five telephone messages. Four of them were to friends of his, Wall Street plungers who had generally worked and fought with him; and the fifth was to Mr. Chauncey van Rensselaer. It was only a few minutes before the first four were in his office, breathless and wild. \"Well,\" said van Rensselaer, \"what do you think of it?\" [90]\"Never saw anything like it,\" cried one of them; it was Shrike, the famous wheat plunger. \"Never in my life! Who do you think it is? And what\u0027ll come of it?\" \"That\u0027s what I sent for you for,\" was van Rensselaer\u0027s reply. \"Sit down.\" And then he talked to them. \"I know who\u0027s in this, but I\u0027m not at liberty to tell. But I know that they\u0027re going to win out, and I\u0027m going to jump on to-morrow morning with every cent I have and help make it a smash-up. I know who\u0027s back of the T. \u0026 S. people,—it\u0027s Smith and Shark, in particular,—and I know just what they\u0027re good for. I know T. \u0026 S. pretty well, too, and it\u0027s hanging on the very verge. It\u0027s damned inflated stuff—you know that, as well as I do; and the street\u0027s just ready to jump on the losing side. The ring that\u0027s been making this fight is going to get most of it; but I\u0027m going to get some, and I\u0027m asking you in so as to make it a sure thing. We\u0027ve only got to pile on to it, you know, and then suddenly let the street find out[91] that it\u0027s us. The tumble will come in three seconds after that.\" It was several hours before those four gentlemen went out of van Rensselaer\u0027s office. They talked the situation over in all its phases: the weak points about the T. \u0026 S. road, and the rumors that might be used; the impossibility of their being caught in a corner; the fact that thousands of stockholders were hoping for a rise, and trembling in uncertainty and terror at the thought of a fall; the resources of Smith and Shark and the T. \u0026 S. financiers; their own resources, and the weight of their names. In the end the agreement was to buy all the T. \u0026 S. offered in the morning, and at the hour of eleven jump in and pound it into the dust. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229/88296.html","bookId":688,"book":{"id":688,"title":"A Captain of Industry","description":"简介： I purpose in this chronicle to tell the story of A Civilized Man: casting aside all Dreams and Airy Imaginations, and dealing with that humble Reality which lies at our doorsteps....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3229","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:09 AM"}}
