{"id":2689,"title":"Raising Kane (Rough Riders #9)","description":"Storyline: Raising Kane (Rough Riders #9) \\n She surrendered the reins. Now he\u0027s raising the stakes. \\n When a patch of ice sends attorney Ginger Paulson head-over-high-heels down a flight of stairs, she has no one to care for her young son and her invalid father - until lethally sexy Kane McKay shows up at the hospital, determined to prove his cowboy chivalry. Past experience has inoculated her against take-charge men, but even Ginger isn\u0027t immune to Kane\u0027s invasive charm and Built Ford Tough body. \\n For two years rancher Kane McKay has followed the Little Buddies mentoring program\u0027s cardinal rule - hands off his Little Buddy Hayden\u0027s mama. But one look at Ginger\u0027s bruised body and Kane is through watching the stubborn woman take care of everyone but herself. The feisty, curvy redhead needs his help, and he\u0027ll give her the hands-on type whether she likes it or not. \\n After Kane throws out doctor\u0027s orders and issues his own demands - her full sexual submission - Ginger realizes Kane\u0027s caring nature extends beyond just fulfilling her physical needs. \\n Can the former hell-raiser convince the gun-shy single mom to look beyond his past - toward a shared future? \\n Warning: Contains one sweet and hot hunk of cowboy manflesh who uses every sexual trick in the book to render a sassy, fast-talking attorney speechless and put a new twist on the term \"binding arbitration\".\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/raising-kane-rough-riders-9.jpg","author":"Lorelei James","type":"Western","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":8,"name":"Western","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
