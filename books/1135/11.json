{"id":22631,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Paul had gone home too, and was feeling his way upstairs in the dark: he dimly remembered going up some stairs in the dark like this when he was a boy, but he could not remember where it had been. Now, as then, he had the feeling that there was some danger near him which he could only escape by strict attention to what he was doing. He reached the landing, he stood before his own door, he was safe. But he hesitated an instant before opening it, then crossed over and tapped lightly with the knuckle of his forefinger at his mother\u0027s door and entered without waiting for a reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is I,\" he said brusquely; \"don\u0027t light the candle, I have something to tell you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He heard her turning round in her bed, the straw mattress creaking under her: but he could not see her, he did not want to see her; their two souls must speak together in the darkness as though they had already passed to the world beyond. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it you, Paul? I was dreaming,\" she said in a sleepy yet frightened voice; \"I thought I heard dancing, some one playing on the flute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother, listen,\" he said, paying no attention to her words. \"That woman, Agnes, is ill. She has been ill since this morning. She had a fall; it seems she hurt her head and is bleeding from her nose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean it, Paul? Is she in danger?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In the darkness her voice sounded alarmed, yet at the same time incredulous. He went on, repeating the breathless words of the servant: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It happened this morning, after she got the letter. All day long she was pale and refused to eat, and this evening she grew worse and fell into convulsions.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He knew that he was exaggerating, and stopped: his mother did not speak. For a moment in the silence and the night there was a deathlike tension, as though two enemies were seeking each other in the darkness and seeking in vain. Then the straw mattress creaked again; his mother must have raised herself to a sitting position in the high bed, because her clear voice now seemed to come from above. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Paul, who told you all this? Perhaps it is not true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again he felt that it was his conscience speaking to him through her, but he answered at once: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be true. But that is not the question, mother. It is that I fear she may commit some folly. She is alone in the hands of servants, and I must see her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Paul!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must,\" he repeated, raising his voice almost to a shout; but it was himself he was trying to convince, not his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Paul, you promised!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know I promised, and for that very reason I have come to tell you before I go. I tell you that it is necessary that I should go to her; my conscience bids me go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me one thing, Paul: are you sure you saw the servant? Temptation plays evil tricks on us and the devil has many disguises.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not quite understand her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You think I am telling a lie? I saw the servant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen—last night I saw the old priest, and I thought I heard his footsteps again just now. Last night,\" she went on in a low voice, \"he sat beside me before the fire. I actually saw him, I tell you: he had not shaved, and the few teeth he had left were black from too much smoking. And he had holes in his stockings. And he said, \u0027I am alive and I am here, and very soon I shall turn you and your son out of the presbytery.\u0027 And he said I ought to have taught you your father\u0027s trade if I did not wish you to fall into sin. He so upset my mind, Paul, that I don\u0027t know whether I have acted rightly or wrongly! But I am absolutely sure that it was the devil sitting beside me last night, the spirit of evil. The servant you saw might have been temptation in another shape.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled in the darkness. Nevertheless, when he thought of the fantastic figure of the servant running across the meadow, he felt a vague sense of terror in spite of himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you go there,\" continued his mother\u0027s voice, \"are you certain you will not fall again? Even if you really saw the servant and if that woman is really ill, are you sure not to fall?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She broke off suddenly; she seemed to see his pale face through the darkness, and she was filled with pity for him. Why should she forbid him to go to the woman? Supposing Agnes really died of grief? Supposing Paul died of grief? And she was as wracked with uncertainty as he had been in the case of Antiochus. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord,\" she sighed; then she remembered that she had already placed herself in the hands of God, Who alone can solve all our difficulties. She felt a sort of relief, as if she had really settled the problem. And had she not settled it by entrusting it in the hands of God? \\n\\n \\n\\n She lay back on her pillow and her voice came again nearer to her son. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If your conscience bids you go, why did you not go at once instead of coming in here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I promised. And you threatened to leave me if I went back to that house. I swore....\" he said with infinite sadness. And he longed to cry out, \"Mother, force me to keep my oath!\" but the words would not come. And then she spoke again: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then go: do whatever your conscience bids you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not be anxious,\" he said, coming close up to the bed; and he stood there motionless for a few minutes and both were silent. He had a confused impression that he was standing before an altar with his mother lying upon it like some mysterious idol, and he remembered how, when he was a boy in the Seminary, he was always obliged to go and kiss her hand after he had been to confession. And something of the same repugnance and the same exaltation moved him now. He felt that if he had been alone, without her, he would have gone back to Agnes long since, worn out by that endless day of flight and strife; but his mother held him in check, and he did not know whether he was grateful to her or not. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not be anxious!\" Yet all the time he longed and feared that she would say more to him, or that she would light the lamp and, looking into his eyes, read all his thoughts and forbid him to go. But she said nothing. Then the mattress creaked again as she stretched herself in the bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he went out. \\n\\n \\n\\n He reflected that after all he was not a scoundrel: he was not going with any bad motive or moved by passion, but because he honestly thought that there might be some danger he could avert, and the responsibility for this danger rested upon him. He recalled the fantastic figure of the servant running across the moonlit grass, and turning back to look at him with bright eyes as she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My little mistress will take courage if only you will come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And all his efforts to break away from her appeared now base and stupid: his duty was to have gone to her at once and given her courage. And as he crossed the meadow, silvery in the moonlight, he felt relieved, almost happy, he was like a moth attracted by the light. And he mistook the joy he felt at the prospect of seeing Agnes again in a few moments for the satisfaction of doing his duty in going to save her. All the sweet scent of the grass, all the tender radiance of the moon bathed and purified his soul, and the healing dew fell upon it even through his clothes of deathlike black. \\n\\n \\n\\n Agnes, little mistress! In truth, she was little, weak as a child, and she was all alone, without father or mother, living in that labyrinth of stone, her dark house under the ridge. And he had taken advantage of her, had caught her in his hand like a bird from the nest, gripping her till the blood seemed driven from her body. \\n\\n \\n\\n He hurried on. No, he was not a bad man, but as he reached the bottom of the steps that led up to the door he stumbled, and it was sharply borne in upon him that even the stones of her threshold repulsed him. Then he mounted softly, hesitatingly, raised the knocker and let it fall. They were a long time coming to answer the door, and he felt humiliated standing there, but for nothing in the world would he have knocked a second time. At last the fanlight over the door was lit up and the dark-faced maid let him in, showing him at once into the room he knew so well. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everything was just as it had been on other nights, when Agnes had admitted him secretly by way of the orchard; the little door stood ajar, and through the narrow opening he could smell the fragrance of the bushes in the night air. The glass eyes in the stuffed heads of stags and deer on the walls shone in the steady glow of the big lamp, as though taking careful note of all that happened in the room. Contrary to custom, the door leading to the inner rooms stood wide open; the servant had gone through there and the board flooring could be heard creaking under her heavy step. After a moment a door banged violently as though blown by a gust of wind, making the whole house shake, and he started involuntarily when immediately afterwards he beheld Agnes emerge from the darkness of the inner rooms, with white face and distorted hair floating in black wisps across it, like the phantom of a drowned woman. Then the little figure came forward into the lamplight and he almost sobbed with relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n She closed the door behind her and leaned against it with bowed head. She faltered as though about to fall, and Paul ran to her, holding out his hands, but not daring to touch her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How are you?\" he asked in a low voice, as he had asked at former meetings. But she did not answer, only stood trembling all over her body, her hands pressed against the door behind her for support. \"Agnes,\" he continued after a moment\u0027s tense silence, \"we must be brave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But as on that day when he had read the Gospel words over the frenzied girl, he knew that his voice rang false, and his eyes sought the ground as Agnes raised hers, bewildered, yes, but full of mingled scorn and joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then why have you come?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard that you were ill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She drew herself up proudly and pushed back the hair from her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am quite well and I did not send for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that, but I came all the same—there was no reason why I should not come. I am glad to find that your maid exaggerated, and that you are all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she repeated, interrupting him, \"I did not send for you and you ought not to have come. But since you are here, since you are here, I want to ask you—why you did it ... why?—why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her words were broken by sobs and her hands sought blindly for support, so that Paul was afraid, and repented that he had come. He took her hands and led her to the couch where they had sat together on other evenings, placing her in the corner where the weight of other women of the family had worn a sort of niche, and seated himself beside her, but he let go her hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was afraid of touching her; she was like a statue which he had broken and put together again, and which sat there apparently whole but ready to fall in pieces again at the slightest movement. So he was afraid of touching her, and he thought to himself: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is better so, I shall be safe,\" but in his heart he knew that at any moment he might be lost again, and for that reason he was afraid of touching her. Looking closely at her beneath the lamplight, he perceived that she was changed. Her mouth was half-open, her lips discoloured and greyish like faded rose-leaves; the oval of her face seemed to have grown longer and her cheekbones stood out sharply beneath eyes sunk deep in their livid sockets. Grief had aged her by twenty years in a single day, yet there was something childlike still in the expression of her trembling lips, drawn tightly over her teeth to check her weeping, and in the little hands, one of which, lying nerveless on the dark stuff of the couch, invited his own towards it. And he was filled with anger because he dared not take that little hand in his and link up again the broken chain of their two lives. He remembered the words of the man possessed with a devil, \"What have I to do with Thee?\" and he began to speak again, clasping his hands together to prevent himself taking one of hers. But still he heard his voice ring false, and as on that morning in church when he read the Gospel, and when he carried the sacrament to the old hunter, he knew himself to be lying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Agnes, listen to me. Last night we were both on the brink of destruction—God had left us to ourselves and we were slipping over the edge of the abyss. But now God has taken us by the hand again and is guiding us. We must not fall, Agnes, Agnes,\" and his voice shook with emotion as he spoke her name. \"You think I don\u0027t suffer? I feel as if I were buried alive and that my torments would last through all eternity. But we must endure for your good, for your salvation. Listen, Agnes, be brave, for the sake of the love which united us, for God\u0027s goodwill towards us in putting us through this trial. You will forget me. You will recover; you are young, with all your life still before you. When you think of me it will be like a bad dream, as though you had lost your way in the valley and met some evil creature who had tried to do you harm; but God has saved you, as you deserved to be saved. Everything looks black at present, but it will clear up soon and you will realize that I am only acting for your good in causing you a little momentary pain now, just as we are sometimes obliged to seem cruel to those who are ill....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped, the words froze in his throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n Agnes had roused herself and was sitting upright in her corner, gazing at him with eyes as glassy as those in the stags\u0027 heads on the walls. They reminded him of the women\u0027s eyes in church, fixed on him as he preached. She waited for his words, patient and gentle in every line of her fragile form, yet ready to break down at a touch. Then speechless himself, he heard her low voice as she shook her head slowly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, that is not the truth,\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then what is the truth?\" he asked, bending his troubled face towards her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you not speak like that last night? And the other nights? Because it was a different kind of truth then. Now somebody has found you out, perhaps your mother herself, and you are afraid of the world. It is not the fear of God which is driving you away from me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He wanted to cry out, to strike her; he seized her hand and twisted the slender wrist as he would have liked to twist and stifle the words she spoke. Then he drew himself up stiffly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What then? You think it does not matter? Yes, my mother has discovered everything and she talked to me like my conscience itself. And have you no conscience? Do you think it right that we should injure those who depend on us? You wanted us to go away and live together, and that would have been the right thing to do if we had not been able to overcome our love; but since there are beings who would have been cut off from life by our flight and our sin, we had to sacrifice ourselves for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But she seemed not to understand, caught only one word, and shook her head as before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Conscience? Of course I have a conscience, I am no longer a child! And my conscience tells me that I did wrong in listening to you and letting you come here. What is to be done? It is too late now; why did not God make you see things clearly at first? I did not go to your home, but you came to mine and played with me as if I had been a child\u0027s toy. And what must I do now? Tell me that. I cannot forget you, I cannot change as you change. I shall go away, even if you will not come with me—I want to try and forget you. I must go right away, or else....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or else?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Agnes did not reply; she leaned back in her corner and shivered. Something ominous, like the dark wing of madness, must have touched her, for her eyes grew dim and she raised her hand with an instinctive movement as though to brush away a shadow from before her face. He bent again towards her, stretching across the couch and his fingers gripping and breaking through the old material as though it were a wall that rose between them and threatened to stifle him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He could not speak. Yes, she was right; the explanation he had been trying to make her believe was not the truth—it was the truth that was rising like a wall and stifling him, and which he did not know how to break down. And he sat up, battling with a real sense of suffocation. Now it was she who caught his hand and held it as though her fingers had been grappling-hooks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O God,\" she whispered, covering her eyes with her free hand, \"if there be a God, He should not have let us meet each other if we must part again. And you came to-night because you love me still. You think I don\u0027t know that? I do know, I do know, and that is the truth!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She raised her face to his, her trembling lips, her lashes wet with tears. And his eyes were dazzled as by the glitter of deep waters, a glitter that blinds and beckons, and the face he gazed into was not the face of Agnes, nor the face of any woman on this earth,—it was the face of Love itself. And he fell forward into her arms and kissed her upon the mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1712/50443.html","bookId":1135,"book":{"id":1135,"title":"The Woman and the Priest","description":"简介： The Woman and the Priest [A] is an unusual book, both in its story and its setting in a remote Sardinian hill village, half civilized and superstitious.
