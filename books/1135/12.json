{"id":22632,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"The world had ceased for Paul. He felt himself sinking slowly, swept down by a whirlpool through luminous depths to some dazzling iridescent place beneath the sea. Then he came to himself again and drew his lips away from hers, and found himself, like a ship-wrecked man upon the sand, safe though maimed, and shaking with fear and joy, but more with fear than joy. And the enchantment that he thought had been broken for ever, and for this very reason had seemed more beautiful and dear, wove its spell over him afresh and held him again in thrall. And again he heard the whisper of her voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knew you would come back to me....\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He wanted to hear no more, just as he had tried not to hear the servant\u0027s tale in the house of Antiochus. He put his hand over Agnes\u0027s mouth as she leaned her head upon his shoulder and then gently caressed her hair, on which the lamplight threw golden gleams. She was so small, so helpless in his grasp, and therein lay her terrible power to drag him down to the bottom of the sea, to raise him to the highest heights of heaven, to make of him a thing without will or desire of his own. Whilst he had fled through the valleys and the hills she had remained shut up within her prison-house, waiting in the certainty that he would come back to her, and he came. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know, you know....\" She tried to tell him more; her soft breath touched his neck like a caress, he placed his hand on her mouth again and with her own she pressed it close. And so they remained in silence for a while; then he pulled himself together and tried to regain the mastery over his fate. He had come back to her, yes, but not the same man she had expected. And his gaze still rested on her gleaming hair, but as on something far away, as on the bright sparkle of the sea from which he had escaped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you are happy,\" he whispered. \"I am here, I have come back and I am yours for life. But you must be calm, you have given me a great fright. You must not excite yourself, nor wander on any account from the straight path of your life. I shall cause you no more trouble, but you must promise me to be calm and good, as you are now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt her hands tremble and struggle between his own; he divined that she was already beginning to rebel and he held them tightly, as he would have liked to hold her soul imprisoned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear Agnes, listen! You will never know all I have suffered to-day, but it was necessary. I stripped off all the outward shell of me, all that was impure, and I scourged myself until I bled. But now here I am, yours, yours, but as God wills that I should be yours, in spirit.... You see,\" he went on, speaking slowly and laboriously, as though dragging his words up painfully from his inmost depths and offering them to her, \"it seems to me that we have loved each other for years and years, that we have rejoiced and suffered the one for the other, even unto hatred, even unto death. And all the tempests of the sea and all its implacable life are within us. Agnes, soul of my soul, what wouldst thou have of me greater than that which I can give thee, my soul itself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped short. He felt that she did not understand, she could not understand. And he beheld her ever more detached from him, as life from death; but for this very reason he loved her still, yea, more than ever, as one loves life that is dying. \\n\\n \\n\\n She slowly raised her head from his shoulder and looked him in the face with eyes grown hostile again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you listen to me,\" she said, \"and tell me no more lies. Are we or are we not going away together as we settled last night? We cannot go on living here, in this way. That is certain!... That is certain!\" she repeated with rising anger, after a moment of painful silence. \"If we are to live together we must go away at once, this very night. I have money, you know, it is my own. And your mother and my brothers and every one else will excuse us afterwards when they see that we only wanted to live according to the truth. We cannot go on living like this, no, we cannot!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Agnes!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Answer me quick! Yes or no?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot go away with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah—then why have you come back?... Leave me! Get away, leave me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not leave her. He felt her whole body shaking and he was afraid of her; and as she bowed herself over their united hands he expected to feel her teeth fasten in his flesh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go, go!\" she insisted, \"I did not send for you! Since we must be brave, why did you come back? Why have you kissed me again? Ah, if you think you can play with me like this you are mistaken! If you think you can come here at night and write me humiliating letters in the day you are mistaken again! You came back to-night and you will come back to-morrow night and every night after that, until at last you drive me mad. But I won\u0027t have it, I won\u0027t have it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must be pure and brave, you say,\" she continued, and her face, grown old and tragic, became now pale as death; \"but you never said that before to-night. You fill me with horror! Go away, far away, and go at once, so that to-morrow I can wake up without the terror of expecting you and being humiliated like this again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O God, O God!\" he groaned, bending over her, but she repulsed him sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think you are speaking to a child?\" she burst out now: \"I am old, and it is you who have made me grow old in a few hours. The straight path of life! Oh, yes, it would be going straight if we continued this secret intrigue, wouldn\u0027t it? I should find myself a husband and you should marry me to him, and then we could go on seeing each other, you and I, and deceiving every one for the rest of our lives. Oh, you don\u0027t know me if that is your idea! Last night you said, \u0027Let us go away, we will get married and I will work.\u0027 Didn\u0027t you say that? Didn\u0027t you? But to-night you come and talk to me instead about God and sacrifice. So now there is an end of it all: we will part. But you, I say it again, you must leave the village this very night, I never wish to see you again. If to-morrow morning you go once more into our church to say Mass I shall go there too, and from the altar steps I shall say to the people: \u0027This is your saint, who works miracles by day and by night goes to unprotected girls to seduce them!\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He tried in vain to shut her mouth with his hand, and as she kept on crying aloud, \"Go, go!\" he seized her head and pressed it to his breast, glancing with alarm at the closed doors. And he remembered his mother\u0027s words and her voice, mysterious in the darkness: \"The old priest sat beside me and said, I will soon turn both you and your son out of the parish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Agnes, Agnes, you are mad!\" he groaned, his lips close to her ear, whilst she struggled fiercely to escape from him: \"Be calm, listen to me. Nothing is lost; don\u0027t you feel how I love you? A thousand times more than before! And I am not going away, I am going to stay near you, to save you, to offer up my soul to you as I shall offer it up to God in the hour of death. How can you know all that I have suffered between last night and now? I fled and I bore you with me: I fled like one who is on fire and who thinks by fleeing to escape the flames which only envelop him the more. Where have I not been to-day, what have I not done to keep myself from coming back to you? Yet here I am, Agnes, and how could I not be here?... Do you hear me? I shall not betray you, I shall not forget you, I do not wish to forget you! But, Agnes, we must keep ourselves unsoiled, we must keep our love for all eternity, we must unite it with all that is best in life, with renunciation, with death itself, that is to say, with God. Do you understand, Agnes? Yes, tell me that you understand!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She fought him back, as though she wanted to break in his breast with her head, till at last she freed herself from his embrace and sat rigid and upright, her beautiful hair twisted like ribbons round her stony face. With tight-shut lips and closed eyes, she seemed to have suddenly fallen into a deep sleep, wherein she dreamed of vengeance. And he was more afraid of her silence and immobility than of her frenzied words and excited gestures. He took her hands again in his, but now all four hands were dead to joy and to the clasp of love. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Agnes, can\u0027t you see that I am right? Come, be good; go to bed now and to-morrow a new life will begin for us all. We shall see each other just the same, always supposing you desire it: I will be your friend, your brother, and we shall be a mutual help and support. My life is yours, dispose of me as you wish. I shall be with you till the hour of death, and beyond death, for all eternity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This tone of prayer irritated her afresh. She twisted her hands slightly within his and opened her lips to speak. Then, as he set her free, she folded her hands in her lap and bowed her head and her face took on an expression of the deepest grief, but now a grief that was desperate and determined. \\n\\n \\n\\n He continued to gaze steadfastly at her, as one gazes at the dying, and his fear increased. He slid to his knees before her, he laid his head in her lap and kissed her hands; he cared nothing now if he were seen or heard, he knelt there at the feet of the woman and her sorrow as at the feet of the Mother of Sorrows herself. Never before had he felt so pure of evil thought, so dead to this earthly life; and yet he was afraid. \\n\\n \\n\\n Agnes sat motionless, with icy hands, insensible to those kisses of death. Then he got up and began to speak lies again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Agnes—that is right and I am very pleased. The trial has been won and you can rest in peace. I am going now, and to-morrow,\" he added in a whisper, bending nervously towards her, \"to-morrow morning you will come to Mass and together we will offer our sacrifice to God.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She opened her eyes and looked at him, then closed them again. She was as one wounded to death, whose eyes had opened wide with a last menace and appeal before they closed for ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will go away to-night, quite away, so that I shall never see you again,\" she said, pronouncing each word distinctly and decisively, and he realized that for the moment at least it was useless to oppose that blind force. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot go like that,\" he murmured: \"I must say Mass to-morrow morning and you will come and hear it, and afterwards I will go away, if necessary.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I shall come to-morrow morning and denounce you before all the congregation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you do that it will be a sign that it is God\u0027s will. But you won\u0027t do it, Agnes! You may hate me, but I leave you in peace. Good-bye.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Even yet he did not go. He stood quite still, looking down at her, at her soft and gleaming hair, the sweet hair he loved and through which so often his hands had strayed, and it awoke in him an infinite pity, for it seemed like the black bandage round a wounded head. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the last time he called her by her name: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Agnes! Is it possible that we can part like this?... Come,\" he added after a moment, \"give me your hand, get up and open the door for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She got up obediently, but she did not give him her hand; she went direct to the door through which she had entered the room, and there she stood still, waiting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can I do?\" he asked himself. And he knew very well that there was only one thing he could do to appease her: to fall at her feet again, to sin and be lost with her for ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n And that he would not do, never never more. He remained firm, there where he stood, and lowered his eyes that he might not meet her look, and when he raised them again she was no longer there; she had disappeared, swallowed up in the darkness of her silent house. \\n\\n \\n\\n The glass eyes of the stags\u0027 and deer\u0027s heads upon the walls looked down at him with mingled sadness and derision. And in that moment of suspense, alone in the big melancholy room, he realized the whole immensity of his wretchedness and his humiliation. He felt himself a thief, and worse than a thief, a guest who takes advantage of the solitude of the house that shelters him to rob it basely. He averted his eyes, for he could not meet even the glassy stare of the heads upon the wall: but he did not waver in his purpose for one moment, and even if the death-cry of the woman had suddenly filled the house with horror, he would not have repented having rejected her. \\n\\n \\n\\n He waited a few minutes longer, but nobody appeared. He had a confused idea that he was standing in the middle of a dead world of all his dreams and his mistakes, waiting till some one came and helped him to get away. But nobody came. So at last he pushed open the door that led into the orchard, traversed the path that ran beside the wall and went out by the little gate he knew so well. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1712/50444.html","bookId":1135,"book":{"id":1135,"title":"The Woman and the Priest","description":"简介： The Woman and the Priest [A] is an unusual book, both in its story and its setting in a remote Sardinian hill village, half civilized and superstitious.
