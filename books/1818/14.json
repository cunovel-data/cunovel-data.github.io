My parents’ sexual appetite for one another is astounding, and you never know where you’re going to find them.”\n “Oh my God. That is so awesome, but weird at the same time.” He laughed. “They must really love each other.”\n “They do, and they don’t have any problem letting people know it.”\n Jake drove to the end of the street where he parked the Range Rover, and we walked hand and hand down to the beach. The sand was illuminated by the light of the moon and the water was glistening. The night air was perfect. Jake sat down first and spread his legs, making room for me to sit up against him. He wrapped his arms around me as I lay back against his chest. We talked about our childhood and what we saw in our futures. Jake wanted at least three kids. I told him that two was a great number because you only have two hands. He laughed as he kissed me on the cheek. I stroked his arm with my finger as we talked, and I could feel him getting hard.\n “I’m sorry, Julia.”\n “For what?” I asked.\n “Umm ... I think you know.”\n Then it hit me; he was talking about his erection. “Oh, don’t worry about that. It’s okay.” I smiled as I tilted my head back and he kissed me on the lips. The kiss continued to get deeper, so I turned my body around and wrapped my legs around his waist as we made out under the moonlight. Suddenly, we heard talking and laughing. I instantly broke our kiss and turned my head.\n “What’s wrong?” Jake asked.\n “I swear that sounds like my parents,” I whispered.\n The laughing was getting louder and closer. I unwrapped my legs from Jake’s waist and sat next to him.\n “Are you sure?”\n “I’m telling you; that’s my mom’s laugh.”\n I could see the shadows of two people running towards us. The giggles were getting louder as they came closer. As I got up, they both fell on the sand, laughing and kissing each other.\n “Mom? Dad?” I said.\n “Huh?” my dad said.\n “Julia?” my mom asked.\n “Yes! I knew it was you guys. What are you doing?”\n “What are you doing here? We thought you were on a date?” my dad said.\n “I am on a date! What the hell are the two of you doing besides embarrassing the hell out of me?!”\n As I walked closer to them, my dad looked at my mom as he hovered over her, and they both started laughing. “I’m sorry, but we were going for a walk,” my dad spoke.\n “Are the two of you drunk?” I asked.\n “Maybe just a little.” My mom giggled.\n Jake got up and walked over to me. “Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Black.” He waved.\n “Oh, hi, Jake,” my dad said as he got off of my mom and helped her up.\n I wanted to die. I was so humiliated. “So what are the two of you doing?” my dad asked casually.\n “We were talking!” I said with gritted teeth.\n “Okay. Well, I guess we should go now.” My mom laughed. “We’re sorry to interrupt your talk.”\n My dad smacked my mom on the ass as she started to run back in the direction from which they came. She laughed as he started to chase her. I stood there, shaking my head in disgust at my parents’ behavior. Of all the times they had to take a walk on the beach, it had to be when I was on a date.\n “I’m so sorry,” I said as I turned and faced Jake.\n “Don’t be.” He smiled as he brushed my hair from my face. “I love your parents. They’re so cool. You have nothing to be sorry for.”\n He pulled me into a warm embrace and held me tightly. “Can I ask you something?”\n “Sure.”\n “Will you go out with me again?”\n I looked up at him and smiled. “I would love to go out with you again. But let’s go somewhere where we won’t run into my parents.”\n “You got it. I’ll go anywhere you want to.” He smiled as he brought his lips to mine.\n We talked for a couple of more hours, made out, and then he took me home. I had the best night of my life, and I couldn’t wait to see him again.\n Chapter 13\n I got up early because I couldn’t sleep. Jake and our date consumed my mind, plus we were texting back and forth pretty much all night. I went into the kitchen and made a pot of coffee. As I was preparing a hangover cocktail, my parents walked into the kitchen. Both of them looked like shit and really hung over.\n “Why are you up so early?” I said in a loud tone.\n “Why are you being so loud?” my dad whispered.\n “Good morning, sweetheart. We heard all this racket down here and we wanted to see what was going on,” my mom said.\n “Both of you sit! Now!” I commanded as I pointed at the table.\n They looked at each other, walked over to the table, and sat down. I set two glasses on the table and poured the cocktail into each one. I slid a glass over to my mom, then I slid a glass over to my dad.\n “DRINK.”\n “But,” my dad started.\n “No buts. Now drink it up.”\n My parents’ looked at each other as they picked up their glasses. “Gee, I can’t imagine where she gets her attitude from,” my dad said to my mom.\n She made a face at him as she held up her glass. “Cheers!”\n I walked over to the coffee pot and poured three cups of coffee as I began my speech.\n “We need to discuss the events of last night and how you embarrassed me. What were you thinking? Not only were you behaving like lovesick teenagers, you were drunk on top of it. Do you know how that looked in front of Jake? Do you have any idea how humiliated I was and how I had to apologize for your erratic behavior? Who’s the adult here? Because I know it’s neither one of you,” I said as I waved my finger at them.\n “Princess, don’t you think you’re overreacting just a little bit?” my dad said.\n “No, I don’t. Because I really like Jake a lot and you embarrassed me!”\n “Sweetheart,” my mom said as she got up from the table and walked over to me. I put up my finger.\n “Don’t, Mom,” I said as I looked away and tears started to form in my eyes.\n She tilted her head as she looked at me. “Okay. Your dad and I apologize for our actions last night and we’ll make sure it never happens again. But honestly, we didn’t know you’d be at the beach, and we really didn’t plan on walking that far. I guess we kind of lost track of where we were going.”\n My dad got up from his seat and walked over to me as my mom walked out of the kitchen. “I see what’s going on here,” he said. “You’re head over heels for this boy.”\n I wiped a tear that fell from my eye. “Come here, Princess,” my dad said as he wrapped his arms around me and kissed me on the head.\n “Dad, you don’t understand. The way I feel when I’m with him is like nothing I’ve ever felt before and I’m scared.”\n “You’re wrong, Julia, I do understand, and I know exactly how you’re feeling. That’s how your mom and I feel when we’re with each other. I’m not going to tell you that you’re crazy and it’s too soon because that feeling, the one you’re describing, came over me the first moment I saw your mom, standing in the kitchen and, when she smiled, that was it. That feeling has been with me ever since; even after all these years. When I look at your mom, I feel like I’m looking at her for the first time. I mean, I guess it doesn’t matter how old you are. When you meet your soul mate, you know it. Just be careful and take it slow. You’re only eighteen and far too young to be in a heavy relationship.”\n “Thanks, Dad.” I smiled.\n “You’re welcome, Princess. You know I’m here for you anytime you need me.”\n “What’s going on?” Collin asked as he walked into the kitchen.\n “Julia and I are just having a heart to heart.”\n “Oh. Don’t forget, Dad. We’re going to look at cars today.”\n My dad rolled his eyes and sighed. “I didn’t forget, Collin.”\n I walked upstairs and into my parents’ room. “Mom, can I come in?”\n “Sure, honey,” she said.\n “I’m sorry for giving you an attitude earlier. I just don’t want to ruin this with Jake. I know it’s only been one date, but—”\n “Your heart starts beating rapidly when you see him. Your stomach gets all tied up in knots and he’s the only person in the world that exists when you’re with him.” She smiled.\n “Yes.” I smiled back.\n “Come here, my sweet girl,” she said as she hugged me. “Take things slow. You have so much ahead of you.”\n “That’s what Dad said.”\n “Your dad is a wise man,” she said as she looked at me and then twisted her face. “Well, sometimes he’s wise.”\n I couldn’t help but laugh. “Thanks, Mom.”\n “I heard that, Elle,” my dad yelled from the hallway.\n As I walked out of the bedroom, I heard my phone beeping from my bedroom. I grabbed it from the dresser and saw a text message from Jake.\n “Good morning, beautiful. I was hoping you’d have coffee with me.”\n I smiled as I read his text and quickly responded.\n “Good morning. I would love to have coffee with you.”\n “Great. I’ll pick you up in thirty minutes. Is that okay?”\n “I’ll be ready and waiting.”\n I ran to my closet and quickly rummaged through all my clothes, trying to find something to wear. I pulled out a cream-colored lace sundress that I had forgotten about and still had the tags on it. I put it on and threw my hair up in a ponytail. As I put on the final touches of my makeup, I heard the doorbell ring.\n “I’ll get it,” I yelled as I ran down the stairs.\n I opened the door and there was Jake, standing there, holding two cups of coffee and looking sexy as hell.\n “Morning.” He smiled and I could swear the heavens opened up.\n “Morning.” I smiled back as I took a cup from him. “Come on in.”\n “You look great, Julia.”\n “So do you.”\n He held up a brown paper bag. “I brought us bagels, cream cheese, and some fresh fruit.”\n I took the bag from him and we walked to the kitchen. As I set the bag on the counter, Jake put his hands on my hips. He looked at me, smiled, and brushed his lips against mine, kissing me softly.\n “I dreamed of doing that all night,” he said.\n “I dreamed of you doing it all night.” I smiled.\n “Is that so?” he whispered as he kissed me again.\n “Yes,” I whispered back.\n “Good morning, Jake.” My dad smiled as he and my mom walked into the kitchen.\n Jake quickly removed his hands from my h*ps and took a step back. “Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Black.”\n My mom smiled at him and then at me. “Jake, you can call us Ellery and Connor. There’s no need to be so formal. Especially if you’re going to be dating our daughter.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/being-julia-forever-3-5/page-14.html","bookId":1818,"book":{"id":1818,"title":"Being Julia (Forever #3.5)","description":"Storyline: \n My name is Julia, and I’m the daughter of Connor and Ellery Black.
