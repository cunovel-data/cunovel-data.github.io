{"id":24697,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 28 Flowers for a Very Special Person","content":"Of course Miss Nogard knew all about Louis. The children\u0027s brains were buzzing about him. \n \n Louis likes Miss Nogard, thought Stephen. \n \n Louis is in love with Miss Nogard, thought Todd. \n \n Louis wants to marry Miss Nogard, thought Sharie. \n \n But even if she couldn\u0027t listen to their brains, she would have found out anyway. \"Louis, the yard teacher, is madly in love with you,\" said Jenny. \n 154 \n \"Oh, really?\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"He dreams about you every night,\" said Calvin. \n \n \"He thinks your eyes are like the moon,\" said Bebe. \n \n Miss Nogard smiled. \n \n \"Do you like him?\" asked Jenny. \n \n \"He\u0027s kind of cute,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"Ooooh,\" Bebe and Calvin said together. \n \n \"What about his mustache?\" asked Jenny. \"Do you like his mustache?\" \n \n Miss Nogard thought a moment. \"It would probably tickle if he kissed me.\" \n \n The children gasped as their mouths fell open. \n \n They returned to their desks and told everyone around them what Miss Nogard said. \n \n Miss Nogard smiled. She wondered just how she\u0027d break Louis\u0027s heart. \n \n Ever since Xavier broke her heart, she\u0027d become an expert at breaking other people\u0027s. She listened to men\u0027s brains and knew just what to say to make them fall in love with her. \n \n And then she knew just the right thing to say, at just the right moment, to shatter their hearts into a million pieces. Even the biggest and strongest man would cry like a baby. \n \n She was incapable of love. Her heart was clogged with bitterness and hate. And besides, she knew no one would ever love someone with three ears. \n \n For just a second she felt a pang of sadness. Because she really did think Louis was kind of cute. Like a puppy dog. \n \n She could almost feel the tickle of his mustache. \n \n \"Miss Nogard thinks you\u0027re cute,\" Jenny told Louis at recess. \n \n \"She\u0027s hot for you, Louis!\" said Mac. \n \n \"She wants to kiss you!\" said Bebe. \n \n \"C\u0027mon, let\u0027s play kickball,\" said Louis. \n \n They played kickball, but it was weird. Louis, who was probably the best kickball player ever, did terribly. He tripped over the ball when he tried to kick it. And when Terrence kicked a pop-up, Louis tried to catch it, but the ball bounced off his head. \n \n \"What\u0027s wrong with Louis?\" asked Ron. \"Is he sick or something?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Jenny. \"He\u0027s got a real bad disease. And it\u0027s spelled L-O-V-E.\" \n \n The next morning Louis came to school with a bunch of flowers in his hand. \n 156 \n Jenny saw him. \"Are those for Miss Nogard?\" she asked. \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis. \"I passed a field of wildflowers on the way to school. I thought I might give them to someone special.\" He winked at her. \n \n He headed toward the school building. Jenny followed. \n \n \"Oooh flowers!\" said Bebe. \n \n \"Are you going to give them to Miss Nogard?\" asked Calvin. \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" said Louis. \"I think she might have a pretty face, I mean vase.\" \n \n Calvin and Bebe followed along with Jenny. \n \n Louis entered the building. \n \n Miss Nogard was in the office. She was getting her mail from her box. Her back was to him. \n \n Louis froze. \n \n \"Go on, Louis,\" urged Jenny. \n \n But Louis just stood there. The flowers rattled in his shaky hand, and several petals fell to the floor. \n \n Mr. Kidswatter came out of his office. \"Good morning, Louis,\" he said. \"What have you got there?\" \n \n \"Uh, these are for you,\" said Louis. He thrust the flowers into Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s hand. \n \n \"They\u0027re lovely!\" said Mr. Kidswatter. Miss Nogard turned around. \"Those are very pretty, Mr. Kidswatter,\" she said, then headed up \n \n the stairs. \n \n Louis watched her go. \n \n \"No one\u0027s ever brought me flowers before,\" said Mr. Kidswatter. \"You may not believe this, Louis, but I don\u0027t have many friends.\" He put his hand on Louis\u0027s shoulder. \"You\u0027re like a son to me,\" he said. \n \n \"And you\u0027re a maggot-infested string bean,\" muttered Louis. \n \n \"What?\" asked Mr. K. \n \n \"I said, you\u0027re a magnificent human being.\" \n 159 \n \"Did anyone have any trouble with the homework?\" asked Miss Nogard. \n \n They all shook their heads. \n \n Ron shook his head too. Homework? he thought. What homework? \n \n \"Good,\" said Miss Nogard. \"Well, in that case, there won\u0027t be any homework tonight.\" \n \n Everyone cheered. \n \n \"Let\u0027s just quickly go over the answers,\" she said. \"Ron, what was your answer to question one?\" \n \n Ron\u0027s stomach flipped over. He fumbled with his notebook. \"Uh, just a second,\" he said. \n \n \"That\u0027s okay, we\u0027ll wait,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n Ron flipped through the pages. \"What question are we on?\" he asked. \n \n \"Question one,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"Um, I couldn\u0027t get that one,\" said Ron. \n \n \"Oh,\" said Miss Nogard. \"Well, that\u0027s okay, Ron. As long as you tried. Who knows the answer to question one?\" \n \n A handful of hands went up in the air. \n \n Seven lima beans, thought Jason. \n \n Seven lima beans, thought Rondi. \n \n Six cucumbers, thought Deedee. \n \n Seven lima beans, thought Stephen. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56947.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
