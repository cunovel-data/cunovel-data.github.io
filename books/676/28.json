His knees wobbled. \n \n The ball bounced off his face. \"Cool,\" he said as blood flowed out of his nose. \n \n \"That was a world\u0027s record, Louis!\" exclaimed Eric Ovens. \n \n Louis smiled proudly. He turned to look at Miss Nogard, but she had already gone inside, \n \n \"You like Miss Nogard, don\u0027t you?\" asked Bebe. \n \n \"She seems like a nice person,\" said Louis. \n \n \"She\u0027s pretty too,\" said Eric Bacon as he nudged Louis in the side. \n \n \"Well, she is kind of cute,\" Louis admitted. \n \n \"Oooooh,\" said Joy. \n \n \"But do you love her?\" asked Jenny. \n \n Everyone giggled. Louis\u0027s red face got even redder. \n \n \"You should ask her out on a date,\" said Eric Fry. \n \n \"No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a very good idea,\" said Louis. \n \n \"Why not?\" asked Eric Ovens. \"I think you two would make a real cute couple.\" \n \n \"Bring her flowers,\" said Dana. \n \n \"Buy her candy,\" said Maurecia. \n \n \"Tell her she\u0027s got eyes like the moon,\" said Bebe. \n \n \"Eyes like the moon?\" asked Louis. \n \n \"Girls love it when you tell them that,\" said Bebe. \n \n \"Forget that gushy stuff,\" said Eric Bacon. \"Just walk right up to her and say, \u0027Hey, baby! How about a date?\u0027 \" \n \n \"Just like that?\" asked Louis. \n \n \"This is what you do,\" said Terrence. \"You take her to a real scary movie. And then at the scary part, you put your arm around her.\" \n \n \"Ooooh,\" said Dana and Jenny. \n \n \"No, take her dancing,\" said Myron. \"And hold her real close.\" \n \n \"Ooooooh,\" said the three Erics. \n \n Louis laughed. \"You kids are crazy,\" he said. \n \n \"You\u0027re scared of her, aren\u0027t you?\" asked Eric Bacon. \n \n \"You shouldn\u0027t be scared,\" said Eric Ovens. \"You\u0027re bigger and stronger and faster than anyone on the playground.\" \n \n \"And you\u0027ve got the best mustache too,\" said Eric Fry. \n \n \"I\u0027m not afraid of her,\" Louis tried to explain. \"It\u0027s just-\" He looked up at the very tall school. \"Miss Nogard is way-high-up there, and I\u0027m way-down-low \n 152 \n here. You\u0027ll understand someday when you\u0027re older.\" \n \n He picked up the ball and threw it way high up. It hit somewhere between the eighteenth and twentieth story. \n \n And never came down. \n \n There was no nineteenth story. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56946.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
