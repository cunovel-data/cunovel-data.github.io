{"id":24678,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 9 Something Different about Mrs. Jewls","content":"The children returned from Christmas vacation. On each desk were two knitting needles and a hunk of yarn. \"Today we are going to learn how to knit,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She showed the class how it was done. \"See, you stick this needle through here, then wrap this around this like this, stick this through this, pull this like this, and then you stick this here. Any questions?\" Everyone stared at her. \"Good,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I want everybody to make socks. Okay, get started.\" Dameon looked at his knitting needles. He didn\u0027t have a clue. He looked back at Mrs. Jewls. Now, more than ever, he was sure she was somehow different. She was sitting at her desk, knitting and eating Baloneos. Dameon couldn\u0027t remember Mrs. Jewls ever eating a Baloneo before. A Baloneo was an Oreo cookie, except instead of the white part, there was a round hunk of baloney. Miss Mush invented them. \"Hey, Mac,\" whispered Dameon. \"Does Mrs. Jewls seem different to you?\" \"She\u0027s fat,\" said Mac. \"That\u0027s not a nice thing to say,\" said Dameon. \"I didn\u0027t say it to Mrs. Jewls,\" said Mac. \"I didn\u0027t go, \u0027Hey, Mrs. Jewls. You\u0027re fat!\u0027 \" Mrs. Jewls cleared her throat as she stood up. She walked around the room. \"Very nice, D.J.,\" she said. \"You\u0027re doing fine, Rondi.\" She stopped at Joe\u0027s desk. \"Oh, Joe!\" she gushed. \"Look, everybody, I want you to see Joe\u0027s sock!\" She held it up. \"Isn\u0027t it the most beautiful sock you ever saw?\" 48 It was a great sock. Everybody oohed and aahed. Joe was as surprised as anyone. He didn\u0027t know he knew how to make socks. But the boy was born to knit. Mrs. Jewls started to cry. \"I love this sock,\" she sobbed. \"Uh-oh,\" said Kathy. \"I think she\u0027s finally flipped out!\" \"I love you, Kathy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She looked around the room. \"I love all of you.\" She put her hand on Kathy\u0027s desk. \"I love this desk,\" she said. \"I love the blackboard. I love the clock on the wall.\" There was a ruler on the floor. Mrs. Jewls picked it up. \"I love this ruler,\" she declared. \"Hey, that\u0027s mine!\" said Dana. \"But, uh, that\u0027s okay, Mrs. Jewls. You can have it.\" \"I don\u0027t want your ruler, Dana,\" said Mrs. Jewls, handing it to her. \"You want my pair of scissors?\" offered Sharie. \"Don\u0027t give her anything sharp!\" warned Kathy. Mrs. Jewls wiped away her tears and smiled at the class. \"I\u0027m going to miss all of you very much,\" she said. \"Are you going away?\" asked Dameon. \"Yeah, to the loony bin,\" whispered Kathy. \"Are you sick?\" asked Eric Ovens. \"No, I\u0027m not sick,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"In fact, I\u0027m better than I\u0027ve ever been.\" She beamed. \"I\u0027m going to have a baby!\" Everyone gasped. Dameon couldn\u0027t believe it! He was so happy he jumped out of his seat and hugged Mrs. Jewls. She was soon surrounded by all her students, even Kathy, wanting to hug her. \"Today is my last day here,\" Mrs. Jewls told her students. \"My doctor doesn\u0027t want me walking up and down thirty flights of stairs every day, I wasn\u0027t even supposed to come today, but I just had to say good-bye.\" \"I thought you were getting fat,\" said Mac. \"But I didn\u0027t want to say anything.\" \"Thank you, Mac,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You are very considerate.\" \"Can I touch your stomach?\" asked Stephen. Mrs. Jewls laughed. \"Sure,\" she said. The children took turns touching her stomach. \"What are you going to name your baby?\" asked Allison. \"I don\u0027t know yet,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"What do you think?\" 50 \"Well, if she\u0027s a girl,\" said Allison, \"I think you should name her Rainbow Sunshine.\" \"That\u0027s a nice name,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"And if he\u0027s a boy?\" \"Bucket Head,\" said Allison. She didn\u0027t like boys. \"If he\u0027s a boy, you should name him Jet Rocket!\" said Joe. \"Jet Rocket Jewls,\" mused Mrs. Jewls. \"That has a nice ring to it. And what if she\u0027s a girl?\" \"Cootie Face,\" said Joe. Mrs, Jewls laughed. \"So let me get this straight,\" she said. \"If he\u0027s a boy, I\u0027ll name him Bucket Head.\" \"Right,\" said Allison and Rondi. \"And if she\u0027s a girl, I\u0027ll name her Cootie Face.\" \"Right,\" said Joe and John. Dameon laughed. He knew Mrs. Jewls was only joking. At least he hoped she was. Terrence placed his palm flat against Mrs. Jewls\u0027s stomach. \"Hey,\" he exclaimed. \"The dude kicked me!\" Suddenly Dameon felt very sad. He was going to miss her a lot! He wiped a tear from his eye. \"It\u0027s unfair!\" he shouted. \"We finally come back to Wayside School after being gone for so long. And now you\u0027re leaving us!\" \"I have to,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I know,\" whined Dameon. \"You have to make sure that you and your baby are healthy. But it still isn\u0027t fair!\" \"I think you\u0027ll like your substitute teacher,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I spoke to him over the vacation. He seems like a very nice man.\" \"A man?\" asked Dameon. \"Cool!\" They all thought it was pretty neat to have a man teacher. \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"His name is Mr. Gorf.\" \"Mr. Gorf,\" muttered Joy as she walked down the stairs to recess. \"Did she say Mr. Gorf?\" Maurecia nodded. Leslie caught up to them. \"Did she say Mr. Gorf?\" \"I think so,\" said Maurecia. \"Do you think-?\" Leslie asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Maurecia. \"I hope not,\" said Joy. Before Mrs. Jewls ever came to Wayside School, the children had a teacher named Mrs. Gorf. She wasn\u0027t very nice. Even Myron was worried. And Myron had never gotten in trouble in his whole life. \"Mr. Gorf might be a good teacher,\" said Eric Bacon. \"Just because he has the same last name as Mrs. Gorf doesn\u0027t mean he\u0027ll be horrible.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" said Eric Ovens. \"People with the same name can be different.\" \"I agree,\" said Eric Fry. \"There are probably lots of people named Gorf.\" Dameon said hopefully. \"I bet if you looked in the phone book, you\u0027d find ten whole pages of Gorfs.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m not coming to school tomorrow,\" said Joy. \"Me neither,\" Maurecia agreed. But the next morning their parents made them all go to school. Everyone arrived on time. Nobody dared to be late. But there was no teacher. Deedee sat down next to Myron. \"Is he here?\" she whispered. \"Sh!\" whispered Myron. He folded his hands on his desk and stared straight ahead.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56928.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
