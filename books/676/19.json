{"id":24687,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Miss Zarves taught the class on the nineteenth story. There is no nineteenth story. And there is no Miss Zarves. \n \n You already know all that. \n \n But how do you explain the cow in her classroom? \n \n Miss Zarves drew a triangle on the blackboard. \"A triangle has three sides,\" she said, then pointed to each side. \"One, two, three.\" She drew a square. \"A square has four sides. One, two, three, four.\" \n 104 \n She walked around the cow to the other side of the board. She drew a pentagon, a hexagon, and a perfect heptagon. \"A heptagon has seven sides,\" she said. \n \n Miss Zarves was very good at drawing shapes. When most people try to draw heptagons, there is always one side that sticks out funny. But Miss Zarves\u0027s heptagon was perfect. Every side was the same length, and every angle the same degree. \n \n It was a great talent. But nobody appreciated her. \n \n Nobody appreciated anything she did. It was like they didn\u0027t know she was there. \n \n She counted the sides on the heptagon. \"One, two, three, fo-\" \n \n \"MOOOOO,\" said the cow. \n \n Miss Zarves dropped her chalk. She glared at the cow. \"I hate this!\" she shouted. \n \n It was a brown cow with a white head. \n \n \"It\u0027s all right, Miss Zarves,\" said Virginia, her best student. \"I\u0027ll get the chalk for you.\" \n \n \"No,\" said Miss Zarves. \"Leave it where it is. The cow made me drop the chalk. The cow should pick it up.\" \n \n Her students gaped at her. \n \n \"I will not continue,\" said Miss Zarves, \"until that cow picks up the piece of chalk and draws an octagon on the board!\" She folded her arms across her chest, stared at the cow, and waited. \n \n Ray raised his hand. \n \n \"Yes, Ray,\" said Miss Zarves, arms still folded across her chest. \n \n \"Uh, cows can\u0027t pick up chalk,\" said Ray. \n \n Miss Zarves sighed. \"I know,\" she said. \"And I can\u0027t teach with a cow in my classroom!\" \n \n No one had ever seen Miss Zarves so upset. She usually had a pleasant disposition. \n \n \"It\u0027s okay, Miss Zarves,\" said Virginia. \"I don\u0027t mind the cow.\" \n \n \"You get used to it after a while,\" said Ray. \n \n \"What cow?\" asked Nick. \"Oh, that one! I forgot it was there.\" \n \n Miss Zarves smiled. She knew her students were trying to make her feel better. \n \n \"Other classrooms have goldfish or hamsters,\" said Virginia. \"It\u0027s really no different.\" \n \n \"No,\" said Miss Zarves. \"I won\u0027t have it! All my life I\u0027ve tried to be accommodating. I\u0027ve never been one to complain. And what has it gotten me? A cow!\" \n \n She shook her head. \"When I was a little girl, my friends never did what I wanted to do,\" she said. \"I always had to do whatever they wanted to do. \n 106 \n \"And my teacher never called on me in class. She always called on the kids who just shouted out without raising their hands, even though she said she wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027d say, \u0027I won\u0027t call on you if you don\u0027t raise your hand,\u0027 but then she always did anyway. But I was a good girl. I never shouted \n \n out \n \n \"And she always did things alphabetically, so I was always last if there was time for me at all. \n \n \"My parents were too busy for me. They were always dressing up and going out to fancy parties. I had to tuck myself in at night and wish myself \n \n sweet dreams.\" \n \n She took a tissue out of her sleeve and wiped \n \n a tear from her eye. \n \n \"Still, I always tried to keep a smile on my face. Well, not anymore! The days of walk-all-over-Miss-Zarves are finished!\" \n \n She threw open her classroom door. \"The squeaky wheel gets the grease!\" \n \n \"What are you going to do?\" asked Virginia. \n \n \"I\u0027m going out there!\" said Miss Zarves. \"And I\u0027m not coming back until I get some grease!\" \n \n She stepped outside. She decided she\u0027d go right to the top! So she headed down the stairs-to the principal\u0027s office. \n \n Joy and Maurecia were coming up the stairs. \n \n \"Todd is uglier than stupid,\" said Maurecia. \n \n \"You\u0027re crazy!\" said Joy. \"He\u0027s stupider than ugly.\" \n \n \"Oooh,\" teased Maurecia. \"I\u0027m going to tell Todd you think he\u0027s cute.\" \n \n Miss Zarves stepped in front of them. \"What are you children doing out of class?\" she asked. \n \n \"I didn\u0027t say he was cute,\" said Joy. \"He\u0027s just not as ugly as he is stupid.\" \n \n \"That means you think he\u0027s handsome,\" said Maurecia. \"Are you going to marry him?\" \n \n \"I asked you a question,\" said Miss Zarves. \n \n \"Ugh, gross!\" said Joy. \n \n \"I\u0027m a teacher,\" said Miss Zarves. \"That means you are supposed to listen to me.\" \n \n Joy and Maurecia walked right past her. \n \n Miss Zarves sighed, then continued down to Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s office. She took a deep breath to steady her nerves. She was about to knock but then changed her mind and just marched right in. \"Hey, Kidswatter, I want to talk to you!\" \n \n The principal was making a rubber-band ball. \n \n \"Do you hear me?\" asked Miss Zarves. \n \n He opened his desk drawer and looked for some more rubber bands. \n \n \"If you don\u0027t answer me right now,\" said Miss \n 108 \n Zarves, \"I\u0027m walking out the door and never coming back!\" \n \n Mr. K. pressed the buzzer on his phone. \"Miss Night, you need to order more rubber bands.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s it!\" said Miss Zarves. \"I\u0027m leaving. \n \n Good-bye. I quit!\" \n \n She walked out of the school and took a deep \n \n breath of fresh air. \n \n \"Please don\u0027t go, Miss Zarves,\" said a voice \n \n behind her. \n \n Startled, she turned around. \n \n \"We need you,\" said a bald-headed man. He was standing between two other men. Both had black mustaches, and one carried a black attach case. The bald man didn\u0027t have a mustache, \n \n \"Can you see me?\" she asked. \n \n \"Yes, of course,\" said the bald man. \"And we appreciate all your hard work.\" \n \n \"You do?\" \n \n All three nodded very sincerely. \n \n Miss Zarves was touched. \"I\u0027ve been teaching for thirty years,\" she said. \"And nobody has ever \n \n said that before.\" \n \n \"Well, it\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" said the \n \n bald man. \n \n \"I don\u0027t get any respect,\" said Miss Zarves. \"People treat me like I\u0027m a nobody.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" said the man with the attach case. \"You have to work long hours for very little money.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve never gotten paid,\" said Miss Zarves. \"And this is the first time in thirty years I\u0027ve ever left the building.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s not easy being a teacher,\" agreed the other man with a mustache. \n \n \"Even the book I\u0027m reading to my class,\" said Miss Zarves. \"The author makes fun of teachers!\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a tragedy,\" said the bald man. \n \n \"Then why do it?\" asked Miss Zarves. \"Why teach anymore? I could quit and nobody would care.\" \n \n \"The children need you,\" all three men said together. \n \n Miss Zarves sighed. \"I like to teach,\" she said. \"I really do. I love the children. It\u0027s just-\" \n \n She stopped and wiped her eyes. \n \n The man with the attach case opened it. He took out a handkerchief and handed it to Miss Zarves. \n \n \"Thank you,\" she said, blew her nose, then gave it back to him. \n \n He placed it back in his attach case. \n \n \"Can you at least get the cow out of my classroom?\" she asked. \n 110 \n The bald man smiled. \"I\u0027ll see what I can do,\" he said. \n \n Miss Zarves smiled as she slowly shook her head. Then she turned and walked back into the building. \n 111 \n Mr. Kidswatter\u0027s voice came over the loudspeaker. \"Good morning, boys and girls!\" \n \n There was the usual pause. \n \n \"I have a very important announcement,\" said Mr. K. \"Elevators have been installed in Wayside School!\" \n \n For a second, the kids on the thirtieth floor were too stunned to speak. Then everyone went crazy! \n \n \"Yahooooo!\" yelled Sharie. \n \n \"Hot diggity dog!\" shouted Dameon. \n 112 \n Everyone was yelling and jumping, \"Zippity doo dan!\" shouted Mrs. Drazil. Cheers could be heard coming from every classroom in Wayside School. The higher the classroom, the louder the cheers. \n \n \"Now, before you all rush out and use the elevators,\" said Mr. Kidswatter, \"I want to talk a little bit about elevator safety. \n \n \"I don\u0027t want the same kind of chaos that we have on the stairs every day. I don\u0027t know how many times I have to tell you. When you go up the stairs, stay to the right. When you come down the stairs, stay to the left. But still, everyone keeps bumping into each other. \n \n \"Well, that won\u0027t happen on the elevators. I have personally designed a special safety system. \n \n \"There are two elevators. One is blue. One is red. When you want to go up, you take the blue elevator. When you want to go down, you take the red elevator. It\u0027s that simple. It can\u0027t go wrong! The blue one only goes up. And the red one only goes down. \n \n \"By the way, has anyone seen my coffeepot?\" \n \n And so, at last, Wayside School got elevators. A blue one and a red one. They each worked perfectly one time-and never could be used again. \n 113 \n The good news: Jason got to leave school early. The bad news: He had a dentist appointment. \n \n \"I\u0027ll never ever eat candy again,\" he promised the Tooth God as he headed down the stairs. \"And I\u0027ll brush my teeth after every meal. I promise. Even if it\u0027s just a snack. I\u0027ll bring my toothbrush to school! Just please, please don\u0027t let her find any cavities.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve heard that song before,\" answered a voice inside his head. \"Every time you go to the dentist, it\u0027s the same thing. But then, a week later, \n 114 \n you\u0027re eating candy and forgetting to brush your \n \n teeth.\" \n \n \"This time I really, really mean it,\" Jason \n \n promised. \n \n \"Too late,\" said the voice. \n \n An hour later Jason was lying on his back in the dentist chair. \n \n \"Open,\" said the dentist \n \n His dentist was named Dr. Payne. She had long fingers and even longer fingernails. \n \n Jason opened his big mouth. He had the second biggest mouth in his class. \n \n \"Wider,\" said Dr. Payne. \n \n Jason stretched his mouth until his cheeks \n \n hurt. \n \n \"That\u0027s good,\" said Dr. Payne. \"Now just a little bit wider.\" \n \n The veins in Jason\u0027s neck bulged out as he stretched his mouth even wider. His eyes watered. His throat was dry. \n \n \"Okay, just hold it like that,\" said Dr. Payne, She turned on the sucking machine and put a tube in Jason\u0027s mouth. \n \n The machine made a gagging noise as it sucked out his last drop of moisture. \n \n As Dr. Payne poked around at his teeth \n \n she said \"Tsk, tsk\" and \"Oh, my!\" several times. \n \n \"So how do you like school?\" she asked. \n \n \"Aghaa,\" said Jason. \n \n \"What grade are you in?\" \n \n \"Aakhalak,\" said Jason. \n \n \"Well, just remember,\" said Dr. Payne. \"It\u0027s very important to always listen to your teachers and do whatever they say.\" \n \n She poked a tooth with a long, pointed dentist tool. \n \n \"AAAAHhhhhhhhh!\" Jason screamed in agony. \n \n \"Did that hurt?\" asked Dr. Payne. \n \n Jason shook his head. If he told her it hurt, she might think it was a cavity. If she couldn\u0027t find it herself, he certainly wasn\u0027t going to tell her about it. \n \n \"Are you sure?\" asked Dr. Payne. She poked the same spot \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56937.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
