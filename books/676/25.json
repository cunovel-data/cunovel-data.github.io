Miss Nogard looked from one to another. Eenie . . . meenie . . . minie . . . Maurecia! she thought. Maurecia was stamping a stamp. \"Maurecia,\" said Miss Nogard. \"Will you come here, please?\" Maurecia walked to the front of the room. \"Yes?\" she said cheerfully. \"Don\u0027t \u0027yes\u0027 me, young lady,\" said Miss Nogard. \"You know what you did.\" Maurecia looked back at her teacher. What did I do? she wondered. Miss Nogard waited patiently. Everyone was guilty of something. I didn\u0027t do anything, did I? thought Maurecia. I\u0027ve been good, I think. Unless she found out about that dictionary page I accidentally tore. No, she couldn\u0027t know about that! It happened before she even got here. And I don\u0027t think anybody saw me do it. \"I didn\u0027t do anything,\" she said. I probably should have told Mrs. Jewls about it, she realized, but it wasn\u0027t even my fault! I was looking up how to spell \u0027journey\u0027 for my journal, and the page just ripped all by itself. \"It is one thing to do something wrong, Maurecia,\" said Miss Nogard. \"But when you do, you should admit to it. We all make mistakes. But when you lie about it, you make matters much worse for yourself.\" Maurecia nodded as she tried to figure out what to do. If Miss Nogard knew she tore the dictionary page, then of course she should admit to 138 it But there was no way Miss Nogard could know! It was impossible. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean,\" she said innocently. \"I didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\" She smiled at her teacher.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56943.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
