{"id":24681,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"Mr. Gorf\u0027s nose flared. \n \n His right nostril flared to the right. His left nostril flared to the left. And the hole in the middle seemed to get larger. \n \n Mac coughed. He tried to speak, but no words came out. \n \n \"Thank you, Mac,\" said Mr. Gorf. \"Anyone else?\" \n \n Deedee raised her hand. \n \n \"Yes, young lady,\" said Mr. Gorf. \n \n Deedee giggled. She liked the way he said \"young lady.\" \"My name is Deedee,\" she said. Her voice was small, but full of energy, like a superball. \"I like soccer and Ninja Turtles. My favorite-\" \n \n Mr. Gorf\u0027s nose flared. \n \n Deedee lost her voice too. \n \n \"Who\u0027s next?\" asked Mr. Gorf. \"Yes, the girl in the polka-dot shirt.\" \n \n \"My name\u0027s Maurecia,\" said Maurecia. \"I have two brothers and one sister.\" \n \n Maurecia\u0027s voice was like a pineapple milkshake. \n \n Mr. Gorf sucked it up through his nose. \n \n \"Hey, what\u0027s going-,\" said Todd. \n \n Todd was silent. \n \n \"Look at his nose!\" shouted Eric Bacon. \"It has-\" \n \n Eric Bacon had nothing else to say. \"Nobody say anyth-,\" Jenny tried to warn. Her voice disappeared up Mr. Gorf\u0027s nose. Soon the class was quiet \n \n Mr. Gorf\u0027s middle nostril had snorted all of their voices. \n \n Except for Allison. She remained silent. She knew she\u0027d only get one chance to speak, and she had to wait for just the right moment. \n \n \"What good little boys and girls you are,\" said Mr. Gorf. \"So nice and quiet.\" He laughed. \n \n \"Of course, this isn\u0027t my real voice,\" he said. \"I stole this voice from a gentleman I met in Scotland.\" \n \n He touched the tip of his nose. \n \n \"This is my voice!\" he squawked. \n \n If a donkey could talk, and if the donkey had a sore throat, and if it spoke with a French accent-that was what Mr. Gorf\u0027s voice sounded like. \n \n But what he said next was even more horrible than his voice. \n \n \"Mrs. Gorf was my mommy.\" \n \n The children sat frozen in their chairs, too scared to move. \n \n Suddenly there was a knock on the door. \n \n Mr. Gorf touched his nose. \"Who is it?\" he \n 62 \n asked in the pleasant voice he stole from the Scottish gentleman. \n \n \"Miss Mush,\" said Miss Mush from the other side of the door. \"I just came up to say hello and welcome you to Wayside School.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s very nice of you, Miss Mush,\" said Mr. Gorf. \"But we\u0027re very busy right now. Maybe we can get together for tea and crumpets sometime.\" \n \n Miss Mush giggled. \"That sounds lovely,\" she said. \"By the way, Mr. Gorf, are you married?\" \n \n \"No, I\u0027m single,\" said Mr. Gorf. \n \n \"So am I,\" said Miss Mush. \n \n \"Miss Mush!\" shouted Allison. \"Help! Mr. Gorf is taking-\" \n \n Mr. Gorf\u0027s nose flared. \n \n \"Did you say something, Allison?\" asked Miss Mush. \n \n Mr. Gorf touched his nose. Then he spoke, this time using Allison\u0027s voice. \"Mr. Gorf is taking us on a field trip next week. But he might need help. Do you want to come with us?\" \n \n \"Maybe,\" said Miss Mush. \"Thank you, Allison.\" \n \n \"Oh, don\u0027t thank me,\" said Allison\u0027s voice. \"Thank Mr. Gorf. He\u0027s the best teacher in the whole world!\" \n \n \"I\u0027m glad,\" said Miss Mush. \"He sounds very charming.\" \n \n \"And so do you,\" said Mr. Gorf, speaking like the gentleman from Scotland. He touched his nose. \n \n \"See you later, Miss Mush,\" said the voice of Eric Ovens. \n \n \"Take care,\" said Calvin\u0027s voice. \n \n \"Have a nice day,\" said Kathy\u0027s voice. \n 65 \n Mr. Gorf locked the door. \"I don\u0027t want any more interruptions,\" he said. \n \n Very quietly. Leslie slipped a piece of paper out of her desk. Then she felt around for a pencil. \n \n Mr. Gorf returned to the teacher\u0027s desk. He opened the top drawer and took out the class list. It had the names of all the children in the class, their parents\u0027 names, and their parents\u0027 home and work phone numbers. \n \n \"Let\u0027s play a game!\" he said, speaking in his own, normal, French-donkey-with-a-sore-throat voice. \"The name of the game is Who Am I Now?\" \n \n Leslie found a pencil. She held the piece of paper on her lap, where Mr. Gorf couldn\u0027t see it, and wrote HELP in big letters. She had to get it to Louis, the yard teacher. \n \n Mr. Gorf touched the tip of his nose. \"Who am I now?\" he asked. \n \n It was a girl\u0027s voice, soft and warm, with just a little bit of a giggle in it. \n \n Everyone looked at Rondi. \n \n \"Rondi,\" said Mr. Gorf. He opened his briefcase and removed a portable phone. He dialed Rondi\u0027s home number. \n \n \"Hello, Mommy,\" Mr. Gorf said into the phone, using Rondi\u0027s voice. \"No, nothing\u0027s wrong. I just called to say I hate you! You\u0027re the worst mommy in the whole world. You\u0027re ugly and you smell bad! It\u0027s not fair! Out of all the mommies in the world, I got stuck with you!\" \n \n He hung up the phone. \n \n Rondi sat crying in her chair. \n \n Mr. Gorf touched his nose. \"Isn\u0027t this a good game?\" he asked, sounding very much like a sick French donkey. \"Rondi is crying. And at home, her mother is crying too.\" He laughed. \"Too bad you won\u0027t ever be able to tell her you\u0027re sorry, Rondi.\" \n 66 \n Leslie carefully folded the piece of paper into a paper airplane. There was one open window, next to Sharie\u0027s desk. \n \n Mr. Gorf touched his nose. \"Who am I now?\" he asked. \n \n Everyone tried not to look at Joe. \n \n Mr. Gorf called Joe\u0027s mother at work. \"Hello, Mommy,\" he said. \"I hate you! I wish you\u0027d go away forever! Then maybe Daddy will marry somebody good this time.\" \n \n Leslie knew she\u0027d only have one chance. It would take a perfect throw. She tossed the paper airplane toward the window. \n \n Mr. Gorf saw it. \"Hey!\" he shouted. \n \n The airplane sailed closer . . . closer . . . but then at the last second it made a sudden turn, hit the wall, and landed on the floor. \n \n Mr. Gorf laughed. He picked up the airplane and unfolded it \"Help,\" he sneered. \"No one can help you now! You took my mommy away from me. And I\u0027m going to take your mommies away from you!\" \n \n He touched his nose. \n \n \"Who am I now?\" he asked. \n \n It was Leslie\u0027s voice. \n \n He started to dial her home phone number but was interrupted by a knock on the door. \n \n \"Oh, Mr. Gorf!\" sang Miss Mush. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Mr. Gorf, still in Leslie\u0027s voice. He touched his nose and cleared his throat \"I mean, yes?\" This time he sounded like a donkey with tonsillitis. He touched his nose again. \"Yes?\" he asked in the pleasant voice he took from the Scottish gentleman. \n \n \"It\u0027s me again,\" said Miss Mush. Miss Mush\u0027s voice was like two boots sloshing through mud. \"I baked you a pie, Mr. Gorf. To welcome you to Wayside School.\" \n \n Mr. Gorf sighed. \"You are very kind, Miss Mush,\" he said. \"But we are all quite busy at the moment. Perhaps another-\" \n \n \"It\u0027s best to eat it while it\u0027s still warm,\" said Miss Mush. \"You probably don\u0027t get fresh pies very often. Being a bachelor and all.\" \n \n \"I really hate to disturb the class,\" said Mr. Gorf. \"I\u0027ll tell you what. \"I\u0027ll just come outside a moment, and you can hand it to me.\" \n \n He glared at the class, daring them to move. Then he opened the door. \n \n \"I hope you like pepper pie,\" said Miss Mush. She smashed it in his face. \n \n Mr. Gorf turned around. His face was covered with a thick pepper cream. He sneezed. \n \n Calvin laughed. \n 68 \n \"Hey, my voice is back!\" said Calvin. \"Wait a second. This isn\u0027t my voice. I sound like Bebe!\" \n \n Mr. Gorf sneezed again. \n \n \"I can talk!\" shouted Jenny. \"But who am I?\" \n \n Mr. Gorf sneezed. \n \n \"You\u0027re Maurecia!\" said Jason. Jason sounded like the gentleman from Scotland. \n \n Mr. Gorf kept sneezing. \n \n \"Who might I be, sonny?\" Paul cackled. He sounded like somebody\u0027s grandmother. \n \n Todd barked. \n \n \"AAAACHOOocmmr \n \n Mr. Gorf sneezed so hard his nose flew off his face. He screamed like a donkey, then ran noseless out of the room. \n \n \"Oh, gross!\" said Jason. \"Now I sound like Allison.\" \n \n Bebe said something in Italian. \n \n \"Nobody panic,\" said Miss Mush. \"Your voices are bouncing around, trying to find where they belong. It might take a while, but soon you will be back to normal.\" \n \n \"How do you know?\" asked Leslie, although she sounded like Paul. \"And how\u0027d you know to smash a pepper pie in Mr. Gorf\u0027s face?\" \n \n \"I wasn\u0027t exactly sure,\" explained Miss Mush. \"But when I came up the first time, I heard Kathy say \u0027Have a nice day.\u0027 So, either Kathy had decided to be nice to me, or Mr. Gorf was a mean teacher who sucked children\u0027s voices up his nose.\" She shrugged. \"I just didn\u0027t think Kathy would be nice.\" \n \n \"Maybe if you learned to brush your teeth,\" muttered Kathy. \n \n Mr. Gorf\u0027s nose lay on the floor. Miss Mush picked it up and put it in her apron pocket. \"It will go good in spaghetti sauce,\" she said. \n \n Soon all the children had their real voices back. Rondi and Joe called their mothers on Mr. Gorf\u0027s portable phone and told them they loved them. \n \n While far away, in a small village in Scotland, a man who hadn\u0027t spoken for twenty years turned to his wife and said, \"Top of the morning to you, Tilly.\" \n 71 \n The new teacher entered the classroom carrying a big blue notebook stuffed with papers. She had white hair and wore glasses. She was a lot older than anyone else in the class. \n \n She took a big breath. \"My, it\u0027s tiring walking up all those stairs, isn\u0027t it?\" she said. \n \n Nobody said anything. They just stared at her. \n \n She set her notebook on the teacher\u0027s desk. \"My name is Mrs. Drazil,\" she said. \"And I\u0027m not from Brazil.\" She smiled at her little joke. \n \n Nobody else smiled. After Mrs. and Mr. Gorf, they didn\u0027t trust teachers. \n \n Drazil, thought Deedee. Where have I heard that name before? \n \n \"Where are you from?\" asked Leslie. \n \n \"Actually, I was born not too far from here,\" said Mrs. Drazil. \n \n \"Then why\u0027d you say you came from Brazil?\" asked Benjamin. \n \n \"No, I said I wasn\u0027t from Brazil,\" said Mrs. Drazil. \n \n \"Have you ever been to Brazil?\" asked Eric Fry. \n \n \"No,\" explained Mrs. Drazil. \"It was just a little joke. Brazil rhymes with Drazil. I thought it might help you remember my name.\" \n \n Terrence laughed. \"Drazil-Brazil!\" he shouted. \"That\u0027s funny!\" \n \n Several other kids laughed too. \n \n But not Deedee. She had heard of Mrs. Drazil somewhere. She was sure of it. And whatever she had heard, she was sure it wasn\u0027t good. \n \n \"What\u0027s a Brazil?\" asked Eric Ovens. \n \n \"Brazil is the largest country in South America,\" said Mrs. Drazil. \n \n \"Oh,\" said Eric Ovens. \"I thought it was one of those things that, you know, women wear, you know, on their bosom.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56931.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
