Rondi loved anything purple. \"You can\u0027t do purple,\" said Allison. \"I\u0027m doing it.\" \"So?\" said Rondi. \"Mrs. Jewls didn\u0027t say two people couldn\u0027t do the same color.\" \"But purple is my favorite color in the world,\" said Allison. Rondi and Allison were best friends, but Allison always got her way. Rondi switched to blue. Joe raised his hand. \"I don\u0027t know what rhymes with red,\" he said. Mrs. Jewls gave him a few suggestions. \"Bed, led, wed. Think of words that end in \u0027e-d.\u0027 \" \"Oh, I get it!\" said Joe. He set to work. Rondi tried to think of words that rhymed with blue. She raised her hand. \"Mrs. Jewls!\" she said. \"I chose blue. Can I rhyme that with zoo?\" \"Yes, that would be a good rhyme,\" agreed Mrs. Jewls. \"How about glue?\" asked Rondi. \"Yes, that rhymes too,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Oh, I know!\" said Rondi. \"How about stew?\" \"Just pick one and get started,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Rondi smiled. \"This is fun,\" she told Allison. \"There are lots of words that rhyme with blue.\" Allison grunted. Nothing rhymed with purple. In her mind, Allison had gone through every letter of the alphabet: aurple, burple, curple, durple... all the way to zurple. But after making a big stink over it with Rondi, she couldn\u0027t switch colors now. Rondi was just about to start her poem when she got an even better idea: Love That\u0027s True. \"Poets are always writing about Love That\u0027s True, aren\u0027t they, Mrs. Jewls?\" \"Sometimes,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Rondi smiled. Except she really didn\u0027t know much about true love. \"Morning dew!\" she said. \"Poets write about morning dew too, don\u0027t they, Mrs. Jewls?\" \"I believe so,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Dana walked to Mrs. Jewls\u0027s desk. \"I can\u0027t think of anything that rhymes with pink,\" she complained. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll think of something,\" said Mrs. Jewls. She winked at her. \"I can\u0027t think,\" said Dana. \"My mind\u0027s on the blink. I\u0027m no good at poetry. I stink!\" \"Just keep trying,\" said Mrs. Jewls. Dana returned to her seat. She started to put her name on her paper, but her pen wouldn\u0027t write. \"Great!\" she complained. \"Now my pen\u0027s out of ink!\" \"Hey, Dana,\" whispered John. \"Do you want to borrow my pen?\" \"Sure,\" said Dana. \"Too bad, I\u0027m using it,\" said John. Then he and Joe cracked up. Meanwhile, Allison was going through the alphabet for the tenth time. . . . Murple, nurple, ourple, qurple, . . . she thought. \"My left shoe!\" exclaimed Rondi. \"You better choose something, Rondi, and get started,\" advised Mrs. Jewls. \"I got it!\" said Rondi. \"A Bird That Flew!\" At the end of the day, the children turned in their poems. Yellow by Kathy I don\u0027t feel too well, oh I don\u0027t know who to tell, oh I\u0027m sick and I smell, oh My barf is yellow Green by Stephen The swimming pool has lots of chlorine. It turned my hair green. Brown by Joy At the circus I saw a clown. On his face was a great big frown. His sad eyes were big and brown. Red by Joe The fire truck is red! It hurried! The siren wailed! The house burned! The firemen saved The baby who screamed. Pink by Dana My favorite color is pink. John is a ratfink! 16 Purple by Allison The baby won\u0027t stop crying. His face is turning purple. Will anything make him feel better? I bet a burp\u0027ll. Blue by Rondi That was as far as she got. 17 Actuall","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56922.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
