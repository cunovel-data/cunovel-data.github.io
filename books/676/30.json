He flipped through his papers. \"What question are we on?\" he asked. \n \n \"Question two,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"Uh, I couldn\u0027t get that one either,\" said Ron. \n 160 \n Miss Nogard looked at him a moment. \"Okay, who knows the answer to question two?\" \n \n Abraham Lincoln\u0027s hat, thought Todd. \n \n Abraham Lincoln\u0027s hat, thought Joy. \n \n Abraham Lincoln\u0027s hat, thought Bebe. \n \n George Washington\u0027s left shoe, thought Calvin. \n \n \"Yes, Calvin,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"George Washington\u0027s left shoe!\" said Calvin. \n \n \"No, I\u0027m sorry,\" said Miss Nogard. \"The answer was Abraham Lincoln\u0027s hat.\" \n \n I knew it! thought Todd. \n \n Calvin\u0027s stupid, thought Joy. \n \n \"Ron, did you get the answer to number three?\" asked Miss Nogard. \n \n Ron shook his sorry little head. He wished he had just told her the truth, but now it was too late. \n \n \"Anyone?\" asked Miss Nogard. \n \n Chairs and bears, thought Benjamin. \n \n Coats and goats, thought D. J. \n \n Chairs and bears, thought Mac. \n \n Chairs and bears, thought Deedee. \n \n Miss Nogard called on D. J. \n \n \"Coats and goats?\" he said hopefully. \n \n \"No, chairs and bears,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n What an idiot! thought Benjamin. \n \n \"Question four,\" said Miss Nogard. \"Ron?\" \n \n .. And so it went. Miss Nogard went through the entire homework assignment, and nobody gave a correct answer. \n \n \"I\u0027m very disappointed,\" she said when they were finished. \"You obviously didn\u0027t understand it. So I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m going to have to assign homework tonight after all.\" \n \n Everyone groaned. \n \n \"I don\u0027t like it any better than you do,\" said Miss Nogard. \"But it\u0027s for your own good.\" \n \n She assigned three pages of homework, plus they had to do yesterday\u0027s homework over again as well. \n \n But nobody blamed Miss Nogard. They liked her! She didn\u0027t even want to give homework. \n \n They blamed each other. \n \n It\u0027s not fair! thought Benjamin. I only missed one problem. But I have to do extra homework because everyone else is so stupid! \n \n It was the same all around the room. Nobody missed more than two problems. Everyone thought everyone else was stupid! \n \n Miss Nogard smiled as she listened to their thoughts. \n \n I hate Joe! thought John. \n \n I hate Calvin! thought Bebe. \n \n I hate Joy! thought Maurecia, \n \n I hate Allison! thought Rondi. \n \n And everyone hated Ron. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56948.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
