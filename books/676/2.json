{"id":24670,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"Louis used to be the yard teacher at Wayside School. He passed out the balls and played with the kids at recess and lunch. When the school closed, the children were sent to other schools. Horrible schools. No two kids were sent to the same school. Louis was afraid he\u0027d cry if he talked to them. But he worked hard. For two hundred and forty-two days, he pushed and pulled, shoveled and mopped. He never left the building. At night he slept on the couch in the teachers\u0027 lounge on the twelfth floor. Some days it seemed hopeless. The worst part was the smell. He often had to run and stick his head out a window to get a breath of fresh air. But whenever he felt like quitting, he thought about those poor kids, stuck in those horrible schools, and he just worked harder. And at last, two hundred and forty-three days later, the school was ready to open. Well, almost ready. There was one little problem. Suddenly, from somewhere inside the building, or maybe just inside his head, Louis heard a loud \"moo.\" He put his hands over his ears and said, \"I don\u0027t hear it, I don\u0027t hear it, I don\u0027t hear it\" until the mooing stopped. He had scrubbed and polished every inch of Wayside School. There were no cows anywhere. He was sure of it! Still, every once in a while, he heard something go \"moo.\" Or at least he thought he did. He took the sign off the door. But before you enter, you should know something about Wayside School. Wayside School is a thirty-story building with one room on each floor, except there is no nineteenth story. Mrs. Jewls teaches the class on the thirtieth story. Miss Zarves teaches the class on the nineteenth story. There is no Miss Zarves. Understand? Good; explain it to me. \"Louis!\" someone shouted. He turned to see a red and blue overcoat 4 running toward him. \"Hi, Sharie!\" he said. He couldn\u0027t see her face, but he knew she had to be somewhere inside the coat. Sharie jumped into his arms. \"I bet you\u0027re glad to be back,\" said Louis. \"You bet!\" said Sharie. \"Now I can finally get some sleep!\" All around the playground, old friends were getting back together. \"Hi, old pal!\" said John. \"Hey, good buddy,\" said Joe. \"Bebe!\" yelled Calvin from one side of the playground. \"Calvin!\" shouted Bebe from the other. They ran and smashed into each other. \"Hi, Eric, good to see you,\" said Eric. \"Hey, good to see you too,\" said Eric. \"Oh, look. There\u0027s Eric!\" \"Hi, Eric! Hi, Eric!\" \"Hi, Eric.\" \"Hi, Eric.\" Even Kathy said hello to everybody. \"Hey, Big Ears!\" she said to Myron as she slapped him on the back. \"What\u0027s happ\u0027nin\u0027, Smelly?\" she asked Dameon. \"You didn\u0027t take a bath for two hundred and forty-three days, did you? Hi, Allison. Did you get uglier while you were away, or were you always this ugly and I just forgot?\" \"That\u0027s a nice sweater, Kathy,\" said Allison, who always tried to say something nice. Kathy moved on to Terrence. \"I\u0027m sure glad to see you, Terrence!\" she said. \"You are?\" asked Terrence. \"Yes,\" said Kathy. \"I thought you\u0027d be in jail by now.\" Todd came running across the playground. \"Hi, Todd!\" shouted Sharie, right in Louis\u0027s ear. Todd kept running. \"Hey, Todd!\" called Jason. \"Good to see you!\" \"Hi, Todd!\" called Myron and D. J. But Todd didn\u0027t answer. He just kept running until he reached the school building. Then he kissed Wayside School. Out of all the schools, Todd had been sent to the very worst one. It was awful! The first thing he had to do every morning was- Wait a second. I don\u0027t have to tell you. You already know. Todd was sent to your school.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56920.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
