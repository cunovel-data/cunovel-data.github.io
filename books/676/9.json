Inside the window \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls was stalling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are our parents all liars?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it all just a trick \\n\\n \\n\\n To make us be good For fear of St. Nick?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell us the truth; \\n\\n \\n\\n Don\u0027t try to fake it. Is there a Santa? \\n\\n \\n\\n Let us know; we can take it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Jewls cleared her throat, Then she cleared it again. \\n\\n \\n\\n She put down her pencil. She picked up her pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, look!\" shouted Leslie. \"Look there! Who\u0027s that? Someone is coming in Through the goozack!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sure enough, the door opened. \\n\\n \\n\\n It had to open quite wide! As a strange-looking stranger \\n\\n \\n\\n Stepped sideways inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n He wore a red suit \\n\\n \\n\\n And had a white, fluffy beard. And even for Wayside \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked pretty weird! \\n\\n \\n\\n His fat belly shook Like a bowl full of Jell-O. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no doubt about it. They knew that fellow! \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Louis, the yard teacher. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you doing in that stupid suit Louis?\" asked Sharie. \"Aren\u0027t you hot?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why are you wearing a fake beard?\" asked Todd. \\n\\n 44 \\n\\n \"Is that a pillow under your jacket?\" asked Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy was delighted. \"See!\" she said. \"That proves there\u0027s no Santa Claus! If there was, Louis wouldn\u0027t have to dress up like a fool and pretend to be him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not Louis,\" said Louis. \"I\u0027m Santa Claus. Ho! Ho-\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re lying to us, Louis,\" said John. \"Everyone is always lying to us. Kathy\u0027s right. Christmas is nothing but a dirty, stinking lie!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was just trying to bring a little holiday cheer,\" said Louis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go home, Jerome,\" said Terrence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, that\u0027s no way to talk to Louis,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"Louis is one of Santa\u0027s special helpers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Really, Louis?\" asked Deedee. \\n\\n \\n\\n Louis looked at Mrs. Jewls. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n The children were all very impressed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you ever met him?\" demanded Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, no, not exactly,\" Louis admitted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See!\" said Kathy. \"It\u0027s just another lie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to meet Santa to be one of his special helpers,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then how do you know what he wants you to do?\" asked John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s easy,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"You just have to be nice to other people. Whenever you give someone a present or sing a holiday song, you\u0027re helping Santa Claus. To me, that\u0027s what Christmas is all about. Helping Santa Claus!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I be one of his helpers?\" asked Dameon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, everybody,\" shouted Dameon. \"I\u0027m one of Santa\u0027s helpers!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me too,\" said Allison. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There must be a Santa Claus!\" cheered Stephen. \"Because it feels so good to help him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So the children all helped Santa, \\n\\n \\n\\n In every way they could, By singing songs and giving gifts \\n\\n \\n\\n And just by being good. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But there is no Santa Claus!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kathy continued to yelp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if that\u0027s the case,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He must really need our help.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56927.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
