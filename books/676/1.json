{"id":24669,"no":1,"title":"Synopsis","content":"All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!). Now the kids are back and the fun begins again on every floor. Miss Mush has prepared a special lunch of baked liver in purple sauce, and it\u0027s Pet Day on the 30th floor-with dogs and cats and frogs and skunks and pigs, and an orange named Fido causing a terrible commotion. In Mrs. Drazil\u0027s class, they\u0027re throwing a coffeepot, a sack of potatoes, a pencil sharpener, and a light bulb out the window to see which hits the ground first. But the big surprise is Mrs. Jewls is expecting a baby-but one named Cootie Face or Bucket Head-\"and a substitute teacher is coming-and everyone knows what that means... 1 For two hundred and forty-three days, a lonely sign hung on the front of the old school building. On some days a child would come, look at the sign, then sadly walk away. Or else a child would come, look at the sign, stand on her head, then sadly walk away. 2 Louis watched them come and go. But he never said \"Hi!\" to them. He hid when they came. It was his job to repair the school.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56919.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
