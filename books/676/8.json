There is a Santa Claus. I know there is!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ho, ho, ho,\" laughed Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kathy is just saying that because she never gets any presents,\" said Jason. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All she ever gets is a lump of coal!\" said Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wrong!\" said Kathy. \"I get lots of presents. My parents buy them for me. They have lots of money. They buy me anything I want.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She bit off the head of a reindeer cookie. \"The \\n\\n 40 \\n\\n only thing that matters is how rich your parents are. If they have lots of money, then you\u0027ll get lots of good presents. If they\u0027re poor, then you\u0027ll just get a few crummy presents.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Everyone tried to argue with her, but Kathy just asked them all the old questions, like \"How does a fat man fit down a skinny chimney?\" or \"How could he visit everyone\u0027s house in the whole world in one night?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And of course nobody knew the answers. Nobody ever has. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only Santa knows the answers to those questions,\" said Rondi. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you even like Christmas?\" asked Stephen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I get lots of presents, And I don\u0027t have to work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then she stuck out her tongue and called Stephen a jerk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Poor Stephen sputtered As his face turned quite blue, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t believe in Santa, He won\u0027t believe in you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Kathy just yelped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know that it\u0027s true! Do you still believe in the Easter bunny. \\n\\n \\n\\n The tooth fairy, and Miss Zarves too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s ask Mrs. Jewls!\" said Maurecia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s a teacher who\u0027s wise. Let\u0027s ask Mrs. Jewls. \\n\\n \\n\\n She never lies!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The children crowded round Their wise teacher\u0027s desk \\n\\n \\n\\n And asked her the question Never found on a test. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is there a Santa? \\n\\n \\n\\n You\u0027re a teacher with smarts! Is Santa Claus real?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They asked with pure hearts. \\n\\n \\n\\n And oh, Mrs. Jewls, That teacher so wise, \\n\\n \\n\\n Looked at their faces And bright, eager eyes. \\n\\n 42 \\n\\n She had to say something. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was her job to reply. \"Tell them!\" yelped Kathy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That reindeer can\u0027t fly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56926.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
