{"id":24699,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"Wayside School was no fun anymore. \n \n \"Hey, out of my way, buster!\" said Deedee as she pushed past Ron on her way to her seat. \n \n \"Hey, keep your hairy paws to yourself!\" said Ron. \n \n Nobody had any friends. Everybody hated everybody-except Miss Nogard. They all liked her. \n \n But then a miracle happened. \n \n A new kid came to school. \n \n The new kid couldn\u0027t talk. She had no teeth. She was almost bald. \n \n She was beautiful. \n \n Her name was Mavis Jewls. She was only four days old. \n \n She really was a new kid. \n \n Mrs. Jewls carried her into the classroom. \n \n And when the baby came through the door, all the hate flew out the window. \n \n Louis came in behind them carrying a bassinet, a diaper bag, an assortment of toys, and a baby bottle. \n \n \"It\u0027s Mrs. Jewls and her baby!\" Todd exclaimed. \n \n Louis set the bassinet on Todd\u0027s desk. Mrs. Jewls gently laid her baby down in it on soft yellow blankets. \n \n Everyone crowded around the little stranger. \n \n \"Look at her totally tiny toes!\" Bebe squealed. \"Aren\u0027t those the cutest things you\u0027ve ever seen in your whole life?\" \n \n \"Check out her nose!\" said Myron. \n \n \"Oh, she\u0027s so beautiful, Mrs. Jewls,\" said Joy. \"Can I touch her?\" \n \n \"Sure,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n They took turns touching the baby. \n \n \"Goo-goo, goo-goo,\" said Mac as he gently shook Mavis\u0027s little hand. \n \n \"Iggle wiggle poo poo,\" said Allison, tapping her on the nose. \n 164 \n \"Iggle wiggle poo poo poo,\" said Rondi, tickling her foot \n \n \"Yibble bibble,\" said Todd. \n \n \"Ooh goo boo boo,\" cooed Joe. \n \n \"She\u0027s never going to learn to talk around you kids,\" said Mrs. Jewls with a laugh. \n \n Dana was so happy she cried. She hugged Mrs. Jewls. \n \n They all took turns hugging Mrs. Jewls. \n \n Of course, there was one person who wasn\u0027t happy. \"May I hold her, Mrs. Jewls?\" Miss Nogard asked sweetly. \n \n Mrs. Jewls looked at the substitute teacher. \n \n \"It\u0027s okay,\" said Allison. \"Miss Nogard\u0027s a real nice teacher.\" \n \n \"Sure, go ahead,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"I\u0027m sorry for interrupting your class like this.\" \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s quite all right,\" said Miss Nogard, picking up Mrs. Jewls\u0027s baby. \"She\u0027s just adorable.\" \n \n The window by Shane\u0027s desk was wide open. That\u0027s kind of dangerous, Miss Nogard realized. Somebody might accidentally drop something out the window. \n \n She slowly moved toward it as she swayed with the baby. \"I\u0027ve heard so much about you, Mrs. Jewls,\" she said. \"The children have missed you.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve missed them too,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \n \n There was a rubber-band ball on the floor next to Shane\u0027s desk. Sharie had been making it, although it wasn\u0027t nearly as big as the one Mr. Kidswatter had been making. \n \n If I tripped over that rubber-band ball, something awful might happen, thought Miss Nogard. \n \n She was just about to step on it, when suddenly she became very curious about the kind of thoughts babies had. She had never listened to a baby\u0027s brain before. \n \n Miss Nogard held Mavis close to her heart and listened. . . . \n \n She gasped. Her face turned white, and her legs wobbled beneath her. As she tried to get her balance, she stepped on the rubber-band ball and fell toward the open window. \n \n Louis jumped over Shane\u0027s desk and grabbed her just in time. \n \n Mrs. Jewls hurried over. \n \n Miss Nogard tenderly handed Mrs. Jewls her baby. Then she fainted in Louis\u0027s arms. \n \n It is impossible to describe, in words, exactly what Miss Nogard heard when she listened to Mavis\u0027s brain. \n \n Babies don\u0027t think in words. \n 166 \n Miss Nogard heard pure love. And trust. And faith. With no words to get in the way. \n \n It was a love so strong that it dissolved away all the bitterness that had been caked around her heart. \n \n She opened her eyes. \n \n \"Are you all right, Miss Nogard?\" asked Stephen. \n \n All the children were very worried about her. \n \n Miss Nogard smiled at Louis, who was still holding her. \"I\u0027m fine,\" she said, then took a couple of steps to steady herself. \"In fact, I think I\u0027m better than I\u0027ve been in a long time.\" She laughed, then hugged Stephen. \n \n \"You should feel very proud of your class,\" she told Mrs. Jewls. \"They are bright well behaved, and just a pleasure to teach.\" \n \n \"We are?\" asked Maurecia. \n \n Miss Nogard fluffed Maurecia\u0027s hair. \"Yes, you are,\" she said. \n \n Maurecia smiled up at her. \n \n \"I know,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"As I told my obstetrician-\" \n \n \"Your what?\" asked Joy. \n \n \"Obstetrician,\" said Mrs. Jewls. \"That\u0027s the doctor who helped me have my baby. Then, once a baby is born, she gets a new doctor. That doctor is called a pediatrician. That\u0027s different from a podiatrist who is a doctor who takes care of people\u0027s feet. There are many different kinds of doctors. There\u0027s also a-\" \n \n Todd raised his hand. \"Mrs. Jewls, you\u0027re starting to get a little boring,\" he said. \n \n Mrs. Jewls made Todd write his name on the blackboard under the word DISCIPLINE. \n \n \"Hey, Louis!\" shouted Mac. \"Ask Miss Nogard out on a date!\" \n \n Everyone looked at Louis. \n \n Miss Nogard looked at him too. \n \n \"Do it, Louis!\" said Leslie. \n \n \"I really would like to get to know you better, Miss Nogard,\" he said. \n \n \"Ooooh,\" said Paul and Leslie. \n \n \"Way to go, Louis!\" cheered D. J. \n \n \"Call me Wendy,\" said Wendy Nogard. \n \n \"Ooooh,\" said Bebe and Calvin. \n \n \"Okay, Wendy,\" said Louis. \"And you can call me Louis.\" \n \n \"I already do,\" said Wendy. She smiled at him. \n \n He smiled back. \"So what do you say?\" he asked. \"Would you like to go out sometime?\" \n \n Miss Nogard hesitated. \n \n \"Say yes, Miss Nogard!\" urged Jenny. \n \n Miss Nogard took a deep breath. \"I like you, \n 168 \n Louis,\" she said. \"But I think there is something you should know about me first.\" \n \n She bent over and parted the hair on top of her head. \n \n Everyone crowded around as they tried to get a good look. \n \n \"It\u0027s an ear!\" shouted Jason. \n \n \"Yes, it is an ear,\" said Miss Nogard. \n \n \"Cool!\" said Terrence. \n \n \"Can I touch it?\" asked Dana. \n \n Everyone took turns touching her ear. \n \n The one on top of her head, I mean. \n \n \"So, Louis, are you sure you still want to go out with me?\" she asked. \n \n Louis held her hands in his. \"I like you a lot,\" he said. \"It doesn\u0027t matter how many ears you have.\" He paused for a second. \"How many ears do you have?\" \n \n \"Just three,\" she assured him. \n \n \"I think your ears are beautiful,\" said Louis. \"I think your nose and eyebrows are beautiful.\" \n \n Miss Nogard didn\u0027t have to read Louis\u0027s mind to know he was telling the truth. She could see it in his eyes. \n \n His eyes were like the moon. \n \n She kissed him. His mustache tickled. \n \n Everybody oooohed. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56949.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
