I never can say my name in front of people. He took a breath to steady himself. \"Well, we\u0027ve been reading-\" \"First tell me your name,\" Miss Nogard said sweetly. The muscles in Benjamin\u0027s face tightened. He concentrated real hard, then said, \"Benjamin Nushmutt.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" said Miss Nogard. \"Benjamin Nushmutt,\" he repeated. \"Henderson Schmidt?\" asked Miss Nogard. Benjamin sighed. \"Ben-ja-min Nush! Mutt!\" he shouted. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Miss Nogard. \"I must have been distracted. What did you say?\" Benjamin pressed his lips together. He tried to speak, but his mouth wouldn\u0027t open. \"His name is Benjamin,\" said Jason. \"Benjamin Nushmutt.\" \"Thank you,\" said Miss Nogard. \"That\u0027s a very nice name, Benjamin. You shouldn\u0027t be ashamed of it.\" Benjamin covered his red face with his hands. She turned to Jason. \"You look familiar. Do I know you?\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Jason. She stared at him, as if she were trying to remember. \"You\u0027re Justin, right?\" \"I\u0027m Jason. Justin\u0027s my older brother.\" \"So you\u0027re Justin\u0027s baby brother!\" said Miss Nogard. Everybody laughed. \"I remember Justin. I substituted for his class once. He was the brightest student I ever taught. You must feel very lucky to have such an exceptional brother.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1990/56941.html","bookId":676,"book":{"id":676,"title":"歪歪学校有点奇怪 Wayside School Gets a Little Stranger","description":"简介： All the kids from Wayside School had to spend 243 days in horrible schools while Wayside was closed to get rid of the cows {Don\u0027t ask!).
