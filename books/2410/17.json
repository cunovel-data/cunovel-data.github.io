Judge Murphy said, \"I have some questions before we go on. Mr. Sanders, you mentioned that wine was drunk during the meeting.\" \"Yes.\" \"How much wine would you say you had?\" \"Less than a glass.\" \"And Ms. Johnson? How much would you say?\" \"At least three glasses.\" \"All right.\" She made a note. \"Mr. Sanders, do you have an employment contract with the company?\" \"Yes.\" \"What is your understanding of what the contract says about transferring you or firing you?\" \"They can\u0027t fire me without cause,\" Sanders said. \"I don\u0027t know what it says about transfers. But my point is that by transferring me, they might as well be firing me-\" \"I understand your point,\" Murphy said, interrupting him. \"I\u0027m asking about your contract. Mr. Blackburn?\" Blackburn said, \"The relevant clause refers to `equivalent transfer.\u0027 \" \"I see. So it is arguable. Fine. Let\u0027s go on. Mr. Heller? Your questions for Mr. Sanders, please.\" Ben Heller shuffled his papers and cleared his throat. \"Mr. Sanders, would you like a break?\" \"No, I\u0027m fine.\" \"All right. Now, Mr. Sanders. You mentioned that when Mr. Blackburn told you on Monday morning that Ms. Johnson was going to be the new head of the division, you were surprised.\" \"Yes.\" \"Who did you think the new head would be?\" \"I didn\u0027t know. Actually, I thought I might be in line for it.\" \"Why did you think that?\" \"I just assumed it.\" \"Did anybody in the company, Mr. Blackburn or anybody else, lead you to think you were going to get the job?\" No. \"Was there anything in writing to suggest you would get the job?\" \"No.\" \"So when you say you assumed it, you were drawing a conclusion based on the general situation at the company, as you saw it.\" \"Yes.\" \"But not based on any real evidence?\" \"No.\" \"All right. Now, you\u0027ve said that when Mr. Blackburn told you that Ms. Johnson was going to get the job, he also told you that she could choose new division heads if she wanted, and you told him you interpreted that to mean Ms. Johnson had the power to fire you?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s what he said.\" \"Did he characterize it in any way? For example, did he say it was likely or unlikely?\" \"He said it was unlikely.\" \"And did you believe him?\" \"I wasn\u0027t sure what to believe, at that point.\" \"Is Mr. Blackburn\u0027s judgment on company matters reliable?\" \"Ordinarily, yes.\" \"But in any case, Mr. Blackburn did say that Ms. Johnson had the right to fire you.\" \"Yes.\" \"Did Ms. Johnson ever say anything like that to you?\" \"No.\" \"She never made any statement that could be interpreted as an offer contingent upon your performance, including sexual performance?\" \"No.\" \"So when you say that during your meeting with her you felt that your job was at risk, that was not because of anything Ms. Johnson actually said or did?\" \"No,\" Sanders said. \"But it was in the situation.\" \"You perceived it as being in the situation.\" \"Yes.\" \"As you had earlier perceived that you were in line for a promotion, when in fact you were not? The very promotion that Ms. Johnson ended up getting?\" \"I don\u0027t follow you.\" \"I\u0027m merely observing,\" Heller said, \"that perceptions are subjective, and do not have the weight of fact.\" \"Objection,\" Fernandez said. \"Employee perceptions have been held valid in contexts where the reasonable expectation-\" \"Ms. Fernandez,\" Murphy said, \"Mr. Heller hasn\u0027t challenged the validity of your client\u0027s perceptions. He has questioned their accuracy.\" \"But surely they are accurate. Because Ms. Johnson was his superior, and she could fire him if she wanted to.\" \"That\u0027s not in dispute. But Mr. Heller is asking whether Mr. Sanders has a tendency to build up unjustified expectations. And that seems to me entirely relevant.\" \"But with all due respect, Your Honor-\" \"Ms. Fernandez,\" Murphy said, \"we\u0027re here to clarify this dispute. I\u0027m going to let Mr. Heller continue. Mr. Heller?\" \"Thank you, Your Honor. So to summarize, Mr. Sanders: Although you felt your job was on the line, you never got that sense from Ms. Johnson?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t.\" \"Or from Mr. Blackburn?\" \"No.\" \"Or, in fact, from anyone else?\" \"No.\" \"All right. Let\u0027s turn to something else. How did it happen that there was wine at the six o\u0027clock meeting?\" \"Ms. Johnson said that she would get a bottle of wine.\" \"You didn\u0027t ask her to do that?\" \"No. She volunteered to do it.\" \"And what was your reaction?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" He shrugged. \"Nothing in particular.\" \"Were you pleased?\" \"I didn\u0027t think about it one way or the other.\" \"Let me put it a different way, Mr. Sanders. When you heard that an attractive woman like Ms. Johnson was planning to have a drink with you after work, what went through your head?\" \"I thought I better do it. She\u0027s my boss.\" \"That\u0027s all you thought?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you mention to anyone that you wanted to be alone with Ms. Johnson in a romantic setting?\" Sanders sat forward, surprised. \"No.\" \"Are you sure about that?\" \"Yes.\" Sanders shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re driving at.\" \"Isn\u0027t Ms. Johnson your former lover?\" \"Yes.\" \"And didn\u0027t you want to resume your intimate relationship?\" \"No, I did not. I was just hoping we would be able to find some way to be able to work together.\" \"Is that difficult? I would have thought it\u0027d be quite easy to work together, since you knew each other so well in the past.\" \"Well, it\u0027s not. It\u0027s quite awkward.\" \"Is it? Why is that?\" \"Well. It just is. I had never actually worked with her. I knew her in a totally different context, and I just felt awkward.\" \"How did your prior relationship with Ms. Johnson end, Mr. Sanders?\" \"We just sort of . . . drifted apart.\" \"You had been living together at the time?\" \"Yes. And we had our normal ups and downs. And finally, it just didn\u0027t work out. So we split up.\" \"No hard feelings?\" No. \"Who left whom?\" \"It was sort of mutual, as I recall.\" \"Whose idea was it to move out?\" \"I guess . . . I don\u0027t really remember. I guess it was mine.\" \"So there was no awkwardness or tension about how the affair ended, ten years ago.\" \"No.\" \"And yet you felt there was awkwardness now?\" \"Sure,\" Sanders said. \"Because we had one kind of relationship in the past, and now we were going to have another kind of relationship.\" \"You mean, now Ms. Johnson was going to be your superior.\" \"Yes.\" \"Weren\u0027t you angry about that? About her appointment?\" \"A little. I guess.\" \"Only a little? Or perhaps more than a little?\" Fernandez sat forward and started to protest. Murphy shot her a warning look. Fernandez put her fists under her chin and said nothing. \"I was a lot of things,\" Sanders said. \"I was angry and disappointed and confused and worried.\" \"So in your mind, although you were feeling many different and confusing feelings, you\u0027re certain that you did not, under any circumstances, contemplate having sex with Ms. Johnson that night.\" \"No.\" \"It never crossed your mind?\" \"No.\" There was a pause. Heller shuffled his notes, then looked up. \"You\u0027re married, are you not, Mr. Sanders?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"Did you call your wife to tell her you had a late meeting?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you tell her with whom?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"My wife is sometimes jealous about my past relationships. I didn\u0027t see any reason to cause her anxiety or make her upset.\" \"You mean, if you told her you were having a late meeting with Ms. Johnson, your wife might think that you would renew your sexual acquaintance.\" \"I don\u0027t know what she would think,\" Sanders said. \"But in any case, you didn\u0027t tell her about Ms. Johnson.\" \"No.\" \"What did you tell her?\" \"I told her I had a meeting and I would be home late.\" \"How late?\" \"I told her it might run to dinner or after.\" \"I see. Had Ms. Johnson suggested dinner to you?\" \"No.\" \"So you presumed, when you called your wife, that your meeting with Ms. Johnson might be a long one?\" \"No,\" Sanders said. \"I didn\u0027t. But I didn\u0027t know exactly how long it would be. And my wife doesn\u0027t like me to call once and say I\u0027ll be an hour late, and then call again to say it\u0027ll be two hours. That annoys her. So it\u0027s easier for her if I just tell her I may be home after dinner. That way, she doesn\u0027t expect me and doesn\u0027t wait for me; and if I get home early, it\u0027s great.\" \"So this is your usual policy with your wife.\" \"Yes.\" \"Nothing unusual.\" \"No.\" \"In other words, your usual procedure is to lie to your wife about events at the office because in your view she can\u0027t take the truth.\" \"Objection,\" Fernandez said. \"What\u0027s the relevance?\" \"That\u0027s not it at all,\" Sanders continued, angrily. \"How is it, Mr. Sanders?\" \"Look. Every marriage has its own way to work things out. This is ours. It makes things smoother, that\u0027s all. It\u0027s about scheduling at home, not about lying.\" \"But wouldn\u0027t you say that you lied when you failed to tell your wife you were seeing Ms. Johnson that night?\" \"Objection,\" Fernandez said. Murphy said, \"I think this is quite enough, Mr. Heller.\" \"Your Honor, I\u0027m trying to show that Mr. Sanders intended to consummate an encounter with Ms. Johnson, and that all his behavior is consistent with that. And in addition, to show that he routinely treats women with contempt.\" \"You haven\u0027t shown that, you haven\u0027t even laid a groundwork for that,\" Murphy said. \"Mr. Sanders has explained his reasons, and in the absence of contrary evidence I accept them. Do you have contrary evidence?\" \"No, Your Honor.\" \"Very well. Bear in mind that inflammatory and unsubstantiated characterizations do not assist our mutual efforts at resolution.\" \"Yes, Your Honor.\" \"I want everyone here to be clear: these proceedings are potentially damaging to all parties-not only in their outcome, but in the conduct of the proceedings themselves. Depending on the outcome, Ms. Johnson and Mr. Sanders may find themselves working together in some capacity in the future. I will not permit these proceedings to unnecessarily poison such future relationships. Any further unwarranted accusations will cause me to halt these proceedings. Does anyone have any questions about what I\u0027ve just said?\" No one did. \"All right. Mr. Heller?\" Heller sat back. \"No further questions, Your Honor.\" \"All right,\" Judge Murphy said. \"We\u0027ll break for five minutes, and return to hear Ms. Johnson\u0027s version.\" You\u0027re doing fine,\" Fernandez said. \"You\u0027re doing very well. Your ice was strong. You were clear and even. Murphy was impressed. You\u0027re doing fine.\" They were standing outside, by the fountains in the courtyard. Sanders felt like a boxer between rounds, being worked over by his trainer. \"How do you feel?\" she asked. \"Tired?\" \"A little. Not too bad.\" \"You want coffee?\" \"No, I\u0027m okay.\" \"Good. Because the hard part is coming up. You\u0027re going to have to be very strong when she gives her version. You won\u0027t like what she says. But it\u0027s important that you stay calm.\" \"Okay.\" She put her hand on his shoulder. \"By the way, just between us: How did the relationship end?\" \"To tell the truth, I can\u0027t remember exactly.\" Fernandez looked skeptical. \"But this was important, surely . . .\" \"It was almost ten years ago,\" Sanders said. \"To me, it feels like another lifetime.\" She was still skeptical. \"Look,\" Sanders said. \"This is the third week in June. What was going on in your love life the third week of June, ten years ago? Can you tell me?\" Fernandez was silent, frowning. \"Were you married?\" Sanders prompted. No. \"Met your husband yet?\" \"Uh, let\u0027s see . . . no . . . not until . . . I must have met my husband . . . about a year later.\" \"Okay. Do you remember who you were seeing before him?\" Fernandez was silent. Thinking. \"How about anything that happened between you and a lover in June, ten years ago?\" She was still silent. \"See what I mean?\" Sanders said. \"Ten years is a long time. I remember the affair with Meredith, but I\u0027m not clear about the last few weeks of it. I don\u0027t remember the details of how it ended.\" \"What do you remember?\" He shrugged. \"We had more fights, more yelling. We were still living together, but somehow, we began to arrange our schedules so that we never saw each other. You know how that happens. Because when we did run into each other, we fought. \"And finally one night, we had a big argument while we were getting dressed to go to a party. Some formal party for DigiCom. I remember I had to wear a tux. I threw my cuff links at her and then I couldn\u0027t find them. I had to get down on the floor and look. But once we were driving to the party, we sort of calmed down, and we started talking about breaking up. In this very ordinary way. Very reasonable way. It just came out. Both of us. Nobody shouted. And in the end, we decided it was best if we broke it off.\" Fernandez was looking at him thoughtfully. \"That\u0027s it?\" \"Yeah.\" He shrugged. \"Except we never got to the party.\" Something at the back of his mind. A couple in a car, going to a party. Something about a cellular pbone. All dressed up, going to the party and they make a call, and He couldn\u0027t get it. It hung in his memory, just beyond recollection. The woman made a call on the cellular pbone, and then . . . Something embarrassing afterward . . . \"Tom?\" Fernandez said, shaking his shoulder. \"Looks like our time is about up. Ready to go back?\" \"I\u0027m ready,\" he said. As they were heading back to the mediation room, Heller came over. He gave Sanders an oily smile, then turned to Fernandez. \"Counselor,\" he said. \"I wonder if this is the time to talk about settlement.\" \"Settlement?\" Fernandez said, showing elaborate surprise. \"Why?\" \"Well, things aren\u0027t going so well for your client, and-\" \"Things are going fine for my client-\" \"And this whole inquiry will only get more embarrassing and awkward for him, the longer it continues\" \"My client isn\u0027t embarrassed at all-\" \"And perhaps it is to everyone\u0027s advantage to end it now.\" Fernandez smiled. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s my client\u0027s wish, Ben, but if you have an offer to make, we will of course entertain it.\" \"Yes. I have an offer.\" \"All right.\" Heller cleared his throat. \"Considering Tom\u0027s current compensation base and associated benefits package, and taking into consideration his lengthy service with the company, we\u0027re prepared to settle for an amount equal to several years of compensation. We\u0027ll add an allowance for your fees and other miscellaneous expenses of termination, the cost of a headhunter to relocate to a new position, and all direct costs that may be associated with moving his household, and all together make it four hundred thousand dollars. I think that\u0027s very generous.\" \"I\u0027ll see what my client says,\" Fernandez said. She took Sanders by the arm, and walked a short distance away. \"Well?\" \"No,\" Sanders said. \"Not so fast,\" she said. \"That\u0027s a pretty reasonable offer. It\u0027s as much as you\u0027re likely to get in court, without the delay and expenses.\" \"No.\" \"Want to counter?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-17.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ...
