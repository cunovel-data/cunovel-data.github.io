He was pretty sure who had done it, but he had to be sure. \"Angel, how do I check deletion authorization?\"\n \"Press the data you desire,\" the Angel said.\n Sanders pressed the authorization number. A small sheet of paper came upward out of the top sheet and hung in the air:\n AUTHORIZATION DC/C/5905 IS\n DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS\n CUPERTINO/OPERATIONS EXECUTIVE\n SPECIAL PRIVILEGES NOTED\n (NO OPERATOR ID NECESSARY)\n \"It was done by somebody very high up in Operations in Cupertino, a few days ago.\"\n \"Meredith?\"\n \"Probably. And it means I\u0027m screwed.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because now I know what was done at the Malaysia plant. I know exactly what happened: Meredith went in and changed the specs. But she\u0027s erased the data, right down to her voice transmissions to Kahn. Which means I can\u0027t prove any of it.\"\n Standing in the corridor, Sanders poked the sheet, and it fluttered back down, dissolving into the top sheet. He closed his file, put it back in the drawer, and watched the model dissolve and disappear.\n He looked over at Conley. Conley gave a little resigned shrug. He seemed to understand the situation. Sanders shook his hand, gripping air, and waved good-bye. Conley nodded and turned to leave.\n \"Now what?\" Fernandez said.\n \"It\u0027s time to go,\" Sanders said.\n The angel began to sing: \"It\u0027s time to go, so long again till next week\u0027s show\"\n \"Angel, be quiet.\" The angel stopped singing. He shook his head. `Just like Don Cherry.\"\n \"Who\u0027s Don Cherry?\" Fernandez asked.\n \"Don Cherry is a living god,\" the angel said.\n They walked back to the entrance to the Corridor and then climbed out of the blue screen.\n Back in Cherry\u0027s lab, Sanders took off the headset and, after a moment of disorientation, stepped off the walker pad. He helped Fernandez remove her equipment. \"Oh,\" she said, looking around. \"We\u0027re back in the real world.\"\n \"If that\u0027s what you call it,\" he said. \"I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s that much more real.\" He hung up her headset and helped her down from the walker pad. Then he turned off the power switches around the room.\n Fernandez yawned and looked at her watch. \"It\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock. What are you going to do now?\"\n There was only one thing he could think of. He picked up the receiver on one of Cherry\u0027s data modem lines and dialed Gary Bosak\u0027s number. Sanders couldn\u0027t retrieve any data, but perhaps Bosak couldif he could talk him into it. It wasn\u0027t much of a hope. But it was all he could think to do.\n An answering machine said, \"Hi, this is NE Professional Services. I\u0027m out of town for a few days, but leave a message.\" And then a beep.\n Sanders sighed. \"Gary, it\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock on Wednesday. I\u0027m sorry I missed you. I\u0027m going home.\" He hung up.\n His last hope.\n Gone.\n Out of town for a few days.\n \"Shit,\" he said.\n \"Now what?\" Fernandez said, yawning.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got half an hour to make the last ferry. I guess I\u0027ll go home and try to get some sleep.\"\n \"And the meeting tomorrow?\" she asked. \"You said you need documentation.\"\n Sanders shrugged. \"Louise, I\u0027ve done all that I can do. I know what I\u0027m up against. I\u0027ll manage somehow.\"\n \"Then I\u0027ll see you tomorrow?\"\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"See you tomorrow.\"\n He felt less sanguine on the ferry going home, looking back at the lights of the city in the rippling black water. Fernandez was right; he ought to be getting the documentation he needed. Max would criticize him, if he knew. He could almost hear the old man\u0027s voice: \"Oh, so you\u0027re tired? That\u0027s a good reason, Thomas.\"\n He wondered if Max would be at the meeting tomorrow. But he found he couldn\u0027t really think about it. He couldn\u0027t imagine the meeting. He was too tired to concentrate. The loudspeaker announced that they were five minutes from Winslow, and he went below decks to get into his car.\n He unlocked the door and slipped behind the wheel. He looked in the rearview mirror and saw a dark silhouette in the backseat.\n \"Hey,\" Gary Bosak said.\n Sanders started to turn.\n \"Just keep looking forward,\" Bosak said. \"I\u0027ll get out in a minute. Now listen carefully. They\u0027re going to screw you tomorrow. They\u0027re going to pin the Malaysia fiasco on you.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"And if that doesn\u0027t work, they\u0027re going to hit you with employing me. Invasion of privacy. Felonious activity. All that crap. They\u0027ve talked to my parole officer. Maybe you\u0027ve seen him-a fat guy with a mustache?\"\n Sanders vaguely remembered the man walking up to the mediation center the day before. \"I think so, yes. Gary, listen, I need some documents-\"\n \"Don\u0027t talk. There\u0027s no time. They pulled all the documents relating to the plant off the system. Nothing\u0027s there anymore. It\u0027s gone. I can\u0027t help you.\" They heard the sound of the ferry horn. All around them, drivers were starting their engines. \"But I\u0027m not going down for this felony crap. And you\u0027re not, either. Take this.\" He reached forward, and handed Sanders an envelope.\n \"What\u0027s this?\"\n \"Summary of some work I did for another officer of your company. Garvin. You might want to fax it to him in the morning.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you?\"\n \"I\u0027m crossing the border tonight. I have a cousin in BC, I\u0027ll stay there for a while. You can leave a message on my machine if it turns out okay.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"Stay cool, guy. The shit\u0027s really going to hit the fan tomorrow. Lots of changes coming.\"\n Up ahead, the ramp went down with a metallic clang. The traffic officers were directing cars off the ferry.\n \"Gary. You\u0027ve been monitoring me?\"\n \"Yeah. Sorry about that. They told me I had to.\"\n \"Then who\u0027s `Afriend\u0027?\"\n Bosak laughed. He opened the door and got out. \"I\u0027m surprised at you, Tom. Don\u0027t you know who your friends are?\"\n The cars were beginning to pull out. Sanders saw brake lights on the car ahead of him flash red, and the car began to move.\n \"Gary\" he said, turning. But Bosak was gone.\n He put the car in gear and drove off the ferry.\n A the top of the driveway, he stopped to pick up his mail. There was a lot of it; he hadn\u0027t checked the mailbox for two days. He drove down to the house and left the car outside the garage. He unlocked the front door and went in. The house seemed empty and cold. It had a lemony odor. Then he remembered that Consuela had probably cleaned up.\n He went into the kitchen and set up the coffeemaker for the morning. The kitchen was clean and the children\u0027s toys had been picked up; Consuela had definitely been there. He looked at the answering machine.\n A red numeral was blinking: 14.\n Sanders replayed the calls. The first was from John Levin, asking him to call, saying it was urgent. Then Sally, asking if the kids could arrange a play date. But then the rest were all hang-ups. And as he listened, they all seemed to sound exactly the same the thin hissing background static of an overseas call and then the abrupt click of disconnection. Again and again.\n Someone was trying to call him.\n One of the later calls was apparently placed by an operator, because a woman\u0027s lilting voice said, \"I\u0027m sorry, there is no answer. Do you wish to leave a message?\" And then a man\u0027s voice replied, \"No.\" And then disconnection.\n Sanders played it back, listening to that \"No.\"\n He thought it sounded familiar. Foreign, but still familiar.\n \"No.\"\n He listened several times but could not identify the speaker.\n \"No.\"\n One time, he thought the man sounded hesitant. Or was it hurried? He couldn\u0027t tell.\n \"Do you wish to leave a message?\"\n \"No.\"\n Finally he gave up, rewound the machine, and went upstairs to his office. He\u0027d had no faxes. His computer screen was blank. No further help from \"Afriend\" tonight.\n He read through the paper that Bosak had given him in the car. It was a single sheet, a memo addressed to Garvin, containing a report summary on a Cupertino employee whose name was blanked out. There was also a xerox of a check made out to NE Professional Services signed by Garvin.\n It was after one when Sanders went into the bathroom and took a shower. He turned the water up hot, held his face close to the nozzle, and felt the stinging spray on his skin. With the sound of the shower roaring in his ears, he almost missed hearing the telephone ringing. He grabbed a towel and ran into the bedroom.\n \"Hello?\"\n He heard the static hiss of an overseas connection. A man\u0027s voice said, \"Mr. Sanders, please.\"\n \"This is Mr. Sanders speaking.\"\n \"Mr. Sanders, sir,\" the voice said, \"I do not know if you will remember me. This is Mohammed Jafar.\"\n THURSDAY\n The morning was clear. Sanders took an early ferry to work and got to his office at eight. He passed the downstairs receptionist and saw a sign that said \"Main Conference Room in Use.\" For a horrified moment he thought that he had again mistaken the time for his meeting, and hurried to look in. But it was Garvin, addressing the Conley-White executives. Garvin was speaking calmly, and the executives were nodding as they listened. Then as he watched, Garvin finished and introduced Stephanie Kaplan, who immediately launched into a financial review with slides. Garvin left the conference room, and immediately his expression turned grim as he walked down the hallway toward the espresso bar at the end of the corridor, ignoring Sanders.\n Sanders was about to head upstairs when he heard Phil Blackburn say, \"I really feel I have a right to protest the way this matter has been handled.\"\n \"Well, you don\u0027t,\" Garvin said angrily. \"You don\u0027t have any rights at all.\"\n Sanders moved forward, toward the espresso bar. From his position across the hallway, he was able to see into the bar. Blackburn and Garvin were talking by the coffee machines.\n \"But this is extremely unfair,\" Blackburn said.\n \"Fuck unfair,\" Garvin said. \"She named you as the source, you stupid asshole.\"\n \"But Bob, you told me-\"\n \"I told you what?\" Garvin said, eyes narrowing.\n \"You told me to handle it. To put pressure on Sanders.\"\n \"That\u0027s right, Phil. And you told me that you were going to take care of it.\u0027\n But you knew I talked to-\"\n \"I knew you had done something,\" Garvin said. \"But I didn\u0027t know what. Now she\u0027s named you as a source.\"\n Blackburn hung his head. \"I just think it\u0027s extremely unfair.\"\n \"Really? But what do you expect me to do? You\u0027re the fucking lawyer, Phil. You\u0027re the one always sweating about how things look. You tell me. What do I do?\"\n Blackburn was silent for a moment. Finally he said, \"I\u0027ll get John Robinson to represent me. He can work out the settlement agreement.\"\n \"Okay, fine.\" Garvin nodded. \"That\u0027s fine.\"\n \"But I just want to say to you, on a personal level, Bob, that I feel my treatment in this matter has been very unfair.\"\n \"Goddamn it, Phil, don\u0027t talk to me about your feelings. Your feelings are for sale. Now listen with both ears: Don\u0027t go upstairs. Don\u0027t clean out your desk. Go right to the airport. I want you on a plane in the next half hour. I want you fucking out of here, right now. Is that clear?\"\n \"I just think you should acknowledge my contribution to the company.\"\n \"I am, you asshole,\" Garvin said. \"Now get the fuck out of here, before I lose my temper.\"\n Sanders turned and hurried upstairs. It was hard for him to keep from cheering. Blackburn was fired! He wondered if he should tell anybody; perhaps Cindy, he thought.\n But when he got to the fourth floor, the hallways were buzzing; everyone was out of their offices, talking in the corridors. Obviously, rumors of the firing had already leaked. Sanders was not surprised that staffers were in hallways. Even though Blackburn was disliked, his firing would cause widespread uneasiness. Such a sudden change, involving a person so close to Garvin, conveyed to everyone a sense of peril. Everything was at risk.\n Outside his office, Cindy said, \"Tom, can you believe it? They say Garvin is going to fire Phil.\"\n \"You\u0027re kidding,\" Sanders said.\n Cindy nodded. \"Nobody knows why, but apparently it had something to do with a news crew last night. Garvin\u0027s been downstairs explaining it to the Conley-White people.\"\n Behind him, somebody shouted, \"It\u0027s on the e-mail!\" The hallway was instantly deserted; everyone vanished into their offices. Sanders stepped behind his desk and clicked the e-mail icon. But it was slow coming up, probably because every employee in the building was clicking at exactly the same time.\n Fernandez came in and said, \"Is it true about Blackburn?\" \"I guess so,\" Sanders said. \"It\u0027s just coming over the e-mail now.\"\n FROM: ROBERT GARVIN, PRESIDENT AND CEO\n TO: ALL THE DIGICOM FAMILY\n IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS AND A DEEP SENSE OF PERSONAL LOSS THAT I TODAY ANNOUNCE THE RESIGNATION OF OUR VALUED AND TRUSTED CHIEF CORPORATE COUNSEL, PHILIP A. BLACKBURN. PHIL HAS BEEN AN OUTSTANDING OFFICER OF THIS COMPANY FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS, A WONDERFUL HUMAN BEING, AND A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND AND ADVISOR AS WELL. I KNOW THAT LIKE ME, MANY OF YOU WILL MISS HIS WISE COUNSEL AND GOOD HUMOR PROFOUNDLY IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS TO COME. AND I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL ALL JOIN ME IN WISHING HIM THE BEST OF GOOD FORTUNE IN HIS NEW ENDEAVORS. A HEARTY THANK YOU, PHIL. AND GOOD LUCK.\n THIS RESIGNATION IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY. HOWARD EBERHARDT WILL SERVE AS ACTING COUNSEL UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A NEW PERMANENT APPOINTMENT IS MADE.\n ROBERT GARVIN\n Fernandez said, \"What does it say?\" \"It says, `I fired his sanctimonious ass.\u0027 \" \"It had to happen,\" Fernandez said. \"Especially since he was the source on the Connie Walsh story.\" Sanders said, \"How did you know that?\" \"Eleanor Vries.\" \"She told you?\" \"No. But Eleanor Vries is a very cautious attorney. All those media attorneys are. The safest way to keep your job is to refuse to let things run. When in doubt, throw it out. So I had to ask myself, why did she let the Mr. Piggy story run, when it\u0027s clearly defamatory. The only possible reason is that she felt Walsh had an unusually strong source inside the company-a source that understood the legal implications. A source that, in giving the story, was in essence also saying, we won\u0027t sue if you print it. Since high-ranking corporate officers never know anything about law, it means the source could only be a high-ranking lawyer.\"\n \"Phil.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \".Jesus.\"\n \"Does this change your plans?\" Fernandez said.\n Sanders had been considering that. \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said. \"I think Garvin would have fired him later in the day, anyway.\"\n \"You sound confident.\"\n \"Yeah. I got some ammunition last night. And I hope more today.\"\n Cindy came in and said, \"Are you expecting something from KL? A big file?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"This one\u0027s been coming in since 7 a.m. It must be a monster.\" She put a DAT cartridge on his desk. It was exactly like the DAT cartridge that had recorded his video link with Arthur Kahn.\n Fernandez looked at him. He shrugged.\n At eight-thirty, he transmitted Bosak\u0027s memo to Garvin\u0027s private fax machine. Then he asked Cindy to make copies of all the faxes that Mohammed Jafar had sent him the previous night. Sanders had been up most of the night, reading the material that Jafar had sent him. And it made interesting reading.\n Jafar of course was not ill; he had never been ill. That had been a little story that Kahn had contrived with Meredith.\n He pushed the DAT videocassette into the machine, and turned to Fernandez.\n \"You going to explain?\" she said.\n \"I hope it\u0027ll be self-explanatory,\" Sanders said.\n On the monitor, the following appeared:\n 5 SECONDS TO DIRECT VIDEO LINKUP: DC/M-DC/C\n SEN: A. KAHN\n REC: M. JOHNSON\n On the screen, he saw Kahn at the factory, and then a moment later the screen split and he saw Meredith at her office in Cupertino.\n \"What is this?\" Fernandez said.\n \"A recorded video communication. From last Sunday.\"\n \"I thought the communications were all erased.\"\n \"They were, here. But there was still a record in KL. A friend of mine sent it to me.\"\n On the screen, Arthur Kahn coughed. \"Uh, Meredith. I\u0027m a little concerned.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be,\" Meredith said.\n \"But we still aren\u0027t able to manufacture to specs. We have to replace the air handlers, at the very least. Put in better ones.\"\n \"Not now.\"\n \"But we have to, Meredith.\"\n \"Not yet.\"\n \"But those handlers are inadequate, Meredith. We both thought they\u0027d be okay, but they aren\u0027t.\"\n \"Never mind.\"\n Kahn was sweating. He rubbed his chin nervously. \"It\u0027s only a matter of time before Tom figures it out, Meredith. He\u0027s not stupid, you know.\"\n \"He\u0027ll be distracted.\"\n \"So you say.\"\n \"And besides, he\u0027s going to quit.\"\n Kahn looked startled. \"He is? I don\u0027t think he-\"\n \"Trust me. He\u0027ll quit. He\u0027s going to hate working for me.\"\n Sitting in Sanders\u0027s office, Fernandez leaned forward, staring at the screen. She said, \"No shit.\"\n Kahn said, \"Why will he hate it?\"\n Meredith said, \"Believe me. He will. Tom Sanders will be out in my first forty-eight hours.\"\n \"But how can you be sure-\"\n \"What choice does he have? Tom and I have a history. Everybody in the company knows that. If any problem comes up, nobody will believe him. He\u0027s smart enough to understand that. If he ever wants to work again, he\u0027ll have no choice but to take whatever settlement he\u0027s offered and leave.\"\n Kahn nodded, wiping the sweat from his cheek. \"And then we say Sanders made the changes at the plant? He\u0027ll deny that he did.\"\n \"He won\u0027t even know. Remember. He\u0027ll be gone by then, Arthur.\"\n \"And if he isn\u0027t?\"\n \"Trust me. He\u0027ll be gone. He\u0027s married, has a family. He\u0027ll go.\"\n \"But if he calls me about the production line-\"\n \"Just evade it, Arthur. Be mystified. You can do that, I\u0027m sure. Now, who else does Sanders talk to there?\"\n \"The foreman, sometimes. Jafar. Jafar knows everything, of course. And he\u0027s one of those honest sorts. I\u0027m afraid if-\"\n \"Make him take a vacation.\"\n \"He just took one.\"\n \"Make him take another one, Arthur. I only need a week here.\"\n \"Jesus,\" Kahn said. \"I\u0027m not sure-\"\n She cut in: \"Arthur.\"\n \"Yes, Meredith.\"\n \"This is the time when a new vice president counts favors that will be repaid in the future.\"\n \"Yes, Meredith.\"\n \"That\u0027s all.\"\n The screen went blank. There were white streaking video lines, and then the screen was dark.\n \"Pretty cut and dried,\" Fernandez said.\n Sanders nodded. \"Meredith didn\u0027t think the changes would matter, because she didn\u0027t know anything about production. She was just cutting costs. But she knew that the changes at the plant would eventually be traced back to her, so she thought she had a way to get rid of me, to make me quit the company. And then she would be able to blame me for the problems at the plant.\"\n \"And Kahn went along with it.\"\n Sanders nodded.\n \"And they got rid of Jafar.\"\n Sanders nodded. \"Kahn told Jafar to go visit his cousin in Johore for a week to get out of town. To make it impossible for me to reach Jafar. But he never thought that Jafar would call me.\" He glanced at his watch. \"Now, where is it?\"\n \"What?\"\n On the screen, there was a series of tones, and they saw a handsome, dark skinned newscaster at a desk, facing a camera and speaking rapidly in a foreign language.\n \"What\u0027s this?\" Fernandez said.\n \"The Channel Three evening news, from last December.\" Sanders got up and pushed a button on the tape machine. The cassette popped out.\n \"What does it show?\"\n Cindy came back from the copying machine with wide eyes. She carried a dozen stacks of paper, each neatly clipped. \"What\u0027re you going to do with this?\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he said.\n \"But this is outrageous, Tom. What she\u0027s done.\"\n \"I know,\" he said.\n \"Everybody is talking,\" she said. \"The word is that the merger is off.\"\n \"We\u0027ll see,\" Sanders said.\n With Cindy\u0027s help, he began arranging the piles of paper in identical manila folders. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-27.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: \n The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ... \n Thomas Sanders\u0027 world collapses in just 24 hours – he is passed over for promotion, his new woman boss comes on to him during a drink after work, then, the next morning, he learns that she has accused him of sexually harassing her.
