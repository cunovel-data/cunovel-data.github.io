{"id":74930,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"They canceled your nine-thirty meeting because of all the personnel changes,\" Cindy said.\\n\\n \"What changes?\" Sanders said. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s been some kind of reorganization,\" Cindy said. She avoided meeting his eyes, and looked down at the call book on her desk. \"They just scheduled a private lunch with all the division heads in the main conference room for twelve-thirty today, and Phil Blackburn is on his way down to talk to you. He should be here any minute. Let\u0027s see, what else? DHL is delivering drives from Kuala Lumpur this afternoon. Gary Bosak wants to meet with you at ten-thirty.\" She ran her finger down the call book. \"Don Cherry called twice about the Corridor, and you just got a rush call from Eddie in Austin.\"\\n\\n \"Call him back.\" Eddie Larson was the production supervisor in the Austin plant, which made cellular telephones. Cindy placed the call; a moment later he heard the familiar voice with the Texas twang.\\n\\n \"Hey there, Tommy boy.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Eddie. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Little problem on the line. You got a minute?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sure.\"\\n\\n \"Are congratulations on a new job in order?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t heard anything yet,\" Sanders said.\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. But it\u0027s going to happen?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t heard anything, Eddie.\"\\n\\n \"Is it true they\u0027re going to shut down the Austin plant?\"\\n\\n Sanders was so startled, he burst out laughing. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Hey, that\u0027s what they\u0027re saying down here, Tommy boy. Conley-White is going to buy the company and then shut us down.\"\\n\\n \"Hell,\" Sanders said. \"Nobody\u0027s buying anything, and nobody\u0027s selling anything, Eddie. The Austin line is an industry standard. And it\u0027s very profitable.\"\\n\\n He paused. \"You\u0027d tell me if you knew, wouldn\u0027t you, Tommy boy?\" \"Yes, I would,\" Sanders said. \"But it\u0027s just a rumor, Eddie. So forget it. Now, what\u0027s the line problem?\"\\n\\n \"Diddly stuff. The women on the production line are demanding that we clean out the pinups in the men\u0027s locker room. They say it\u0027s offensive to them. You ask me, I think it\u0027s bull,\" Larson said. \"Because women never go into the men\u0027s locker room.\"\\n\\n \"Then how do they know about the pinups?\"\\n\\n \"The night cleanup crews have women on \u0027em. So now the women working the line want the pinups removed.\"\\n\\n Sanders sighed. \"We don\u0027t need any complaints about being unresponsive on sex issues. Get the pinups out.\"\\n\\n \"Even if the women have pinups in their locker room?\"\\n\\n \"Just do it, Eddie.\"\\n\\n \"You ask me, it\u0027s caving in to a lot of feminist bullshit.\" There was a knock on the door. Sanders looked up and saw Phil Blackburn, the company lawyer, standing there. \"Eddie, I have to go.\" \"Okay,\" Eddie said, \"but I\u0027m telling you-\" \"Eddie, I\u0027m sorry. I have to go. Call me if anything changes.\" Sanders hung up the phone, and Blackburn came into the room. Sanders\u0027s first impression was that the lawyer was smiling too broadly, behaving too cheerfully. It was a bad sign.\\n\\n Philip Blackburn, the chief legal counsel for DigiCom, was a slender man of forty six wearing a dark green Hugo Boss suit. Like Sanders, Blackburn had been with DigiCom for over a decade, which meant that he was one of the \"old guys,\" one of those who had \"gotten in at the beginning.\" When Sanders first met him, Blackburn was a brash, bearded young civil rights lawyer from Berkeley. But Blackburn had long since abandoned protest for profits, which he pursued with singleminded intensity-while carefully emphasizing the new corporate issues of diversity and equal opportunity. Blackburn\u0027s embrace of the latest fashions in clothing and correctness made \"PC Phil\" a figure of fun in some quarters of the company. As one executive put it, \"Phil\u0027s finger is chapped from wetting it and holding it to the wind.\" He was the first with Birkenstocks, the first with bell-bottoms, the first with sideburns off, and the first with diversity.\\n\\n Many of the jokes focused on his mannerisms. Fussy, preoccupied with appearances, Blackburn was always running his hands over himself, touching his hair, his face, his suit, seeming to caress himself, to smooth out the wrinkles in his suit. This, combined with his unfortunate tendency to rub, touch, and pick his nose, was the source of much humor. But it was humor with an edge: Blackburn was mistrusted as a moralistic hatchet man.\\n\\n Blackburn could be charismatic in his speeches, and in private could convey a convincing impression of intellectual honesty for short periods. But within the company he was seen for what he was: a gun for hire, a man with no convictions of his own, and hence the perfect person to be Garvin\u0027s executioner.\\n\\n In earlier years, Sanders and Blackburn had been close friends; not only had they grown up with the company, but their lives were intertwined personally as well: when Blackburn went through his bitter divorce in 1982, he lived for a while in Sanders\u0027s bachelor apartment in\\n\\n Sunnyvale. A few years later, Blackburn had been best man at Sanders\u0027s own wedding to a young Seattle attorney, Susan Handler.\\n\\n But when Blackburn remarried in 1989, Sanders was not invited to the wedding, for by then, their relationship had become strained. Some in the company saw it as inevitable: Blackburn was a part of the inner power circle in Cupertino, to which Sanders, based in Seattle, no longer belonged. In addition, the two men had had sharp disputes about setting up the production lines in Ireland and Malaysia. Sanders felt that Blackburn ignored the inevitable realities of production in foreign countries.\\n\\n Typical was Blackburn\u0027s demand that half the workers on the new line in Kuala Lumpur should be women, and that they should be intermingled with the men; the Malay managers wanted the women segregated, allowed to work only on certain parts of the line, away from the men. Phil strenuously objected. Sanders kept telling him, \"It\u0027s a Muslim country, Phil.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a damn,\" Phil said. \"DigiCom stands for equality.\"\\n\\n \"Phil, it\u0027s their country. They\u0027re Muslim.\"\\n\\n \"So what? It\u0027s our factory.\"\\n\\n Their disagreements went on and on. The Malaysian government didn\u0027t want local Chinese hired as supervisors, although they were the best-qualified; it was the policy of the Malaysian government to train Malays for supervisory jobs. Sanders disagreed with this blatantly discriminatory policy, because he wanted the best supervisors he could get for the plant. But Phil, an outspoken opponent of discrimination in America, immediately acquiesced to the Malay government\u0027s discriminatory policy, saying that DigiCom should embrace a true multicultural perspective. At the last minute, Sanders had had to fly to Kuala Lumpur and meet with the Sultans of Selangor and Pahang, to agree to their demands. Phil then announced that Sanders had \"toadied up to the extremists.\"\\n\\n It was just one of the many controversies that surrounded Sanders\u0027s handling of the new Malaysia factory.\\n\\n Now, Sanders and Blackburn greeted each other with the wariness of former friends who had long since ceased to be anything but superficially cordial. Sanders shook Blackburn\u0027s hand as the company lawyer stepped into the office. \"What\u0027s going on, Phil?\"\\n\\n \"Big day,\" Blackburn said, slipping into the chair facing Sanders\u0027s desk. \"Lot of surprises. I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve heard.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard Garvin has made a decision about the restructuring.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he has. Several decisions.\"\\n\\n There was a pause. Blackburn shifted in his chair and looked at his hands. \"1 know that Bob wanted to fill you in himself about all this. He came by earlier this morning to talk to everyone in the division.\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t here.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. We were all kind of surprised that you were late today.\"\\n\\n Sanders let that pass without comment. He stared at Blackburn, waiting.\\n\\n \"Anyway, Tom,\" Blackburn said, \"the bottom line is this. As part of the overall merger, Bob has decided to go outside the Advanced Products Group for leadership of the division.\"\\n\\n So there it was. Finally, out in the open. Sanders took a deep breath, felt the bands of tightness in his chest. His whole body was tense. But he tried not to show it.\\n\\n \"I know this is something of a shock,\" Blackburn said.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Sanders shrugged. \"I\u0027ve heard rumors.\" Even as he spoke, his mind was racing ahead. It was clear now that there would not be a promotion, there would not be a raise, he would not have a new opportunity to\\n\\n \"Yes. Well,\" Blackburn said, clearing his throat. \"Bob has decided that Meredith Johnson is going to head up the division.\"\\n\\n Sanders frowned. \"Meredith Johnson?\"\\n\\n \"Right. She\u0027s in the Cupertino office. I think you know her.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do, but . . .\" Sanders shook his head. It didn\u0027t make any sense. \"Meredith\u0027s from sales. Her background is in sales.\"\\n\\n \"Originally, yes. But as you know, Meredith\u0027s been in Operations the last couple of years.\"\\n\\n \"Even so, Phil. The APG is a technical division.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not technical. You\u0027ve done just fine.\"\\n\\n \"But I\u0027ve been involved in this for years, when I was in Marketing. Look, the APG is basically programming teams and hardware fabrication lines. How can she run it?\"\\n\\n \"Bob doesn\u0027t expect her to run it directly. She\u0027ll oversee the APG division managers, who will report to her. Meredith\u0027s official title will be Vice President for Advanced Operations and Planning. Under the new structure, that will include the entire APG Division, the Marketing Division, and the TelCom Division.\"\\n\\n `Jesus,\" Sanders said, sitting back in his chair. \"That\u0027s pretty much everything.\"\\n\\n Blackburn nodded slowly.\\n\\n Sanders paused, thinking it over. \"It sounds,\" he said finally, \"like Meredith Johnson\u0027s going to be running this company.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far,\" Blackburn said. \"She won\u0027t have direct control over sales or finance or distribution in this new scheme. But I think there is no question Bob has placed her in direct line for succession, when he steps down as CEO sometime in the next two years.\" Blackburn shifted in his chair. \"But that\u0027s the future. For the present-\"\\n\\n \"Just a minute. She\u0027ll have four APG division managers reporting to her?\" Sanders said.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And who are those managers going to be? Has that been decided?\"\\n\\n \"Well.\" Phil coughed. He ran his hands over his chest, and plucked at the handkerchief in his breast pocket. \"Of course, the actual decision to name the division managers will be Meredith\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Meaning I might not have a job.\"\\n\\n \"Oh hell, Tom,\" Blackburn said. \"Nothing of the sort. Bob wants everyone in the divisions to stay. Including you. He\u0027d hate very much to lose you.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s Meredith Johnson\u0027s decision whether I keep my job.\"\\n\\n \"Technically,\" Blackburn said, spreading his hands, \"it has to be. But I think it\u0027s pretty much pro forma.\"\\n\\n Sanders did not see it that way at all. Garvin could easily have named all the division managers at the same time he named Meredith Johnson to run the APG. If Garvin decided to turn the company over to some woman from Sales, that was certainly his choice. But Garvin could still make sure he kept his division heads in place the heads who had served him and the company so well.\\n\\n `Jesus,\" Sanders said. \"I\u0027ve been with this company twelve years.\"\\n\\n \"And I expect you will be with us many more,\" Blackburn said smoothly. \"Look: it\u0027s in everybody\u0027s interest to keep the teams in place. Because as 1 said, she can\u0027t run them directly.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh.\"\\n\\n Blackburn shot his cuffs and ran his hand through his hair. \"Listen, Tom. I know you\u0027re disappointed that this appointment didn\u0027t come to you. But let\u0027s not make too much of Meredith appointing the division heads. Realistically speaking, she isn\u0027t going to make any changes. Your situation is secure.\" He paused. \"You know the way Meredith is, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"I used to,\" Sanders said, nodding. \"Hell, I lived with her for a while. But I haven\u0027t seen her in years.\"\\n\\n Blackburn looked surprised. \"You two haven\u0027t kept contact?\"\\n\\n \"Not really, no. By the time Meredith joined the company, I was up here in Seattle, and she was based in Cupertino. I ran into her once, on a trip down there. Said hello. That\u0027s about it.\"\\n\\n \"Then you only know her from the old days,\" Blackburn said, as if it all suddenly made sense. \"From six or seven years ago.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s longer than that,\" Sanders said. \"I\u0027ve been in Seattle eight years. So it must be . . .\" Sanders thought back. \"When I was going out with her, she worked for Novell in Mountain View. Selling Ethernet cards to small businesses for local area networks. When was that?\" Although he remembered the relationship with Meredith Johnson vividly, Sanders was hazy about exactly when it had occurred. He tried to recall some memorable event-a birthday, a promotion, an apartment movethat would mark the date. Finally he remembered watching election returns with her on television: balloons rising up toward the ceiling, people cheering. She was drinking beer. That had been early in their relationship. \"Jesus, Phil. It must be almost ten years ago.\"\\n\\n \"That long,\" Blackburn said.\\n\\n When Sanders first met Meredith Johnson, she was one of the thousands of pretty saleswomen working in San Jose-young women in their twenties, not long out of college, who started out doing the product demos on the computer while a senior man stood beside her and did all the talking to the customer. Eventually, a lot of those women learned enough to do the selling themselves. At the time Sanders first knew Meredith, she had acquired enough jargon to rattle on about token rings and 1OBaseT hubs. She didn\u0027t really have any deep knowledge, but she didn\u0027t need to. She was good-looking, sexy, and smart, and she had a kind of uncanny selfpossession that carried her through awkward moments. Sanders had admired her, back in those days. But he never imagined that she had the ability to hold a major corporate position.\\n\\n Blackburn shrugged. \"A lot\u0027s happened in ten years, Tom,\" he said. \"Meredith isn\u0027t just a sales exec. She went back to school, got an MBA. She worked at Symantec, then Conrad, and then she came to work with us. The last couple of years, she\u0027s been working very closely with Garvin. Sort of his protege. He\u0027s been pleased with her work on a number of assignments.\"\\n\\n Sanders shook his head. \"And now she\u0027s my boss . . .\"\\n\\n \"Is that a problem for you?\"\\n\\n \"No. It just seems funny. An old girlfriend as my boss.\"\\n\\n \"The worm turns,\" Blackburn said. He was smiling, but Sanders sensed he was watching him closely. \"You seem a little uneasy about this, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"It takes some getting used to.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a problem? Reporting to a woman?\"\\n\\n \"Not at all. I worked for Eileen when she was head of HRI, and we got along great. It\u0027s not that. It\u0027s just funny to think of Meredith Johnson as my boss.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s an impressive and accomplished manager,\" Phil said. He stood up, smoothed his tie. \"I think when you\u0027ve had an opportunity to become reacquainted, you\u0027ll be very impressed. Give her a chance, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"Of course,\" Sanders said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure everything will work out. And keep your eye on the future. After all, you should be rich in a year or so.\"\\n\\n \"Does that mean we\u0027re still spinning off the APG Division?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes. Absolutely.\"\\n\\n It was a much-discussed part of the merger plan that after Conley-White bought DigiCom, it would spin off the Advanced Products Division and take it public, as a separate company. That would mean enormous profits for everyone in the division. Because everyone would have the chance to buy cheap options before the stock was publicly sold.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re working out the final details now,\" Blackburn said. \"But I expect that division managers like yourself will start with twenty thousand shares vested, and an initial option of fifty thousand shares at twenty-five cents a share, with the right to purchase another fifty thousand shares each year for the next five years.\"\\n\\n \"And the spin-off will go forward, even with Meredith running the divisions?\"\\n\\n \"Trust me. The spin-off will happen within eighteen months. It\u0027s a formal part of the merger plan.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no chance that she may decide to change her mind?\"\\n\\n \"None at all, Tom.\" Blackburn smiled. \"I\u0027ll tell you a little secret. Originally, this spin-off was Meredith\u0027s idea.\"\\n\\n Blackburn left Sanders\u0027s office and went down the hall to an empty office and called Garvin. He heard the familiar sharp bark: \"Garvin here.\"\\n\\n \"I talked to Tom Sanders.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say he took it well. He was disappointed, of course. I think he\u0027d already heard a rumor. But he took it well.\"\\n\\n Garvin said, \"And the new stricture? How did he respond?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s concerned,\" Blackburn said. \"He expressed reservations.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t feel she has the technical expertise to run the division.\" Garvin snorted, \"Technical expertise? That\u0027s the last goddamn thing I care about. Technical expertise is not an issue here.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not. But I think there was some uneasiness on the personal level. You know, they once had a relationship.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Garvin said. \"I know that. Have they talked?\"\\n\\n \"He says, not for several years.\"\\n\\n \"Bad blood?\"\\n\\n \"There didn\u0027t seem to be.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s he concerned about?\"\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s just getting used to the idea.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll come around.\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me if you hear otherwise,\" Garvin said, and hung up.\\n\\n Alone in the office, Blackburn frowned. The conversation with Sanders left him vaguely uneasy. It had seemed to go well enough, and yet . . . Sanders, he felt sure, was not going to take this reorganization lying down. Sanders was popular in the Seattle division, and he could easily cause trouble. Sanders was too independent, he was not a team player, and the company needed team players now. The more Blackburn thought about it, the more certain he was that Sanders was going to be a problem.\\n\\n Tom Sanders sat at his desk, staring forward, lost in thought. He was trying to put together his memory of a pretty young saleswoman in Silicon Valley with this new image of a corporate officer running company divisions, executing the complex groundwork required to take a division public. But his thoughts kept being interrupted by, random images from the past: Meredith smiling, wearing one of his shirts, naked beneath it. An opened suitcase on the bed. White stockings and white garter belt. A bowl of popcorn on the blue couch in the living room. The television with the sound turned off.\\n\\n And for some reason, the image of a dower, a purple iris, in stained glass. It was one of those hackneyed Northern California hippie images. Sanders knew where it came from: it was on the glass of the front door to the apartment where he had lived, back in Sunnyvale. Back in the days when he had known Meredith. He wasn\u0027t sure why he should keep thinking of it now, and he-\\n\\n \"Tom?\"\\n\\n He glanced up. Cindy was standing in the doorway, looking concerned.\\n\\n \"Tom, do you want coffee?\"\\n\\n \"No, thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Don Cherry called again while you were with Phil. He wants you to come and look at the Corridor.\"\\n\\n \"They having problems?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He sounded excited. You want to call him back?\"\\n\\n \"Not right now. I\u0027ll go down and see him in a minute.\"\\n\\n She lingered at the door. \"You want a bagel? Have you had breakfast?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"Sure?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine, Cindy. Really.\"\\n\\n She went away. He turned to look at his monitor, and saw that the icon for his e-mail was blinking. But he was thinking again about Meredith Johnson.\\n\\n Sanders had more or less lived with her for about six months. It had been quite an intense relationship for a while. And yet, although he kept having isolated, vivid images, he realized that in general his memories from that time were surprisingly vague. Had he really lived with Meredith for six months? When exactly had they first met, and when had they broken up? Sanders was surprised at how difficult it was for him to fix the chronology in his mind. Hoping for clarity, he considered other aspects of his life: what had been his position at DigiCom in those days? Was he still working in Marketing, or had he already moved to the technical divisions? He wasn\u0027t sure, now. He would have to look it up in the files.\\n\\n He thought about Blackburn. Blackburn had left his wife and moved in with Sanders around the time Sanders was involved with Meredith. Or was it afterward, when things had gone bad? Maybe Phil had moved into his apartment around the time he was breaking up with Meredith. Sanders wasn\u0027t sure. As he considered it, he realized he wasn\u0027t sure about anything from that time. These events had all happened a decade ago, in another city, at another period in his life, and his memories were in disarray. Again, he was surprised at how confused he was.\\n\\n He pushed the intercom. \"Cindy? I\u0027ve got a question for you.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, Tom.\"\\n\\n \"This is the third week of June. What were you doing the third week of June, ten years ago?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t even hesitate. \"That\u0027s easy: graduating from college.\"\\n\\n Of course that would be true. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Then how about June, nine years ago.\"\\n\\n \"Nine years ago?\" Her voice sounded suddenly cautious, less certain. \"Gee . . . Let\u0027s see, June . . . Nine years ago? . . . June . . . Uh . . . I think I was with my boyfriend in Europe.\"\\n\\n \"Not your present boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"No . . . This guy was a real jerk.\"\\n\\n Sanders said, \"How long did that last?\"\\n\\n \"We were there for a month.\"\\n\\n \"I mean the relationship.\"\\n\\n \"With him? Oh, let\u0027s see, we broke up . . . oh, it must have been. . . uh, December . . . I think it was December, or maybe January, after the holidays . . . Why?\"\\n\\n \"Just trying to figure something out,\" Sanders said. Already he was relieved to hear the uncertain tone of her voice, as she tried to piece together the past. \"By the way, how far back do we have office records? Correspondence, and call books?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have to check. I know I have about three years.\"\\n\\n \"And what about earlier?\"\\n\\n \"Earlier? How much earlier?\"\\n\\n \"Ten years ago,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Gee, that\u0027d be when you were in Cupertino. Do they have that stuff in storage down there? Did they put it on fiche, or was it just thrown out?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"You want me to check?\"\\n\\n \"Not now,\" he said, and clicked off: He didn\u0027t want her making any inquiries in Cupertino now. Not right now.\\n\\n Sanders rubbed his eyes with his fingertips. His thoughts drifting back over time. Again, he saw the stained-glass flower. It was oversize, bright, banal. Sanders had always been embarrassed by the banality of it. In those days, he had lived in one of the apartment complexes on Merano Drive. Twenty units clustered around a chilly little swimming pool. Everybody in the building worked for a high-tech company. Nobody ever went in the pool. And Sanders wasn\u0027t around much. Those were the days when he flew with Garvin to Korea twice a month. The days when they all flew coach. They couldn\u0027t even afford business class.\\n\\n And he remembered how he would come home, exhausted from the long flight, and the first thing he would see when he got to his apartment was that damned stainedglass flower on the door.\\n\\n And Meredith, in those days, was partial to white stockings, a white garter belt, little white flowers on the snaps with\\n\\n \"Tom?\" He looked up. Cindy was at the doorway. She said, \"If you want to see Don Cherry, you\u0027d better go now because you have a ten-thirty with Gary Bosak.\"\\n\\n He felt as if she was treating him like an invalid. \"Cindy, I\u0027m fine.\"\\n\\n \"I know. Just a reminder.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, I\u0027ll go now.\"\\n\\n As he hurried down the stairs to the third floor, he felt relieved at the distraction. Cindy was right to get him out of the office. And he was curious to see what Cherry\u0027s team had done with the Corridor.\\n\\n The Corridor was what everyone at DigiCom called VIE: the Virtual Information Environment. VIE was the companion piece to Twinkle, the second major element in the emerging future of digital information as envisioned by DigiCom. In the future, information was going to be stored on disks, or made available in large databases that users would dial into over telephone lines. At the moment, users saw information displayed on flat screenseither televisions or computer screens. That had been the traditional way of handling information for the last thirty years. But soon, there would be new ways to present information. The most radical, and the most exciting, was virtual environments. Users wore special glasses to see computer-generated, threedimensional environments which allowed them to feel as though they were literally moving through another world. Dozens of high-tech companies were racing to develop virtual environments. It was exciting, but very difficult, technology. At DigiCom, VIE was one of Garvin\u0027s pet projects; he had thrown a lot of money at it; he had had Don Cherry\u0027s programmers working on it around the clock for two years.\\n\\n And so far, it had been nothing but trouble.\\n\\n The sign on the door said \"VIE\" and underneath, \"When Reality Is Not Enough.\" Sanders inserted his card in the slot, and the door clicked open. He passed through an anteroom, hearing a halfdozen voices shouting from the main equipment room beyond. Even in the anteroom, he noticed a distinctly nauseating odor in the air.\\n\\n Entering the main room, he came upon a scene of utter chaos. The windows were thrown wide; there was the astringent smell of cleaning fluid. Most of the programmers were on the floor, working with disassembled equipment. The VIE units lay scattered in pieces, amid a tangle of multicolored cables. Even the black circular walker pads had been taken apart, the rubber bearings being cleaned one by one. Still more wires descended from the ceiling to the laser scanners which were broken open, their circuit boards exposed. Everyone seemed to be talking at once. And in the center of the room, looking like a teenage Buddha in an electric blue T-shirt that said \"Reality Sucks,\" was Don Cherry, the head of Programming. Cherry was twenty-two years old, widely acknowledged to be indispensable, and famous for his impertinence.\\n\\n When he saw Sanders he shouted: \"Out! Out! Damned management! Out!\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" Sanders said. \"I thought you wanted to see me.\"\\n\\n \"Too late! You had your chance!\" Cherry said. \"Now it\u0027s over!\"\\n\\n For a moment, Sanders thought Cherry was referring to the promotion he hadn\u0027t gotten. But Cherry was the most apolitical of the DigiCom division heads, and he was grinning cheerfully as he walked toward Sanders, stepping over his prostrate programmers. \"Sorry, Tom. You\u0027re too late. We\u0027re fine-tuning now.\"\\n\\n \"Fine-tuning? It looks like ground zero here. And what\u0027s that terrible smell?\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Cherry threw up his hands. \"I ask the boys to wash every day, but what can I say. They\u0027re programmers. No better than dogs.\"\\n\\n \"Cindy said you called me several times.\"\\n\\n \"I did,\" Cherry said. \"We had the Corridor up and running, and I wanted you to see it. But maybe it\u0027s just as well you didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Sanders looked at the complex equipment scattered all around him. \"You had it up?\"\\n\\n \"That was then. This is now. Now, we\u0027re fine-tuning.\" Cherry nodded to the programmers on the floor, working on the walker pads. \"We finally got the bug out of the main loop, last night at midnight. The refresh rate doubled. The system really rips now. So we have to adjust the walkers and the servos to update responsiveness. It\u0027s a mechanical problem,\" he said disdainfully. \"But we\u0027ll take care of it anyway.\"\\n\\n The programmers were always annoyed when they had to deal with mechanical problems. Living almost entirely in an abstract world of computer code, they felt that physical machinery was beneath them.\\n\\n Sanders said, \"What is the problem, exactly?\"\\n\\n \"Well, look,\" Cherry said. \"Here\u0027s our latest implementation. The user wears this headset,\" he said, pointing to what looked like thick silver sunglasses. \"And he gets on the walker pad, here.\"\\n\\n The walker pad was one of Cherry\u0027s innovations. The size of a small round trampoline, its surface was composed of tightly packed rubber balls. It functioned like a multidirectional treadmill; walking on the balls, users could move in any direction. \"Once he\u0027s on the walker,\" Cherry said, \"the user dials into a database. Then the computer, over there-\" Cherry pointed to a stack of boxes in the corner, \"takes the information coming from the database and constructs a virtual environment which is projected inside the headset. When the user walks on the pad, the projection changes, so you feel like you\u0027re walking down a corridor lined with drawers of data on all sides. The user can stop anywhere, open any file drawer with his hand, and thumb through data. Completely realistic simulation.\"\\n\\n \"How many users?\"\\n\\n \"At the moment, the system can handle five at one time.\"\\n\\n \"And the Corridor looks like what?\" Sanders said. \"Wire-frame?\" In the earlier versions, the Corridor was outlined in skeletal black-and-white outlines. Fewer lines made it faster for the computer to draw.\\n\\n \"Wire-frame?\" Cherry sniffed. \"Please. We dumped that two weeks ago. Now we are talking 3-D surfaces fully modeled in z4-bit color, with anti-alias texture maps. We\u0027re rendering true curved surfaces-no polygons. Looks completely real.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027re the laser scanners for? I thought you did position by infrared.\" The headsets had infrared sensors mounted above them, so that the system could detect where the user was looking and adjust the projected image inside the headset to match the direction of looking.\\n\\n \"We still do,\" Cherry said. \"The scanners are for body representation.\\n\\n \"Body representation?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Now, if you\u0027re walking down the Corridor with somebody else, you can turn and look at them and you\u0027ll see them. Because the scanners are capturing a three-dimensional texture map in real time: they read body and expression, and draw the virtual face of the virtual person standing beside you in the virtual room. You can\u0027t see the person\u0027s eyes, of course, because they\u0027re hidden by the headset they\u0027re wearing. But the system generates a face from the stored texture map. Pretty slick, huh?\"\\n\\n \"You mean you can see other users?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. See their faces, see their expressions. And that\u0027s not all. If other users in the system aren\u0027t wearing a headset, you can still see them, too. The program identifies other users, pulls their photo out of the personnel file, and pastes it onto a virtual body image. A little kludgey, but not bad.\" Cherry waved his hand in the air. \"And that\u0027s not all. We\u0027ve also built in virtual help.\"\\n\\n \"Virtual help?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, users always need online help. So we\u0027ve made an angel to help you. Floats alongside you, answers your questions.\" Cherry was grinning. \"We thought of making it a blue fairy, but we didn\u0027t want to offend anybody.\"\\n\\n Sanders stared thoughtfully at the room. Cherry was telling him about his successes. But something else was happening here: it was impossible to miss the tension, the frantic energy of the people as they worked.\\n\\n \"Hey, Don,\" one of the programmers shouted. \"What\u0027s the Z-count supposed to be?\"\\n\\n \"Over five,\" Cherry said.\\n\\n \"I got it to four-three.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-3.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ... \\n Thomas Sanders\u0027 world collapses in just 24 hours – he is passed over for promotion, his new woman boss comes on to him during a drink after work, then, the next morning, he learns that she has accused him of sexually harassing her.
