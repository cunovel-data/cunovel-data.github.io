They were out there last week.\" \"I already talked to Colin an hour ago. Operations sent two people out there. For one day. Very polite. Not like this at all.\" \"No inventory?\" \"No inventory.\" \"Okay,\" Sanders said. He sighed. \"Let me get into it.\" \"Tommy boy,\" Eddie said. \"I got to tell you right out. I\u0027m concerned you don\u0027t already know.\" \"Me, too,\" Sanders said. \"Me, too.\" He hung up the phone. Sanders pushed K-A-P for Stephanie Kaplan. She would know what was going on in Austin, and he thought she would tell him. But her assistant said Kaplan was out of the office for the rest of the morning. He called Mary Anne, but she was gore, too. Then he dialed the Four Seasons Hotel, and asked for Max Dorfman. The operator said Mr. Dorfman\u0027s lines were busy. He made a mental note to see Max later in the day. Because if Eddie was right, then Sanders was out of the loop. And that wasn\u0027t good. In the meantime, he could bring up the plant closing with Meredith at the conclusion of the morning meeting with Conley-White. That was the best he could do, for the moment. The prospect of talking to her made him uneasy. But he\u0027d get through it somehow. He didn\u0027t really have a choice. When he got to the fourth-floor conference room, nobody was there. At the far end, a wall board showed a cutaway of the Twinkle drive and a schematic for the Malaysia assembly line. There were notes scribbled on some of the pads, open briefcases beside some of the chairs. The meeting was already under way. Sanders had a sense of panic. He started to sweat. At the far end of the room, an assistant came in, and began moving around the table, setting out glasses and water. \"Where is everybody?\" he asked. \"Oh, they left about fifteen minutes ago,\" she said. \"Fifteen minutes ago? When did they start?\" \"The meeting started at eight.\" \"Eight?\" Sanders said. \"I thought it was supposed to be eight-thirty.\" \"No, the meeting started at eight.\" Damn. \"Where are they now?\" \"Meredith took everybody down to VIE, to demo the Corridor.\" Entering VIE, the first thing Sanders heard was laughter. When he walked into the equipment room, he saw that Don Cherry\u0027s team had two of the Conley-White executives up on the system. John Conley, the young lawyer, and Jim Daly, the investment banker, were both wearing headsets while they walked on the rolling walker pads. The two men were grinning wildly. Everyone else in the room was laughing too, including the normally sour-faced CFO of Conley-White, Ed Nichols, who was standing beside a monitor which showed an image of the virtual corridor that the users were seeing. Nichols had red marks on his forehead from wearing the headset. Nichols looked over as Sanders came up. \"This is fantastic.\" Sanders said, \"Yes, it\u0027s pretty spectacular.\" \"Simply fantastic. It\u0027s going to wipe out all the criticism in New York, once they see this. We\u0027ve been asking Don if he can run this on our own corporate database.\" \"No problem,\" Cherry said. `Just get us the programming hooks for your DB, and we\u0027ll plug you right in. Take us about an hour.\" Nichols pointed to the headset. \"And we can get one of these contraptions in New York?\" \"Easy,\" Cherry said. \"We can ship it out later today. It\u0027ll be there Thursday. I\u0027ll send one of our people to set it up for you.\" \"This is going to be a great selling point,\" Nichols said. `Just great.\" He took out his half-frame glasses. They were a complicated kind of glasses that folded up very small. Nichols unfolded them carefully and put them on his nose. On the walker pad, John Conley was laughing. \"Angel,\" he said. \"How do I open this drawer?\" Then he cocked his head, listening. \"He\u0027s talking to the help angel,\" Cherry said. \"He hears the angel through his earphones.\" \"What\u0027s the angel telling him?\" Nichols said. \"That\u0027s between him and his angel,\" Cherry laughed. On the walker pad, Conley nodded as he listened, then reached forward into the air with his hand. He closed his fingers, as if gripping something, and pulled back, pantomiming someone opening a file drawer. On the monitor, Sanders saw a virtual file drawer slide out from the wall of the corridor. Inside the drawer he saw neatly arranged files. \"Wow,\" Conley said. \"This is amazing. Angel: can I see a file? . . . Oh. Okay.\" Conley reached out and touched one of the file labels with his fingertip. Immediately the file popped out of the drawer and opened up, apparently hanging in midair. \"We have to break the physical metaphor sometimes,\" Cherry said. \"Because users have only one hand. And you can\u0027t open a regular file with one hand.\" Standing on the black walker pad, Conley moved his hand through the air in short arcs, mimicking someone turning pages with his hand. On the monitor, Sanders saw Conley was actually looking at a series of spreadsheets. \"Hey,\" Conley said, \"you people ought to be more careful. I have all your financial records here.\" \"Let me see that,\" Daly said, turning around on the walker pad to look. \"You guys look all you want,\" Cherry laughed. \"Enjoy it while you can. In the final system, we\u0027ll have safeguards built in to control access. But for now, we bypass the entire system. Do you notice that some of the numbers are red? That means they have more detail stored away. Touch one.\" Conley touched a red number. The number zoomed out, creating a new plane of information that hung in the air above the previous spreadsheet. \"Wow!\" \"Kind of a hypertext thing,\" Cherry said, with a shrug. \"Sort of neat, if I say so myself.\" Conley and Daly were giggling, poking rapidly at numbers on the spreadsheet, zooming out dozens of detail sheets that now hung in the air all around them. \"Hey, how do you get rid of all this stuff?\" \"Can you find the original spreadsheet?\" \"It\u0027s hidden behind all this other stuff\" \"Bend over, and look. See if you can get it.\" Conley bent at the waist, and appeared to look under something. He reached out and pinched air. \"I got it.\" \"Okay, now you see a green arrow in the right corner. Touch it.\" Conley touched it. All the papers zoomed back into the original spreadsheet. \"Fabulous!\" \"I want to do it,\" Daly said. \"No, you can\u0027t. I\u0027m going to do it.\" \"No, me!\" \"Me\" They were laughing like delighted kids. Blackburn came up. \"I know this is enjoyable for everyone,\" he said to Nichols, \"but we\u0027re falling behind our schedule and perhaps we ought to go back to the conference room.\" \"All right,\" Nichols said, with obvious reluctance. He turned to Cherry. \"You sure you can get us one of these things?\" \"Count on it,\" Cherry said. \"Count on it.\" Walking back to the conference room, the Conley-White executives were in a giddy mood; they talked rapidly, laughing about the experience. The DigiCom people walked quietly beside them, not wanting to disrupt the good mood. It was at that point that Mark Lewyn fell into step alongside Sanders and whispered, \"Hey, why didn\u0027t you call me last night?\" \"I did,\" Sanders said. Lewyn shook his head. \"There wasn\u0027t any message when I got home,\" he said. \"I talked to your answering machine, about six-fifteen.\" \"I never got a message,\" Lewyn said. \"And then when I came in this morning, you weren\u0027t here.\" He lowered his voice. \"Christ. What a mess. I had to go into the meeting on Twinkle with no idea what the approach was going to be.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Sanders said. \"I don\u0027t know what happened.\" \"Fortunately, Meredith took over the discussion,\" Lewyn said. \"Otherwise I would have been in deepest shit. In fact, I-We\u0027ll do this later,\" he said, seeing Johnson drop back to talk to Sanders. Lewyn stepped away. \"Where the hell were you?\"Johnson said. \"I thought the meeting was for eight-thirty.\" \"I called your house last night, specifically because it was changed to eight. They\u0027re trying to catch a plane to Austin for the afternoon. So we moved everything up.\" \"I didn\u0027t get that message.\" \"I talked to your wife. Didn\u0027t she tell you?\" \"I thought it was eight-thirty.\" Johnson shook her head, as if dismissing the whole thing. \"Anyway,\" she said, \"in the eight o\u0027clock session, I had to take another approach to Twinkle, and it\u0027s very important that we have some coordination in the light of-\" \"Meredith?\" Up at the front of the group, Garvin was looking back at her. \"Meredith, John has a question for you.\" \"Be right there,\" she said. With a final angry frown at Sanders, she hurried up to the head of the group. Back in the conference room, the mood was light. They were all still joking as they took their seats. Ed Nichols began the meeting by turning to Sanders. \"Meredith\u0027s been bringing us up to date on the Twinkle drive. Now that you\u0027re here, we\u0027d like your assessment as well.\" I had to take another approach to Twinkle, Meredith had said. Sanders hesitated. \"My assessment?\" \"Yes,\" Nichols said. \"You\u0027re in charge of Twinkle, aren\u0027t you?\" Sanders looked at the faces around the table, turned expectantly toward him. He glanced at Johnson, but she had opened her briefcase and was rummaging through her papers, taking out several bulging manila envelopes. \"Well,\" Sanders said. \"We built several prototypes and tested them thoroughly. There\u0027s no doubt that the prototypes performed flawlessly. They\u0027re the best drives in the world.\" \"I understand that,\" Nichols said. \"But now you are in production, isn\u0027t that right?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"I think we\u0027re more interested in your assessment of the production.\" Sanders hesitated. What had she told them? At the other end of the room, Meredith Johnson closed her briefcase, folded her hands under her chin, and stared steadily at him. He could not read her expression. What had she told them? \"Mr. Sanders?\" \"Well,\" Sanders began, \"we\u0027ve been shaking out the lines, dealing with the problems as they arise. It\u0027s a pretty standard start-up experience for us. We\u0027re still in the early stages.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Nichols said. \"I thought you\u0027ve been in production for two months.\" \"Yes, that\u0027s true.\" \"Two months doesn\u0027t sound like `the early stages\u0027 to me.\" \"Well-\" \"Some of your product cycles are as short as nine months, isn\u0027t that right?\" \"Nine to eighteen months, yes.\" \"Then after two months, you must be in full production. How do you assess that, as the principal person in charge?\" \"Well, I\u0027d say the problems are of the order of magnitude we generally experience at this point.\" \"I\u0027m interested to hear that,\" Nichols said, \"because earlier today, Meredith indicated to us that the problems were actually quite serious. She said you might even have to go back to the drawing board.\" Shit. How should he play it now? He\u0027d already said that the problems were not so bad. He couldn\u0027t back down. Sanders took a breath and said, \"I hope I haven\u0027t conveyed the wrong impression to Meredith. Because I have full confidence in our ability to manufacture the Twinkle drive.\" \"I\u0027m sure you do,\" Nichols said. \"But we\u0027re looking down the barrel at competition from Sony and Philips, and I\u0027m not sure that a simple expression of your confidence is adequate. How many of the drives coming off the line meet specifications?\" \"I don\u0027t have that information.\" \"Just approximately.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t want to say, without precise figures.\" \"Are precise figures available?\" \"Yes. I just don\u0027t have them at hand.\" Nichols frowned. His expression said: why don\u0027t you have them when you knew this is what the meeting was about? Conley cleared his throat. \"Meredith indicated that the line is running at twenty-nine percent capacity, and that only five percent of the drives meet specifications. Is that your understanding?\" \"That\u0027s more or less how it has been. Yes.\" There was a brief silence around the table. Abruptly, Nichols sat forward. \"I\u0027m afraid I need some help here,\" he said. \"With figures like that, on what do you base your confidence in the Twinkle drive?\" \"The reason is that we\u0027ve seen all this before,\" Sanders replied. \"We\u0027ve seen production problems that look insurmountable but then get resolved quickly.\" \"I see. So you think your past experience will hold true here.\" \"Yes, I do.\" Nichols sat back in his seat and crossed his arms over his chest. He looked extremely dissatisfied. Jim Daly, the thin investment banker, sat forward and said, \"Please don\u0027t misunderstand, Tom. We\u0027re not trying to put you on the spot,\" he said. \"We have long ago identified several reasons for acquisition of this company, irrespective of any specific problem with Twinkle. So I don\u0027t think Twinkle is a critical issue today. We just want to know where we stand on it. And we\u0027d like you to be as frank as possible.\" \"Well, there are problems,\" Sanders said. \"We\u0027re in the midst of assessing them now. We have some ideas. But some of the problems may go back to design.\" Daly said, \"Give us worst case.\" \"Worst case? We pull the line, rework the housings and perhaps the controller chips, and then go back on.\" \"Causing a delay of?\" Nine to twelve months. \"Up to six months,\" Sanders said. `Jesus,\" somebody whispered. Daly said, `Johnson suggested that the maximum delay would be six weeks.\" \"I hope that\u0027s right. But you asked for worst case.\" \"Do you really think it will take six months?\" \"You asked for worst case. I think it\u0027s unlikely.\" \"But possible?\" \"Yes, possible.\" Nichols sat forward again and gave a big sigh. \"Let me see if I understand this right. If there are design problems with the drive, they occurred under your stewardship, is that correct?\" \"Yes, it is.\" Nichols shook his head. \"Well. Having gotten us into this mess, do you really think you\u0027re the person to clean it up?\" Sanders suppressed a surge of anger. \"Yes I do,\" he said. \"In fact, I think I\u0027m the best possible person to do it. As I said, we\u0027ve seen this kind of situation before. And we\u0027ve handled it before. I\u0027m close to all the people involved. And I am sure we can resolve it.\" He wondered how he could explain to these people in suits the reality of how products were made. \"When you\u0027re working the cycles,\" he said, \"it\u0027s sometimes not so serious to go back to the boards. Nobody likes to do it, but it may have advantages. In the old days, we made a complete generation of new products every year or so. Now, more and more, we also make incremental changes within generations. If we have to redo the chips, we may be able to code in the video compression algorithms, which weren\u0027t available when we started. That will enhance the end-user perception of speed by more than the simple drive specs. We won\u0027t go back to build a hundred-millisecond drive. We\u0027ll go back to build an eighty-millisecond drive.\" \"But,\" Nichols said, \"in the meantime, you won\u0027t have entered the market.\" \"No, that\u0027s true.\" \"You won\u0027t have established your brand name, or established market share for your product stream. You won\u0027t have your dealerships, or your OEMs, or your ad campaign, because you won\u0027t have a product line to support it. You may have a better drive, but it\u0027ll be an unknown drive. You\u0027ll be starting from scratch.\" \"All true. But the market responds fast.\" \"And so does the competition. Where will Sony be by the time you get to market? Will they be at eighty milliseconds, too?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Sanders said. Nichols sighed. \"I wish I had more confidence about where we are on this thing. To say nothing of whether we\u0027re properly staffed to fix it.\" Meredith spoke for the first time. \"I may be a little bit at fault here,\" she said. \"When you and I spoke about Twinkle, Tom, I understood you to say that the problems were quite serious.\" \"They are, yes.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t think we want to be covering anything up here.\" He said quickly, \"I\u0027m not covering anything up.\" The words came out almost before he realized it. He heard his voice, high-pitched, tight. \"No, no,\" Meredith said soothingly. \"I didn\u0027t mean to suggest you were. It\u0027s just that these technical issues are hard for some of us to grasp. We\u0027re looking for a translation into layman\u0027s terms of just where we are. If you can do that for us.\" \"I\u0027ve been trying to do that,\" he said. He knew he sounded defensive. But he couldn\u0027t help it. \"Yes, Tom, I know you have,\" Meredith said, her voice still soothing. \"But for example: if the laser read-write heads are cut of sync with the m-subset instructions off the controller chip, what is that going to mean for us, in terms of down time?\" She was just grandstanding, demonstrating her facility with techtalk, but her words threw him off balance anyway. Because the laser heads were read-only, not readwrite, and they had nothing to do with the m-subset off the controller chip. The position controls all came off the x-subset. And the x-subset was licensed code from Sony, part of the driver code that every company used in their CD drives. To answer without embarrassing her, he had to move into fantasy, where nothing he could say was true. \"Well,\" he said, \"you raise a good point, Meredith. But I think the m-subset should be a relatively simple problem, assuming the laser heads are tracking to tolerance. Perhaps three or four days to fix.\" He glanced quickly at Cherry and Lewyn, the only people in the room who would know that Sanders had just spoken gibberish. Both men nodded sagely as they listened. Cherry even rubbed his chin. Johnson said, \"And do you anticipate a problem with the asynchronous tracking signals from the mother board?\" Again, she was mixing everything up. The tracking signals came from the power source, and were regulated by the controller chip. There wasn\u0027t a mother board in the drive units. But by now he was in the swing. He answered quickly: \"That\u0027s certainly a consideration, Meredith, and we should check it thoroughly. I expect we\u0027ll find that the asynchronous signals may be phase-shifted, but nothing more than that.\" \"A phase-shift is easy to repair?\" \"Yes, I think so.\" Nichols cleared his throat. \"I feel this is an in-house technical issue,\" he said. \"Perhaps we should move on to other matters. What\u0027s next on the agenda?\" Garvin said, \"We\u0027ve scheduled a demo of the video compression just down the hall.\" \"Fine. Let\u0027s do that.\" Chairs scraped back. Everyone stood up, and they filed out of the room. Meredith was slower to close up her files. Sanders stayed behind for a moment, too. When they were alone he said, \"What the hell was all that about?\" \"All what?\" \"All that gobbledygook about controller chips and read heads. You don\u0027t know what you were talking about.\" \"Oh Yes I do,\" she said angrily. \"I was fixing the mess that you made.\" She leaned over the table and glared at him. \"Look, Tom. I decided to take your advice last night, and tell the truth about the drive. This morning I said there were severe problems with it, that you were very knowledgeable, and you would tell them what the problems were. I set it up, for you to say what you told me you wanted to say. But then you came in and announced there were no problems of significance.\" \"But I thought we agreed last night-\" \"These men aren\u0027t fools, and we\u0027re not going to be able to fool them.\" She snapped her briefcase shut. \"I reported in good faith what you told me. And then you said I didn\u0027t know what I was talking about.\" He bit his lip, trying to control his anger. \"I don\u0027t know what you think is going on here,\" she said. \"These men don\u0027t care about technical details. They wouldn\u0027t know a drive head from a dildo. They\u0027re just looking to see if anybody\u0027s in charge, if anybody has a handle on the problems. They want reassurance. And you didn\u0027t reassure them. So I had to jump in and fix it with a lot of techno-bullshit. I had to clean up after you. I did the best I could. But let\u0027s face it: you didn\u0027t inspire confidence today, Tom. Not at all.\" \"Goddamn it,\" he said. \"You\u0027re just talking about appearances. Corporate appearances in a corporate meeting. But in the end somebody has to actually build the damn drive-\" \"I\u0027ll say-\" \"And I\u0027ve been running this division for eight years, and running it damn well-\" \"Meredith.\" Garvin stuck his head in the door. They both stopped talking. \"We\u0027re waiting, Meredith,\" he said. He turned and looked coldly at Sanders. She picked up her briefcase and swept out of the room. Sanders went immediately downstairs to Blackburn\u0027s office. \"I need to see Phil.\" Sandra, his assistant, sighed. \"He\u0027s pretty busy today.\" \"I need to see him now.\" \"Let me check, Tom.\" She buzzed the inner office. \"Phil? It\u0027s Tom Sanders.\" She listened a moment. \"He says go right in.\" Sanders went into Blackburn\u0027s office and closed the door. Blackburn stood up behind his desk and ran his hands down his chest. \"Tom. I\u0027m glad you came down.\" They shook hands briefly. \"It isn\u0027t working out with Meredith,\" Sanders said at once. He was still angry from his encounter with her. \"Yes, I know.\" \"I don\u0027t think I can work with her.\" Blackburn nodded. \"I know. She already told me.\" \"Oh? What\u0027d she tell you?\" \"She told me about the meeting last night, Tom.\" Sanders frowned. He couldn\u0027t imagine that she had discussed that meeting. \"Last night?\" \"She told me that you sexually harassed her.\" \"I what.\" \"Now, Tom, don\u0027t get excited. Meredith\u0027s assured me she\u0027s not going to press charges. We can handle it quietly, in house. That will be best for everyone. In fact, I\u0027ve just been going over the organization charts, and-\" \"Wait a minute,\" Sanders said. \"She\u0027s saying I harassed her?\" Blackburn stared at him. \"Tom. We\u0027ve been friends a long time. I can assure you, this doesn\u0027t have to be a problem. It doesn\u0027t have to get around the company. Your wife doesn\u0027t need to know. As I said, we can handle this quietly. To the satisfaction of everyone involved.\" \"Wait a minute, it\u0027s not true-\" \"Tom, just give me a minute here, please. The most important thing now is for us to separate the two of you. So you aren\u0027t reporting to her. I think a lateral promotion for you would be ideal.\" \"Lateral promotion?\" \"Yes. There\u0027s an opening for technical vice president in the cellular division in Austin. I want to transfer you there. You\u0027ll go with the same seniority, salary, and benefit package. Everything the same, except you\u0027ll be in Austin and you won\u0027t have to have any direct contact with her. How does that sound?\" \"Austin.\" \"Yes.\" \"Cellular.\" \"Yes. Beautiful weather, nice working conditions . . . university town . . . chance to get your family out of this rain . . .\" Sanders said, \"But Conley\u0027s going to sell off Austin.\" Blackburn sat down behind his desk. \"I can\u0027t imagine where you heard that, Tom,\" he said calmly. \"It\u0027s completely untrue.\" \"You sure about that?\" \"Absolutely. Believe me, selling Austin is the last thing they\u0027d do. Why, it makes no sense at all.\" \"They why are they inventorying the plant?\" \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027re going over the whole operation with a fine-tooth comb. Look, Tom. Conley\u0027s worried about cash flow after the acquisition, and the Austin plant is, as you know, very profitable. We\u0027ve given them the figures. Now they\u0027re verifying them, making sure they\u0027re real. But there\u0027s no chance they would sell it. Cellular is only going to grow, Tom. You know that. And that\u0027s why I think a vice presidency there in Austin is an excellent career opportunity for you to consider.\" \"But I\u0027d be leaving the Advanced Products Division?\" \"Well, yes. The whole point would be to move you out of this division.\" \"And then I wouldn\u0027t be in the new company when it spins off.\" \"That\u0027s true.\" Sanders paced back and forth. \"That\u0027s completely unacceptable.\" \"Well, let\u0027s not be hasty,\" Blackburn said. \"Let\u0027s consider all the ramifications.\" \"Phil,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know what she told you, but-\" \"She told me the whole story-\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-9.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ...
