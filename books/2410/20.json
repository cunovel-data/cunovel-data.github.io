They all got out.\n \"All right,\" Fernandez said. \"Let\u0027s see where we are with her significant others. Alan. We\u0027ve still got her previous employer-\"\n \"Conrad Computer. Right. We\u0027re on it.\n \"And also the one before that.\"\n \"Symantec.\"\n \"Yes. And we have her husband-\"\n \"I\u0027ve got a call into CoStar for him.\"\n \"And the Internet business? `Afriend\u0027?\"\n \"Working on it.\"\n \"And we have her B-school, and Vassar.\"\n \"Right.\"\n \"Recent history is the most important. Focus on Conrad and the husband.\"\n \"Okay,\" Alan said. \"Conrad\u0027s a problem, because they supply systems to the government and the CIA. They gave me some song and dance about neutral reference policy and nondisclosure of prior employees.\"\n \"Then get Harry to call them. He\u0027s good on negligent referral. He can shake them up if they continue to stonewall.\"\n \"Okay. He may have to.\"\n Alan got back in the car. Fernandez and Sanders started walking up to the mediation center. Sanders said, \"You\u0027re checking her past companies?\"\n \"Yes. Other companies don\u0027t like to give damaging information on prior employees. For years, they would never give anything at all except the dates of employment. But now there\u0027s something called compelled self-publication, and something called negligent referral. A company can be liable now for failing to reveal a problem with a past employee. So we can try to scare them. But in the end, they may not give us the damaging information we want.\"\n \"How do you know they have damaging information to give?\"\n Fernandez smiled. \"Because Johnson is a harasser. And with harassers, there\u0027s always a pattern. It\u0027s never the first time.\"\n \"You think she\u0027s done this before?\"\n \"Don\u0027t sound so disappointed,\" Fernandez said. \"What did you think? That she did all this because she thought you were so cute? I guarantee you she has done it before.\" They walked past the fountains in the courtyard toward the door to the center building. \"And now,\" Fernandez said, \"let\u0027s go cut Ms. Johnson to shreds.\"\n Precisely at one-thirty, judge Murphy entered the mediation room. She looked at the seven silent people sitting around the table and frowned. \"Has opposing counsel met?\"\n \"We have,\" Heller said.\n \"With what result?\" Murphy said.\n \"We have failed to reach a settlement,\" Heller said.\n \"Very well. Let\u0027s resume.\" She sat down and opened her notepad. \"Is there further discussion relating to the morning session?\"\n \"Yes, Your Honor,\" Fernandez said. \"I have some additional questions for Ms. Johnson.\"\n \"Very well. Ms. Johnson?\"\n Meredith Johnson put on her glasses. \"Actually, Your Honor, I would like to make a statement first.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"I\u0027ve been thinking about the morning session,\" Johnson said, speaking slowly and deliberately, \"and Mr. Sanders\u0027s account of the events of Monday night. And I\u0027ve begun to feel that there may be a genuine misunderstanding here.\"\n \"I see.\" Judge Murphy spoke absolutely without inflection. She stared at Meredith. \"All right.\"\n \"When Tom first suggested a meeting at the end of the day, and when he suggested that we have some wine, and talk over old times, I\u0027m afraid I may have unconsciously responded to him in a way that he might not have intended.\"\n Judge Murphy didn\u0027t move. Nobody was moving. The room was completely still.\n \"I believe it is correct to say that I took him at his word, and began to imagine a, uh, romantic interlude. And to be frank, I was not opposed to that possibility. Mr. Sanders and I had a very special relationship some years ago, and I remembered it as a very exciting relationship. So I believe it is fair to say that I was looking forward to our meeting, and that perhaps I presumed that it would lead to an encounter. Which I was, unconsciously, quite willing to have occur.\"\n Alongside Meredith, Heller and Blackburn sat completely stonefaced, showing no reaction at all. The two female attorneys showed no reaction. This had all been worked out in advance, Sanders realized. What was going on? Why was she changing her story?\n Johnson cleared her throat, then continued in the same deliberate way. \"I believe it is correct to say that I was a willing participant in all the events of the evening. And it may be that I was too forward, at one point, for Mr. Sanders\u0027s taste. In the heat of the moment, I may have overstepped the bounds of propriety and my position in the company. I think that\u0027s possible. After serious reflection, I find myself concluding that my own recollection of events and Mr. Sanders\u0027s recollection of events are in much closer agreement than I had earlier recognized.\"\n There was a long silence. Judge Murphy said nothing. Meredith Johnson shifted in her chair, took her glasses off, then put them back on again.\n \"Ms. Johnson,\" Murphy said finally, \"do I understand you to say that you are now agreeing to Mr. Sanders\u0027s version of the events on Monday night?\"\n \"In many respects, yes. Perhaps in most respects.\"\n Sanders suddenly realized what had happened: they knew about the tape.\n But how could they know? Sanders himself had learned of it only two hours ago. And Levin had been out of his office, having lunch with them. So Levin couldn\u0027t have told them. How could they know?\n \"And, Ms. Johnson,\" Murphy said, \"are you also agreeing to the charge of harassment by Mr. Sanders?\"\n \"Not at all, Your Honor. No.\"\n \"Then I\u0027m not sure I understand. You\u0027ve changed your story. You say you now agree that Mr. Sanders\u0027s version of the events is correct in most respects. But you do not agree that he has a claim against you?\"\n \"No, Your Honor. As I said, I think it was all a misunderstanding.\"\n \"A misunderstanding,\" Murphy repeated, with an incredulous look on her face.\n \"Yes, Your Honor. And one in which Mr. Sanders played a very active role.\"\n \"Ms, . Johnson. According to Mr. Sanders, you initiated kissing over his protests; you pushed him down on the couch over his protests; you unzipped his trousers and removed his penis over his protests; and you removed your own clothing over his protests. Since Mr. Sanders is your employee, and dependent on you for employment, it is difficult for me to comprehend why this is not a clear-cut and indisputable case of sexual harassment on your part.\"\n \"I understand, Your Honor,\" Meredith Johnson said calmly. \"And I realize I have changed my story. But the reason I say it is a misunderstanding is that from the beginning, I genuinely believed that Mr. Sanders was seeking a sexual encounter with me, and that belief guided my actions.\"\n \"You do not agree that you harassed him.\"\n \"No, Your Honor. Because I thought I had clear physical indications that Mr. Sanders was a willing participant. At times he certainly took the lead. So now, I have to ask myself why he would take the lead-and then so suddenly withdraw. I don\u0027t know why he did that. But I believe he shares responsibility for what happened. That is why I feel that, at the very least, we had a genuine misunderstanding. And I want to say that I am sorry truly, deeply sorry-for my part in this misunderstanding.\"\n \"You\u0027re sorry.\" Murphy looked around the room in exasperation. \"Can anyone explain to me what is going on? Mr. Heller?\"\n Heller spread his hands. \"Your Honor, my client told me what she intended to do here. I consider it a very brave act. She is a true seeker after truth.\"\n \"Oh, spare me,\" Fernandez said.\n Judge Murphy said, \"Ms. Fernandez, considering this radically different statement from Ms. Johnson, would you like a recess before you proceed with your questions?\"\n \"No, Your Honor. I am prepared to go forward now,\" Fernandez said.\n \"I see,\" Murphy said, puzzled. \"All right. Fine.\" Judge Murphy clearly felt that there was something everyone else in the room knew that she didn\u0027t.\n Sanders was still wondering how Meredith knew about the tape. He looked over at Phil Blackburn, who sat at one end of the table, his cellular phone before him. He was rubbing the phone nervously.\n Phone records, Sanders thought. That must be it.\n DigiCom would have had somebody-most probably Gary Bosak-going through all of Sanders\u0027s records, looking for things to use against him. Bosak would have checked all the calls made on Sanders\u0027s cellular phone. When he did that, he would have discovered a call that lasted forty-five minutes on Monday night. It would stand out: a whopping big duration and charge. And Bosak must have looked at the time of the call and figured out what had happened. He\u0027d realize that Sanders hadn\u0027t been talking on the phone during that particular forty-five minutes on Monday night. Therefore, there could only be one explanation. The call was running to an answering machine, which meant there was a tape. And Johnson knew it, and had adjusted her story accordingly. That was what had made her change.\n \"Ms. Johnson,\" Fernandez said. \"Let\u0027s clear up a few factual points first. Are you now saying that you did send your assistant to buy wine and condoms, that you did tell her to lock the door, and that you did cancel your seven o\u0027clock appointment in anticipation of a sexual encounter with Mr. Sanders?\"\n \"Yes, I did.\"\n \"In other words, you lied earlier.\"\n \"I presented my point of view.\"\n \"But we are not talking about a point of view. We are talking about facts. And given this set of facts, I\u0027m curious to know why you feel that Mr. Sanders shares responsibility for what happened in that room Monday night.\"\n \"Because I felt . . . I felt that Mr. Sanders had come to my office with the clear intention of having sex with me, and he later denied any such intention. I felt he had set me up. He led me on, and then accused me, when I had done nothing more than simply respond to him.\"\n \"You feel he set you up?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And that\u0027s why you feel he shares responsibility?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"In what way did he set you up?\"\n \"Well, I think it\u0027s obvious. Things had gone very far along, when he suddenly got off the couch and said he was not going to proceed. I\u0027d say that was a setup.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because you can\u0027t go so far and then just stop. That\u0027s obviously ahostile act, intended to embarrass and humiliate me. I mean . . . anyone can see that.\"\n \"All right. Let\u0027s review that particular moment in detail,\" Fernandez said. \"As I understand it, we\u0027re talking about the time when you were on the couch with Mr. Sanders, with both of you in a state of partial undress. Mr. Sanders was crouched on his knees on the couch, his penis was exposed, and you were lying on your back with your panties removed and your legs spread, is that correct?\"\n \"Basically. Yes.\" She shook her head. \"You make it sound so . . . crude.\"\n \"But that was the situation at that moment, was it not?\"\n \"Yes. It was.\"\n \"Now, at that moment, did you say, `No, no, please,\u0027 and did Mr. Sanders reply, `You\u0027re right, we shouldn\u0027t be doing this,\u0027 and then get off the couch?\"\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what he said.\"\n \"Then what was the misunderstanding?\"\n \"When I said, `No, no,\u0027 I meant, `No, don\u0027t wait.\u0027 Because he was waiting, sort of teasing me, and I wanted him to go ahead. Instead, he got off the couch, which made me very angry.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because I wanted him to do it.\"\n \"But Ms. Johnson, you said, `No, no.\u0027\"\n \"I know what I said,\" she replied irritably, \"but in that situation, it\u0027s perfectly clear what I was really saying to him.\"\n \"Is it?\"\n \"Of course. He knew exactly what I was saying to him, but he chose to ignore it.\"\n \"Ms. Johnson, have you ever heard the phrase, `No means no\u0027?\"\n \"Of course, but in this situation-\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Ms. Johnson. Does no mean no, or not?\"\n \"Not in this case. Because at that time, lying on that couch, it was absolutely clear what I was really saying to him.\"\n \"You mean it was clear to you.\"\n Johnson became openly angry. \"It was clear to him, too,\" she snapped.\n \"Ms. Johnson. When men are told that `no means no,\u0027 what does that mean?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" She threw up her hands in irritation. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re trying to say.\"\n \"I\u0027m trying to say that men are being told that they must take women at their literal word. That no means no. That men cannot assume that no means maybe or yes.\"\n \"But in this particular situation, with all our clothes off, when things had gone so far-\"\n \"What does that have to do with it?\" Fernandez said.\n \"Oh, come off it,\"Johnson said. \"When people are getting together, they begin with little touches, then little kisses, then a little petting, then some more petting. Then the clothes come off, and you\u0027re touching various private parts, and so on. And pretty soon you have an expectation about what\u0027s going to happen. And you don\u0027t turn back. To turn back is a hostile act. That\u0027s what he did. He set me up.\"\n \"Ms. Johnson. Isn\u0027t it true that women claim the right to turn back at any point, up to the moment of actual penetration? Don\u0027t women claim the unequivocal right to change their minds?\"\n \"Yes, but in this instance\"\n \"Ms. Johnson. If women have the right to change their minds, don\u0027t men as well? Can\u0027t Mr. Sanders change his mind?\"\n \"It was a hostile act.\" Her face had a fixed, stubborn look. \"He set me up.\"\n \"I\u0027m asking whether Mr, Sanders has the same rights as a woman in this situation. Whether he has the right to withdraw, even at the last moment.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because men are different.\"\n \"How are they different?\"\n \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" Johnson said angrily. \"What are we talking about here? This is Alice in Wonderland. Men and women are different. Everybody knows that. Men can\u0027t control their impulses.\"\n \"Apparently Mr. Sanders could.\"\n \"Yes. As a hostile act. Out of his desire to humiliate me.\"\n \"But what Mr. Sanders actually said at the time was, `I don\u0027t feel good about this.\u0027 Isn\u0027t that true?\"\n \"I don\u0027t remember his exact words. But his behavior was very hostile and degrading toward me as a woman.\"\n \"Let\u0027s consider,\" Fernandez said, \"who was hostile and degrading toward whom. Didn\u0027t Mr. Sanders protest the way things were going earlier in the evening?\"\n \"Not really. No.\"\n \"I thought he had.\" Fernandez looked at her notes. \"Early on, did you say to Mr. Sanders, `You look good\u0027 and `You always had a nice hard tush\u0027?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I might have. I don\u0027t remember.\"\n \"And what did he reply?\"\n \"I don\u0027t remember.\"\n Fernandez said, \"Now, when Mr. Sanders was talking on the phone, did you come up, push it out of his hand, and say, `Forget that phone\u0027?\"\n \"I might have. I don\u0027t really remember.\"\n \"And did you initiate kissing at that point?\"\n \"I\u0027m not really sure. I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s see. How else could it have occurred? Mr. Sanders was talking on his cellular phone, over by the window. You were on another phone at your desk. Did he interrupt his call, set down his phone, come over, and start kissing you?\"\n She paused for a moment. \"No.\"\n \"Then who initiated the kissing?\"\n \"I guess I did.\"\n \"And when he protested and said, `Meredith,\u0027 did you ignore him, press on, and say, `God, I\u0027ve wanted you all day. I\u0027m so hot, I haven\u0027t had a decent fuck\u0027?\" Fernandez repeated these statements in a flat uninflected monotone, as if reading from a transcript.\n \"I may have . . . I think that might be accurate. Yes.\"\n Fernandez looked again at her notes. \"And then, when he said, `Meredith, wait,\u0027 again clearly speaking in a tone of protest, did you say, `Oh, don\u0027t talk, no, no, oh Jesus\u0027?\"\n \"I think . . . possibly I did.\"\n \"On reflection, would you say these comments by Mr. Sanders were protests that you ignored?\"\n \"If they were, they were not very clear protests. No.\"\n \"Ms. Johnson. Would you characterize Mr. Sanders as fully enthusiastic throughout the encounter?\"\n Johnson hesitated a moment. Sanders could almost see her thinking, trying to decide how much the tape would reveal. Finally she said, \"He was enthusiastic sometimes, not so much at other times. That\u0027s my point.\"\n \"Would you say he was ambivalent?\"\n \"Possibly. Somewhat.\"\n \"Is that a yes or a no, Ms. Johnson?\" Yes.\n \"All right. So Mr. Sanders was ambivalent throughout the session. He\u0027s told us why: because he was being asked to embark on an office affair with an old girlfriend who was now his boss. And because he was now married. Would you consider those valid reasons for ambivalence?\"\n \"I suppose so.\"\n \"And in this state of ambivalence, Mr. Sanders was overwhelmed at the last moment with the feeling that he didn\u0027t want to go forward. And he told you how he felt, simply and directly. So, why would you characterize that as a `setup\u0027? I think we have ample evidence that it is just the opposite an uncalculated, rather desperate human response to a situation which you entirely controlled. This was not a reunion of old lovers, Ms. Johnson, though you prefer to think it was. This was not a meeting of equals at all. The fact is, you are his superior and you controlled every aspect of the meeting. You arranged the time, bought the wine, bought the condoms, locked the door-and then you blamed your employee when he failed to please you. That is how you continue to behave now.\"\n \"And you\u0027re trying to put his behavior in a good light,\" Johnson said. \"But what I\u0027m saying is that as a practical matter, waiting to the last minute to stop makes people very angry.\"\n \"Yes,\" Fernandez said. \"That\u0027s how many men feel, when women withdraw at the last minute. But women say a man has no right to be angry, because a woman can withdraw at any time. Isn\u0027t that true?\"\n Johnson rapped her fingers on the table irritably. \"Look,\" she said. \"You\u0027re trying to make some kind of federal case here, by trying to obscure basic facts. What did I do that was so wrong? I made him an offer, that\u0027s all. If Mr. Sanders wasn\u0027t interested, all he had to do was say, `No.\u0027 But he never said that. Not once. Because he intended to set me up. He\u0027s angry he didn\u0027t get the job and he\u0027s retaliating the only way he can-by smearing me. This is nothing but guerrilla warfare and character assassination. I\u0027m a successful woman in business, and he resents my success and he\u0027s out to get me. You\u0027re saying all kinds of things to avoid that central and unavoidable fact.\"\n \"Ms. Johnson. The central and unavoidable fact is that you\u0027re Mr. Sanders\u0027s superior. And your behavior toward him was illegal. And it is in fact a federal case.\"\n There was a short silence.\n Blackburn\u0027s assistant came into the room and handed him a note. Blackburn read the note and passed it to Heller.\n Murphy said, \"Ms. Fernandez? Are you ready to explain what\u0027s going on to me now?\"\n \"Yes, Your Honor. It turns out there is an audio tape of the meeting.\"\n \"Really? Have you heard it?\"\n \"I have, Your Honor. It confirms Mr. Sanders\u0027s story.\"\n \"Are you aware of this tape, Ms. Johnson?\"\n \"No, I am not.\"\n \"Perhaps Ms. Johnson and her attorney would like to hear it, too. Perhaps we should all hear it,\" Murphy said, looking directly at Blackburn.\n Heller put the note in his pocket and said, \"Your Honor, I\u0027d like to request a ten-minute recess.\"\n \"Very well, Mr. Heller. I\u0027d say this development warrants it.\"\n Outside in the courtyard, black clouds hung low. It was threatening to rain again. Over by the fountains, Johnson huddled with Heller and Blackburn. Fernandez watched them. \"I just don\u0027t understand this,\" she said. \"There they all are, talking again. What is there to talk about? Their client lied, and then changed her story. There\u0027s no question that Johnson\u0027s guilty of sexual harassment. We have it recorded on tape. So what are they talking about?\"\n Fernandez stared for a moment, frowning. \"You know, I have to admit it. Johnson\u0027s a hell of a smart woman,\" she said.\n \"Yes,\" Sanders said.\n \"She\u0027s quick and she\u0027s cool.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Moved up the corporate ladder fast.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"So . . . how\u0027d she let herself get into this situation?\"\n \"What do you mean?\" Sanders said.\n \"I mean, what\u0027s she doing coming on to you the very first day at work? And coming on so strongly? Leaving herself open to all these problems? She\u0027s too smart for that.\"\n Sanders shrugged.\n \"You think it\u0027s just because you\u0027re irresistible?\" Fernandez said. \"With all due respect, I doubt it.\"\n He found himself thinking of the time he first knew Meredith, when she was doing demos, and the way she used to cross her legs whenever she was asked a question she couldn\u0027t answer. \"She could always use sex to distract people. She\u0027s good at that.\"\n \"I believe it,\" Fernandez said. \"So what is she distracting us from now?\"\n Sanders had no answer. But his instinct was that something else was going on. \"Who knows how people really are in private?\" he said. \"I once knew this woman, she looked like an angel, but she liked bikers to beat her up.\"\n \"Uh-huh,\" Fernandez said. \"That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m not buying it for Johnson. Because Johnson strikes me as very controlled, and her behavior with you was not controlled.\"\n \"You said it yourself, there\u0027s a pattern.\"\n \"Yeah. Maybe. But why the first day? Why right away? I think she had another reason.\"\n Sanders said, \"And what about me? Do you think I had another reason?\"\n \"I assume you did,\" she said, looking at him seriously. \"But we\u0027ll talk about that later.\"\n Alan came up from the parking lot, shaking his head.\n \"What\u0027ve you got?\" Fernandez said.\n \"Nothing good. We\u0027re striking out everywhere,\" he said. He flipped open his notepad. \"Okay. Now, we\u0027ve checked out that Internet address. The message originated in the `U District.\u0027 And `Afriend\u0027 turns out to be Dr. Arthur A. Friend. He\u0027s a professor of inorganic chemistry at the University of Washington. That name mean anything to you?\"\n \"No,\" Sanders said.\n \"I\u0027m not surprised. At the moment, Professor Friend is in northern Nepal on a consulting job for the Nepalese government. He\u0027s been there for three weeks. He\u0027s not expected back until late July. So it probably isn\u0027t him sending the messages anyway.\"\n \"Somebody\u0027s using his Internet address?\"\n \"His assistant says that\u0027s impossible. His office is locked while he\u0027s away, and nobody goes in there except her. So nobody has access to his computer terminal. The assistant says she goes in once a day and answers Dr. Friend\u0027s e-mail, but otherwise the computer is off. And nobody knows the password but her. So I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"It\u0027s a message coming out of a locked office?\" Sanders said, frowning.\n \"I don\u0027t know. We\u0027re still working on it. But for the moment, it\u0027s a mystery.\"\n \"All right, fine,\" Fernandez said. \"What about Conrad Computer?\"\n \"Conrad has taken a very hard position. They will only release information to the hiring company, meaning DigiCom. Nothing to us. And they say that the hiring company has not requested it. When we pushed, Conrad called DigiCom themselves, and DigiCom told them they weren\u0027t interested in any information Conrad might have.\"\n \"Hmmm.\"\n \"Next, the husband,\" Alan said. \"I talked to someone who worked in his company, CoStar. Says the husband hates her, has lots of bad things to say about her. But he\u0027s in Mexico on vacation with his new girlfriend until next week.\"\n \"Too bad.\"\n \"Novell,\" Alan said. \"They keep only the last five years current. Prior to that, records are in cold storage at headquarters in Utah. They have no idea what they\u0027ll show, but they\u0027re willing to get them out if we\u0027ll pay for it. It\u0027ll take two weeks.\"\n Fernandez shook her head. \"Not good.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"I have a strong feeling that Conrad Computer is sitting on something,\" Fernandez said.\n \"Maybe, but we\u0027ll have to sue to get it. And there\u0027s no time.\" Alan looked across the courtyard at the others. \"What\u0027s happening now?\"\n \"Nothing. They\u0027re hanging tough.\"\n \"Still?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-20.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: \n The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ... \n Thomas Sanders\u0027 world collapses in just 24 hours – he is passed over for promotion, his new woman boss comes on to him during a drink after work, then, the next morning, he learns that she has accused him of sexually harassing her.
