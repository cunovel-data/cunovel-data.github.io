{"id":74939,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"No,\" Sanders said, shaking his head slowly. \"No, I was just leaving.\" In the car, driving to the courthouse, Louise Fernandez recounted Sanders\u0027s story to the two junior lawyers traveling with her. One lawyer, a woman, said, \"You don\u0027t really believe him?\" \"Who knows?\" Fernandez said. \"It was behind closed doors. There\u0027s never a way to know.\" The young woman shook her head. \"I just can\u0027t believe a woman would act that way. So aggressively.\" \"Why not?\" Fernandez said. \"Suppose this wasn\u0027t a case of harassment. Suppose this was a question of implied promise between a man and a woman. The man claims that behind closed doors he was promised a big bonus, but the woman denies it. Would you assume that the man was lying because a woman wouldn\u0027t act that way?\" \"Not about that, no.\" \"In that situation, you\u0027d think that anything was possible.\" \"But this isn\u0027t a contract,\" the woman said. \"This is sexual behavior.\" \"So you think women are unpredictable in their contractual arrangements, but stereotypical in their sexual arrangements?\" The woman said, \"I don\u0027t know if stereotypical is the word I\u0027d use.\" \"You just said that you can\u0027t believe a woman would act aggressively in sex. Isn\u0027t that a stereotype?\" \"Well, no,\" the woman said. \"It\u0027s not a stereotype, because it\u0027s true. Women are different from men when it comes to sex.\" \"And black people have rhythm,\" Fernandez said. \"Asians are workaholics. And Hispanics don\u0027t confront . . .\" \"But this is different. I mean, there are studies about this. Men and women don\u0027t even talk to each other the same way.\" \"Oh, you mean like the studies that show that women are less good at business and strategic thinking?\" \"No. Those studies are wrong.\" \"I see. Those studies are wrong. But the studies about sexual differences are right?\" \"Well, sure. Because sex is fundamental. It\u0027s a primal drive.\" \"I don\u0027t see why. It\u0027s used for all sorts of purposes. As a way of relating, a way of placating, a way of provoking, as an offer, as a weapon, as a threat. It can be quite complicated, the ways sex is used. Haven\u0027t you found that to be true?\" The woman crossed her arms. \"I don\u0027t think so.\" Speaking for the first time, the young man said, \"So what\u0027d you tell this guy? Not to litigate?\" \"No. But I told him his problems.\" \"What do you think he should do?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Fernandez said. \"But I know what he should have done.\" \"What?\" \"It\u0027s terrible to say it,\" she said. \"But in the real world? With no witnesses? Alone in the office with his boss? He probably should have shut up and fucked her. Because right now, that poor bastard has no options at all. If he\u0027s not careful, his life is over.\" Sanders walked slowly back down the hill toward Pioneer Square. The rain had stopped, but the afternoon was still damp and gray. The wet pavement beneath his feet sloped steeply downward. Around him the tops of the skyscrapers disappeared into the low-hanging, chilly mist. He was not sure what he had expected to hear from Louise Fernandez, but it was certainly not a detailed account of the possibility of his being fired, mortgaging his house, and never working again. Sanders felt overwhelmed by the sudden turn that his life had taken, and by a realization of the precariousness of his existence. Two days ago, he was an established executive with a stable position and a promising future. Now he faced disgrace, humiliation, loss of his job. All sense of security had vanished. He thought of all the questions Fernandez had asked him-questions that had never occurred to him before. Why hadn\u0027t he told anyone. Why hadn\u0027t he made notes. Why hadn\u0027t he told Meredith explicitly that her advances were unwelcome. Fernandez operated in a world of rules and distinctions that he did not understand, that had never crossed his mind. And now those distinctions turned out to be vitally important. Your situation is not good, Mr. Sanders. And yet . . . how could he have prevented this? What should he have done instead? He considered the possibilities. Suppose he had called Blackburn right after the meeting with Meredith, and had told him in detail that Meredith had harassed him. He could have called from the ferry, lodged his complaint before she lodged hers. Would it have made a difference? What would Blackburn have done? He shook his head, thinking about it. It seemed unlikely that anything would make a difference. Because in the end, Meredith was tied in to the power structure of the company in a way that Sanders was not. Meredith was a corporate player; she had power, allies. That was the message the final message-of this situation. Sanders didn\u0027t count. He was just a technical guy, a cog in the corporate wheels. His job was to get along with his new boss, and he had failed to do that. Whatever he did now was just whining. Or worse: ratting on the boss. Whistleblowing. And nobody liked a whistle-blower. So what could he have done? As he thought about it, he realized that he couldn\u0027t have called Blackburn right after the meeting because his cellular phone had gone dead, its power drained. He had a sudden image of a car-a man and a woman in a car, driving to a party. Somebody had told him something once . . . a story about some people in a car. It teased him. He couldn\u0027t quite get it. There were plenty of reasons why the phone might be dead. The most likely explanation was nicad memory. The new phones used rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, and if they didn\u0027t completely discharge between uses, the batteries could reset themselves at a shorter duration. You never knew when it was going to show up. Sanders had had to throw out batteries before because they developed a short memory. He took out his phone, turned it on. It glowed brightly. The battery was holding up fine today. But there was something . . . Driving in a car. Something he wasn\u0027t thinking about. Going to a party. He frowned. He couldn\u0027t get it. It hung at the back of his memory, too dim to recover. But it started him thinking: what else wasn\u0027t he getting? Because as he considered the whole situation, he began to have the nagging sense that there was something else that he was overlooking. And he had the feeling that Fernandez had overlooked it, too. Something hadn\u0027t come up in her questions to him. Something that everybody was taking for granted, even though- Meredith. Something about Meredith. She had accused him of harassment. She had gone to Blackburn and accused him the next morning. Why would she do that? No doubt she felt guilty about what had happened at the meeting. And perhaps she was afraid Sanders would accuse her, so she decided to accuse him first. Her accusation was understandable in that light. But if Meredith really had power, it didn\u0027t make sense to raise the sexual issue at all. She could just as easily have gone to Blackburn and said, Listen, it isn\u0027t working out with Tom. I can\u0027t deal with him. We have to make a change. And Blackburn would have done it. Instead, she had accused him of harassment. And that must have been embarrassing to her. Because harassment implied a loss of control. It meant that she had not been able to control her subordinate in a meeting. Even if something unpleasant did happen, a boss would never mention it. Harassment is about power. It was one thing if you were a lowly female assistant fondled by a stronger, powerful man. But in this case Meredith was the boss. She had all the power. Why would she claim harassment by Sanders? Because the fact was, subordinates didn\u0027t harass their bosses. It just didn\u0027t happen. You\u0027d have to be crazy to harass your boss. Harassment is about power-the undue exercise of power by a superior over a subordinate. For her to claim sexual harassment was, in an odd way, to admit that she was subordinate to Sanders. And she would never do that. Quite the contrary: Meredith was new to her job, eager to prove that she was in control of the situation. So her accusation made no sense-unless she was using it as a convenient way to destroy him. Sexual harassment had the advantage of being a charge that was difficult to recover from. You were presumed guilty until proven innocent-and it was hard to prove innocence. It tarnished any man, no matter how frivolous the accusation. In that sense, harassment was a very powerful accusation. The most powerful accusation she could make. But then, she said that she wasn\u0027t going to press charges. And the question was Why not? Sanders stopped on the street. That was it. She assured me, she\u0027s not going to press charges. Why wasn\u0027t Meredith going to press charges? At the time that Blackburn said that, Sanders had never questioned it. Louise Fernandez had never questioned it. But the fact was, Meredith\u0027s refusal to press charges made no sense at all. She had already accused him. Why not press it? Why not carry it to its conclusion? Maybe Blackburn had talked her out of it. Blackburn was always so concerned about appearances. But Sanders didn\u0027t think that was what had happened. Because a formal accusation could still be handled quietly. It could be processed inside the company. And from Meredith\u0027s standpoint, there were real advantages to a formal accusation. Sanders was popular at DigiCom. He had been with the company a long time. If her goal was to get rid of him, to banish him to Texas, why not defuse the inevitable corporate grumbling by letting the accusation work its way through the company grapevine? Why not make it official? The more Sanders thought about it, the more it seemed that there was only one explanation: Meredith wasn\u0027t going to press charges because she couldn\u0027t. She couldn\u0027t, because she had some other problem. Some other consideration. Something else was going on. We can handle it quietly. Slowly, Sanders began to see everything differently. In the meeting earlier that day, Blackburn hadn\u0027t been ignoring him or slighting him. Not at all: Blackburn was scrambling. Blackburn was scared. We can handle it quietly. It\u0027s best for everyone. What did he mean, best for everyone? What problem did Meredith have? What problem could she have? The more Sanders thought about it, the more it seemed that there could be only one possible reason why she wasn\u0027t pressing charges against him. He took out his phone, called United Airlines, and booked three round-trip tickets to Phoenix. And then he called his wife. Ygoddamn son of a bitch,\" Susan said. They were sitting in a corner table at 11 Terrazzo. It was two o\u0027clock; the restaurant was nearly deserted. Susan had listened to him for half an hour, without interruption or comment. He told her everything that had happened in his meeting with Meredith, and everything that had happened that morning. The Conley-White meeting. The conversation with Phil. The conversation with Fernandez. Now he had finished. She stared at him. \"I could really learn to despise you, you know that? You son of a bitch, why didn\u0027t you tell me she was your ex-girlfriend?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t want to go into it.\" \"You didn\u0027t want to go into it? Adele and Mary Anne are talking to me on the phone all day, and they know, but I don\u0027t? It\u0027s humiliating, Tom.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"you know you\u0027ve been upset a lot lately, and-\" \"Cut the crap, Tom,\" she said. \"This has nothing to do with me. You didn\u0027t tell me because you didn\u0027t want to.\" \"Susan, that\u0027s not-\" \"Yes it is, Tom. I was asking you about her, last night. You could have told me if you wanted to. But you didn\u0027t.\" She shook her head. \"Son of a bitch. I can\u0027t believe what an asshole you are. You\u0027ve made a real mess of this. Do you realize what a mess this is?\" \"Yes,\" he said, hanging his head. \"Don\u0027t act contrite with me, you asshole.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"You\u0027re sorry? Fuck you, you\u0027re sorry. Jesus Christ. I can\u0027t believe you. What an asshole. You spent the night with your goddamned girlfriend.\" \"I didn\u0027t spend the night. And she\u0027s not my girlfriend.\" \"What do you mean? She was your big heartthrob.\" \"She wasn\u0027t my `big heartthrob.\u0027 \" \"Oh yeah? Then why wouldn\u0027t you tell me?\" She shook her head. `Just answer one question. Did you fuck her or not?\" \"No. I didn\u0027t.\" She stared at him intently, stirring her coffee. \"You\u0027re telling me the truth?\" \"Yes.\" \"Nothing left out? No inconvenient parts skipped?\" \"No. Nothing.\" \"Then why would she accuse you?\" \"What do you mean?\" he said. \"I mean, there must be a reason she accused you. You must have done something.\" \"Well, I didn\u0027t. I turned her down.\" \"Uh-huh. Sure.\" She frowned at him. \"You know, this is not just about you, Tom. This involves your whole family: me and the kids.\" \"I understand that.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me? If you told me last night, I could have helped you.\" \"Then help me now.\" \"Well, there isn\u0027t much we can do now,\" Susan said, with heavy sarcasm. \"Not after she\u0027s gone to Blackburn and made an accusation first. Now you\u0027re finished.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure.\" \"Trust me, you haven\u0027t got a move,\" she said. \"If you go to trial, it\u0027ll be living hell for at least three years, and I personally don\u0027t think you can win. You\u0027re a man bringing a charge of harassment against a woman. They\u0027ll laugh you out of court.\" \"Maybe.\" \"Trust me, they will. So you can\u0027t go to trial. What can you do? Move to Austin. Jesus.\" \"I keep thinking,\" Sanders said. \"She accused me of harassment, but now she isn\u0027t pressing charges. And I keep thinking, Why isn\u0027t she pressing charges?\" \"Who cares?\" Susan said, with an irritable wave of the hand. \"It could be any of a million reasons. Corporate politics. Or Phil talked her out of it. Or Garvin. It doesn\u0027t matter why. Tom, face the facts: you have no move. Not now, you stupid son of a bitch.\" \"Susan, will you settle down?\" \"Fuck you, Tom. You\u0027re dishonest and irresponsible.\" \"Susan-\" \"We\u0027ve been married five years. I deserve better than this.\" \"Will you take it easy? I\u0027m trying to tell you: I think I do have a move.\" \"Tom. You don\u0027t.\" \"I think I do. Because this is a very dangerous situation,\" Sanders said. \"It\u0027s dangerous for everybody.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"Let\u0027s assume that Louise Fernandez told me the truth about my lawsuit.\" \"She did. She\u0027s a good lawyer.\" \"But she wasn\u0027t looking at it from the company\u0027s standpoint. She was looking at it from the plaintiffs standpoint.\" \"Yeah, well, you\u0027re a plaintiff.\" \"No, I\u0027m not,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a potential plaintiff.\" There was a moment of silence. Susan stared at him. Her eyes scanned his face. She frowned. He watched her put it together. \"You\u0027re kidding.\" \"No.\" \"You must be out of your mind.\" \"No. Look at the situation. DigiCom\u0027s in the middle of a merger with a very conservative East Coast company. A company that\u0027s already pulled out of one merger because an employee had a little bad publicity. Supposedly this employee used some rough language while firing a temp secretary, and then Conley-White pulled out. They\u0027re very skittish about publicity. Which means the last thing anybody at DigiCom wants is a sexual harassment suit against the new female vice president.\" \"Tom. Do you realize what you\u0027re saying?\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"If you do this, they\u0027re going to go crazy. They\u0027re going to try to destroy you.\" \"I know.\" \"Have you talked to Max about this? Maybe you should.\" \"The hell with Max. He\u0027s a crazy old man.\" \"I\u0027d ask him. Because this isn\u0027t really your thing, Tom. You were never a corporate infighter. I don\u0027t know if you can pull this off.\" \"I think I can.\" \"It\u0027ll be nasty. In a day or so, you\u0027re going to wish you had taken the Austin job.\" \"Fuck it.\" \"It\u0027ll get really mean, Tom. You\u0027ll lose your friends.\" \"Fuck it.\" `Just so you\u0027re ready.\" \"I am.\" Sanders looked at his watch. \"Susan, I want you to take the kids and visit your mother for a few days.\" Her mother lived in Phoenix. \"If you go home now and pack, you can make the eight o\u0027clock flight at Sea-Tac. I\u0027ve booked three seats for you.\" She stared at him, as if she were seeing a stranger. \"You\u0027re really going to do this . . . ,\" she said slowly. \"Yes. I am.\" \"Oh boy.\" She bent over, picked up her purse from the floor, and pulled out her day organizer. He said, \"I don\u0027t want you or the kids to be involved. I don\u0027t want anybody pushing a news camera in their faces, Susan.\" \"Well, just a minute . . .\" She ran her finger down her appointments. \"I can move that . . . And . . . conference call . . . Yes.\" She looked up. \"Yes. I can leave for a few days.\" She glanced at her watch. \"I guess I better hurry and pack.\" He stood up and walked outside the restaurant with her. It was raining; the light on the street was gray and bleak. She looked up at him and kissed him on the cheek. \"Good luck, Tom. Be careful.\" He could see that she was frightened. It made him frightened, too. \"I\u0027ll be okay.\" \"I love you,\" she said. And then she walked quickly away in the rain. He waited for a moment to see if she looked back at him, but she never did. Walking back to his office, he suddenly realized how alone he felt. Susan was leaving with the kids. He was on his own now. He had imagined he would feel relieved, free to act without restraint, but instead he felt abandoned and at risk. Chilled, he thrust his hands into the pockets of his raincoat. He hadn\u0027t handled the lunch with Susan well. And she would be going off, mulling over his answers. Why didn\u0027t you tell me? He hadn\u0027t answered that well. He hadn\u0027t been able to express the conflicting feelings he had experienced last night. The unclean feeling, and the guilt, and the sense that he had somehow done something wrong, even though he hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. You could have told me. He hadn\u0027t done anything wrong, he told himself. But then why hadn\u0027t he told her? He had no answer to that. He passed a graphics shop, and a plumbing supply store with white porcelain fixtures in a window display. You didn\u0027t tell me because you didn\u0027t want to. But that made no sense. Why wouldn\u0027t he want to tell her? Once again, his thoughts were interrupted by images from the past: the white garter belt... a bowl of popcorn .... the stained-glass flower on the door to his apartment. Cut the crap, Tom. This has nothing to do with me. Blood in the white bathroom sink, and Meredith laughing about it. Why was she laughing? He couldn\u0027t remember now; it was just an isolated image. A stewardess putting a tray of airline food in front of him. A suitcase on the bed. The television sound turned off. The stained-glass flower, in gaudy orange and purple. Have you talked to Max? She was right about that, he thought. He should talk to Max. And he would, right after he gave Blackburn the bad news. Sanders was back at his office at two-thirty. He was surprised to find Blackburn there, standing behind Sanders\u0027s desk, talking on his phone. Blackburn hung up, looking a little guilty. \"Oh, Tom. Good. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re back.\" He walked back around Sanders\u0027s desk. \"What have you decided?\" \"I\u0027ve thought this over very carefully,\" Sanders said, closing the door to the hallway. \"And?\" \"I\u0027ve decided to retain Louise Fernandez of Marin, Howard to represent me.\" Blackburn looked puzzled. \"To represent you?\" \"Yes. In the event it becomes necessary to litigate.\" \"Litigate,\" Blackburn said. \"On what basis would you litigate, Tom?\" \"Sexual harassment under Title VII,\" Sanders said. \"Oh, Tom,\" Blackburn said, making a mournful face. \"That would be unwise. That would be very unwise. I urge you to reconsider.\" \"I\u0027ve reconsidered all day,\" Sanders said. \"But the fact is, Meredith Johnson harassed me, she made advances to me and I turned her down. Now she\u0027s a woman scorned, and she is being vindictive toward me. I\u0027m prepared to sue if it comes to that.\" \"Tom...\" \"That\u0027s it, Phil. That\u0027s what\u0027ll happen if you transfer me out of the division.\" Blackburn threw up his hands. \"But what do you expect us to do? Transfer Meredith?\" \"Yes,\" Sanders said. \"Or fire her. That\u0027s the usual thing one does with a harassing supervisor.\" \"But you forget: she\u0027s accused you of harassment, too.\" \"She\u0027s lying,\" Sanders said. \"But there are no witnesses, Tom. No evidence either way. You and she are both our trusted employees. How do you expect us to decide who to believe?\" \"That\u0027s your problem, Phil. All I have to say is, I\u0027m innocent. And I\u0027m prepared to sue.\" Blackburn stood in the middle of the room, frowning. \"Louise Fernandez is a smart attorney. I can\u0027t believe she recommended this course of action to you.\" \"No. This is my decision.\" \"Then it\u0027s very unwise,\" Blackburn said. \"You are putting the company in a very difficult position.\" \"The company is putting me in a difficult position.\" \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Phil said. \"I hope this doesn\u0027t force us to terminate you.\" Sanders stared at him, meeting his gaze evenly. \"I hope not, too,\" he said. \"But I don\u0027t have confidence that the company has taken my complaint seriously. I\u0027ll fill out a formal charge of sexual harassment with Bill Everts in HR later today. And I\u0027m asking Louise to draw up the necessary papers to file with the state Human Rights Commission.\" \"Christ.\" \"She should file first thing tomorrow morning.\" \"I don\u0027t see what the rush is.\" \"There\u0027s no rush. It\u0027s just a filing. To get the complaint on record. I\u0027m required to do that.\" \"But this is very serious, Tom.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-12.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ...
