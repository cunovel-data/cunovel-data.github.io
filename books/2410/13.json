At least, with the HRC. Give us a chance to conduct an in-house investigation before you take this outside.\"\\n\\n \"But you aren\u0027t conducting an in-house investigation, Phil.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we are.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t even want to hear my side of the story this morning. You told me it didn\u0027t matter.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true,\" Blackburn said. \"You misunderstood me entirely. Of course it matters. And I assure you, we will hear your story in detail as part of our investigation.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Phil,\" Sanders said. \"I don\u0027t see how the company can be neutral on this issue. It seems everything is stacked against me. Everybody believes Meredith and not me.\"\\n\\n \"I assure you that is not the case.\"\\n\\n \"It certainly seems like it. You told me this morning how well connected she is. How many allies she has. You mentioned that several times.\"\\n\\n \"Our investigation will be scrupulous and impartial. But in any case it seems reasonable to ask you to wait for the outcome before filing with a state agency.\"\\n\\n \"How long do you want me to wait?\"\\n\\n \"Thirty days.\"\\n\\n Sanders laughed.\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s the standard time for a harassment investigation.\"\\n\\n \"You could do it in a day, if you wanted to.\"\\n\\n \"But you must agree, Tom, that we\u0027re very busy right now, with all the merger meetings.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s your problem, Phil. I have a different problem. I\u0027ve been unjustly treated by my superior, and I feel I have a right, as a longstanding senior employee, to see my complaint resolved promptly.\"\\n\\n Blackburn sighed. \"All right. Let me get back to you,\" he said. He hurried out of the room.\\n\\n Sanders slumped in his chair and stared into space.\\n\\n It had begun.\\n\\n Fifteen minutes later, Blackburn met with Garvin in the fifth-floor executive conference room. Also present at the meeting were Stephanie Kaplan and Bill Everts, the head of Human Resources at DigiCom.\\n\\n Blackburn began the meeting by saying, \"Tom Sanders has retained outside counsel and is threatening litigation over Meredith Johnson.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Christ,\" Garvin said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s claiming sexual harassment.\"\\n\\n Garvin kicked the leg of the table. \"That son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n Kaplan said, \"What does he say happened?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have all the details yet,\" Blackburn said. \"But in essence he claims that Meredith made sexual overtures to him in her office last night, that he turned her down, and that now she is being vindictive.\"\\n\\n Garvin gave a long sigh. \"Shit,\" he said. \"This is just what I didn\u0027t want to happen. This could be a disaster.\"\\n\\n \"I know, Bob.\"\\n\\n Stephanie Kaplan said, \"Did she do it?\"\\n\\n \"Christ,\" Garvin said. \"Who knows in these situations. That\u0027s always the question.\" He turned to Everts. \"Has Sanders come to you about this?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet, no. I imagine he will.\"\\n\\n \"We have to keep it in-house,\" Garvin said. \"That\u0027s essential.\"\\n\\n \"Essential,\" Kaplan said, nodding. \"Phil has to make sure it stays in-house.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying,\" Blackburn said. \"But Sanders is talking about filing tomorrow with the HRC.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a public filing?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"How soon is it made public?\"\\n\\n \"Probably within forty-eight hours. Depending on how fast HRC does the paperwork.\"\\n\\n \"Christ,\" Garvin said. \"Forty-eight hours? What\u0027s the matter with him? Doesn\u0027t he realize what he\u0027s doing?\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"I think he does. I think he knows exactly.\"\\n\\n \"Blackmail?\"\\n\\n \"Well. Pressure.\"\\n\\n Garvin said, \"Have you talked to Meredith?\"\\n\\n \"Not since this morning.\"\\n\\n \"Somebody\u0027s got to talk to her. I\u0027ll talk to her. But how are we going to stop Sanders?\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"I asked him to hold off the HRC filing, pending our investigation, for thirty days. He said no. He said we should be able to conduct our investigation in one day.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he got that right,\" Garvin said. \"For all kinds of reasons, we damn well better conduct the investigation in one day.\"\\n\\n \"Bob, I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible,\" Blackburn said. \"We have significant exposure here. The corporation is required by law to conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. We can\u0027t appear to be rushed or-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" Garvin said. \"I don\u0027t want to hear this legal pissing and moaning. What are we talking about? Two people, right? And no witnesses, right? So there\u0027s just two people. How long does it take to interview two people?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it may not be that simple,\" Blackburn said, with a significant look.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s simple,\" Garvin said. \"This is what\u0027s simple. Conley-White is a company obsessed with its public image. They sell textbooks to school boards that believe in Noah\u0027s ark. They sell magazines for kids. They have a vitamin company. They have a health-food company that markets baby foods. Rainbow Mush or something. Now Conley-White\u0027s buying our company, and in the middle of the acquisition a high-profile female executive, the woman in line to become CEO within two years, is accused of seeking sexual favors from a married man. You know what they\u0027re going to do if that gets out? They\u0027re going to bail. You know that Nichols is looking for any excuse to weasel out of this thing. This is perfect for him. Christ.\"\\n\\n \"But Sanders has already questioned our impartiality,\" Blackburn said. \"And I\u0027m not sure how many people know about the, ah, prior questions that we-\"\\n\\n \"Quite a few,\" Kaplan said. \"And didn\u0027t it come up at an officers\u0027 meeting last year?\"\\n\\n \"Check the minutes,\" Garvin said. \"We have no legal problem with current corporate officers, is that right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Blackburn said. \"Current corporate officers cannot be questioned or deposed on these matters.\"\\n\\n \"And we haven\u0027t lost any corporate officers in the last year? Nobody retired or moved?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. So fuck him.\" Garvin turned to Everts. \"Bill, I want you to go back through the HR records, and look carefully at Sanders. See if he\u0027s dotted every i and crossed every t. If he hasn\u0027t, I want to know.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Everts said. \"But my guess is he\u0027s clean.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Garvin said, \"let\u0027s assume that he is. What\u0027s it going to take to make Sanders go away? What does he want?\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"I think he wants his job, Bob.\"\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t have his job.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s the problem,\" Blackburn said.\\n\\n Garvin snorted. \"What\u0027s our liability, assuming he ever got to trial?\" \"I don\u0027t think he has a case, based on what happened in that office. Our biggest liability would come from any perceived failure to respect due process and conduct a thorough investigation. Sanders could win on that alone, if we\u0027re not careful. That\u0027s my point.\"\\n\\n \"So we\u0027ll be careful. Fine.\"\\n\\n \"Now, guys,\" Blackburn said. \"I feel strongly obliged to insert a note of caution. The extreme delicacy of this situation means that we have to be mindful of the details. As Pascal once said, `God is in the details.\u0027 And in this case, the competing balance of legitimate legal claims forces me to admit it\u0027s unclear precisely what our best-\"\\n\\n \"Phil,\" Garvin said. \"Cut the crap.\"\\n\\n Kaplan said, \"Mies.\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Mies van der Rohe said, `God is in the details.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Who gives a shit?\" Garvin said, pounding the table. \"The point is, Sanders has no case he just has us by the balls. And he knows it.\"\\n\\n Blackburn winced. \"I wouldn\u0027t phrase it exactly that way, but-\" \"But that\u0027s the fucking situation.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Kaplan said, \"Tom\u0027s smart, you know. A little naive, but smart.\"\\n\\n \"Very smart,\" Garvin said. \"Remember, I trained him. Taught him all he knows. He\u0027s going to be a big problem.\" He turned to Blackburn. \"Get to the bottom line. What\u0027re we dealing with? Impartiality, right?\"\\n\\n \"Yes . . .\"\\n\\n \"And we want to move him out.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Will he accept mediation?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I doubt it.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Ordinarily, we only use mediation to resolve settlement packages for employees who are leaving.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"I think that\u0027s how he\u0027ll view it.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s try, anyway. Tell him it\u0027s nonbinding, and see if we can get him to accept it on that basis. Give him three names and let him pick one. Mediate it tomorrow. Do I need to talk to him?\"\\n\\n \"Probably. Let me try first, and you back up.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Kaplan said, \"Of course, if we go to an outside mediator, we introduce an unpredictable element.\"\\n\\n \"You mean the mediator could find against us? I\u0027ll take the risk,\" Garvin said. \"The important thing is to get the thing resolved. Quietly-and fast. I don\u0027t want Ed Nichols backpedaling on me. We have a press conference scheduled for Friday noon. I want this issue dead and buried by then, and I want Meredith Johnson announced as the new head of the division on Friday. Everybody clear on what\u0027s going to happen?\"\\n\\n They said they were.\\n\\n \"Then do it,\" Garvin said, and walked out of the room. Blackburn hurried after him.\\n\\n In the hallway outside, Garvin said to Blackburn, \"Christ, what a mess. Let me tell you. I\u0027m very unhappy.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Blackburn said mournfully. He was shaking his head sadly.\\n\\n \"You really screwed the pooch on this one, Phil. Christ. You could have handled this one better. A lot better.\"\\n\\n \"How? What could I have done? He says that she hustled him, Bob. It\u0027s a serious matter.\"\\n\\n \"Meredith Johnson is vital to the success of this merger,\" Garvin said flatly.\\n\\n \"Yes, Bob. Of course.\"\\n\\n \"We must keep her.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Bob. But we both know that in the past she has-\"\\n\\n \"She has proven herself an outstanding piece of executive talent,\" Garvin said, interrupting him. \"I won\u0027t allow these ridiculous allegations to jeopardize her career.\"\\n\\n Blackburn was aware of Garvin\u0027s unswerving support of Meredith. For years, Garvin had had a blind spot for Johnson. Whenever criticisms ofJohnson arose, Garvin would somehow change the subject, shift to something else. There was no reasoning with him. But now Blackburn felt he had to try. \"Bob,\" he said. \"Meredith\u0027s only human. We know she has her limitations.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Garvin said. \"She has youth. Enthusiasm. Honesty. Unwillingness to play corporate games. And of course, she\u0027s a woman. That\u0027s a real limitation, being a woman.\"\\n\\n \"But Bob--\"\\n\\n \"I tell you, I can\u0027t stomach the excuses anymore,\" Garvin said. \"We don\u0027t have women in high corporate positions here. Nobody does. Corporate America is rooms full of men. And whenever I talk about putting a woman in, there\u0027s always a `But Bob\u0027 that comes up. The hell with it, Phil. We\u0027ve got to break the glass ceiling sometime.\"\\n\\n Blackburn sighed. Garvin was shifting the subject again. He said, \"Bob, nobody\u0027s disagreeing with-\"\\n\\n \"Yes, they are. You\u0027re disagreeing, Phil. You\u0027re giving me excuses why Meredith isn\u0027t suitable. And I\u0027m telling you that if I had named some other woman, there\u0027d be other excuses why that other woman isn\u0027t suitable. And I tell you, I\u0027m tired of it.\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"We\u0027ve got Stephanie. We\u0027ve got Mary Anne.\"\\n\\n \"Tokens,\" Garvin said, with a dismissing wave. \"Sure, let the CFO be a woman. Let a couple of the midrange execs be women. Throw the broads a bone. The fact remains. You can\u0027t tell me that a bright, able young woman starting out in business isn\u0027t held back by a hundred little reasons, oh such good reasons, why she shouldn\u0027t be advanced, why she shouldn\u0027t attain a major position of power. But in the end, it\u0027s just prejudice. And it has to stop. We have to give these bright young women a decent opportunity.\"\\n\\n Blackburn said, \"Well, Bob. I just think it would be prudent for you to get Meredith\u0027s view of this situation.\"\\n\\n \"I will. I\u0027ll find out what the hell happened. I know she\u0027ll tell me. But this thing still has to be resolved.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it does, Bob.\"\\n\\n \"And I want you to be clear. I expect you to do whatever is necessary to get it resolved.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Bob.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever is necessary,\" Garvin said. \"Put the pressure on Sanders. Make sure he feels it. Rattle his cage, Phil.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Bob.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll deal with Meredith. You just take care of Sanders. I want you to rattle his fucking cage until he\u0027s black and blue.\"\\n\\n Bob.\" Meredith Johnson stood at one of the center tables in the Design Group laboratory, going over the torn-apart Twinkle drives with Mark Lewyn. She came over when she saw Garvin standing to one side. \"I can\u0027t tell you how sorry I am about all this business with Sanders.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re having some problems with it,\" Garvin said.\\n\\n \"I keep going over what happened,\" she said. \"Wondering what I should have done. But he was angry and out of control. He had too much to drink, and he behaved badly. Not that we all haven\u0027t done that at some time in our lives, but. . .\" She shrugged. \"Anyway, I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Apparently, he\u0027s going to file a harassment charge.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s unfortunate,\" she said. \"But I suppose it\u0027s part of the pattern-trying to humiliate me, to discredit me with the people in the division.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t let that happen,\" Garvin said.\\n\\n \"He resented my getting the job, and he couldn\u0027t deal with having me as his superior. He had to try and put me in my place. Some men are like that.\" She shook her head sadly. \"For all the talk about the new male sensibility, I\u0027m afraid very few men are like you, Bob.\"\\n\\n Garvin said, \"My concern now, Meredith, is that his filing may interfere with the acquisition.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see why that would be a problem,\" she said. \"I think we can keep it under control.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a problem, if he files with the state HRC.\"\\n\\n \"You mean he\u0027s going to go outside?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s exactly what I mean.\"\\n\\n Meredith stared off into space. For the first time, she seemed to lose her composure. She bit her lip. \"That could be very awkward.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say. I\u0027ve sent Phil to see him, to ask if we can mediate. With an experienced outside person. Someone like Judge Murphy. I\u0027m trying to arrange it for tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Fine,\" Meredith said. \"I can clear my schedule for a couple of hours tomorrow. But I don\u0027t know what we can expect to come out of it. He won\u0027t admit what happened, I\u0027m sure. And there isn\u0027t any record, or any witnesses.\"\\n\\n \"I wanted you to fill me in,\" Garvin said, \"on exactly what did happen, last night.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Bob,\" she sighed. \"I blame myself, every time I go over it.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but I do. If my assistant hadn\u0027t gone off to rent her apartment, I could have buzzed her in, and none of this would have happened.\"\\n\\n \"I think you better tell me, Meredith.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, Bob.\" She leaned toward him and spoke quietly, steadily, for the next several minutes. Garvin stood beside her, shaking his head angrily as he listened.\\n\\n Don Cherry put his Nikes up on Lewyn\u0027s desk. \"Yeah? So Garvin came in. Then what happened?\"\\n\\n \"So Garvin\u0027s standing over there in the corner, hopping up and down from one foot to the other, the way he does. Waiting to be noticed. He won\u0027t come over, he\u0027s waiting to be noticed. And Meredith\u0027s talking to me about the Twinkle drive that I have spread all over the table, and I\u0027m showing her what we\u0027ve found is wrong with the laser heads\"\\n\\n \"She gets all that?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, she seems okay. She\u0027s not Sanders, but she\u0027s okay. Fast learner.\"\\n\\n \"And better perfume than Sanders,\" Cherry said.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I like her perfume,\" Lewyn said. \"Anyway-\"\\n\\n \"Sanders\u0027s perfume leaves a lot to be desired.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Anyway, pretty soon Garvin gets tired of hopping, and he gives a discreet little cough, and Meredith notices Garvin and she goes `Oh,\u0027 with a little thrill in her voice, you know that little sharp intake of breath?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-oh,\" Cherry said. \"Are we talking humparoonie here or what?\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s the thing,\" Lewyn said. \"She goes running over to him, and he holds out his arms to her, and I tell you it looks like that ad where the two lovers run toward each other in slow motion.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-oh,\" Cherry said. \"Garvin\u0027s wife is going to be pissed.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s the thing,\" Lewyn said. \"When they finally get together, standing there side by side, it isn\u0027t that way at all. They\u0027re talking, and she\u0027s sort of cooing and batting her eyes at him, and he\u0027s such a tough guy he doesn\u0027t acknowledge it, but it\u0027s working on him.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s seriously cute, that\u0027s why,\" Cherry said. \"I mean face it, she\u0027s got an outstanding molded case, with superior fit and finish.\"\\n\\n \"But the thing is, it\u0027s not like lovers at all. I\u0027m staring, trying not to stare, and I tell you, it\u0027s not lovers. It\u0027s something else. It\u0027s almost like father-daughter, Don.\"\\n\\n \"Hey. You can fuck your daughter. Millions do.\"\\n\\n \"No, you know what I think? I think Bob sees himself in her. He sees something that reminds him of himself when he was younger. Some kind of energy or something. And I tell you, she plays it, Don. He crosses his arms, she crosses hers. He leans against the wall, she leans against the wall. She matches him exactly. And from a distance, I\u0027m telling you: she looks like him, Don.\"\\n\\n \"No . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Think about it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027d have to be from a very long distance,\" Cherry said. He took his feet off the table, and got up to leave. \"So what\u0027re we saying here? Nepotism in disguise?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But Meredith\u0027s got some kind of rapport with him. It isn\u0027t pure business.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" Cherry said. \"Nothing\u0027s pure business. I learned that one a long time ago.\"\\n\\n Louise Fernandez came into her office, and dropped her briefcase on the floor. She thumbed through a stack of phone messages and turned to Sanders. \"What\u0027s going on? I have three calls this afternoon from Phil Blackburn.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because I told him I had retained you as my attorney, that I was prepared to litigate my claim. And I, uh, suggested that you were filing with the HRC in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t possibly file tomorrow,\" she said. \"And I wouldn\u0027t recommend that we do so now, in any event. Mr. Sanders, I take false statements very seriously. Don\u0027t ever characterize my actions again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said. \"But things are happening very fast.\"\\n\\n `Just so we are clear. I don\u0027t like it, and if it happens again, you\u0027ll be looking for new counsel.\" That coldness again, the sudden coldness. \"Now. So you told Blackburn. What was his response?\"\\n\\n \"He asked me if I would mediate.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely not,\" Fernandez said.\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Mediation is invariably to the benefit of the company.\"\\n\\n \"He said it would be non-binding.\"\\n\\n \"Even so. It amounts to free discovery on their part. There\u0027s no reason to give it to them.\"\\n\\n \"And he said you could be present,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Of course I can be present, Mr. Sanders. That\u0027s no concession. You must have an attorney present at all times or the mediation will be invalid.\"\\n\\n \"Here are the three names he gave me, as possible mediators.\" Sanders passed her the list.\\n\\n She glanced at it briefly. \"The usual suspects. One of them is better than the other two. But I still don\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"He wants to do the mediation tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Tomorrow?\" Fernandez stared at him, and sat back in her chair.\\n\\n \"Mr. Sanders, I\u0027m all for a timely resolution, but this is ridiculous. We can\u0027t be ready by tomorrow. And as I said, I don\u0027t recommend that you agree to mediate under any circumstances. Is there something here I don\u0027t know?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s have it.\"\\n\\n He hesitated.\\n\\n She said, \"Any communication you make to me is privileged and confidential.\"\\n\\n \"All right. DigiCom is about to be acquired by a New York company called Conley-White.\"\\n\\n \"So the rumors are true.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"They intend to announce the merger at a press conference on Friday. And they intend to announce Meredith Johnson as the new vice president of the company, on Friday.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" she said. \"So that\u0027s Phil\u0027s urgency.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And your complaint presents an immediate and serious problem for him.\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"Let\u0027s say it comes at a very sensitive time.\"\\n\\n She was silent for a moment, peering at him over her reading glasses. \"Mr. Sanders, I misjudged you. I had the impression you were a timid man.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re forcing me to do this.\"\\n\\n \"Are they.\" She gave him an appraising look. Then she pushed the intercom button. \"Bob, let me see my calendar. I have to clear some things. And ask Herb and Alan to come in. Tell them to drop whatever they\u0027re doing. This is more important.\" She pushed the papers aside. \"Are all the mediators on this list available?\"\\n\\n \"I assume so.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to request Barbara Murphy. Judge Murphy. You won\u0027t like her, but she\u0027ll do a better job than the others. I\u0027ll try and set it up for the afternoon if I can. We need the time. Otherwise, late morning. You realize the risk you\u0027re taking? I assume you do. This is a very dangerous game you\u0027ve decided to play.\" She pushed the intercom. \"Bob? Cancel Roger Rosenberg. Cancel Ellen at six. Remind me to call my husband and tell him I won\u0027t be home for dinner.\" She looked at Sanders. \"Neither will you. Do you need to call home?\"\\n\\n \"My wife and kids are leaving town tonight.\" She raised her eyebrows. \"You told her everything?\" \"Yes.\" \"You are serious.\" \"Yes,\" he said. \"I\u0027m serious.\" \"Good,\" she said. \"You\u0027re going to need to be. Let\u0027s be frank, Mr. Sanders. What you have embarked upon is not strictly a legal procedure. In essence, you\u0027re playing the pressure points.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Between now and Friday, you\u0027re in a position to exert considerable pressure on your company. \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And they on you, Mr. Sanders. They on you.\"\\n\\n He found himself in a conference room, facing five people, all taking notes. Seated on either side of Fernandez were two young lawyers, a woman named Eileen and a man named Richard. Then there were two investigators, Alan and Herb: one tall and handsome; the other chubby, with a pockmarked face and a camera hanging around his neck.\\n\\n Fernandez made Sanders go over his story again, in greater detail. She paused frequently to ask questions, noting down times, names, and specific details. The two lawyers never said anything, although Sanders had the strong impression that the young woman was unsympathetic to him. The two investigators were also silent, except at specific points. After Sanders mentioned Meredith\u0027s assistant, Alan, the handsome one, said, \"Her name again?\"\\n\\n \"Betsy Ross.
