I am old, Thomas. Hope has a different meaning, at my age. You wouldn\u0027t understand. These days, I cannot even get around by myself. I must have someone push me. Preferably a pretty woman, but as a rule they do not like to do such things. So here I am, with no pretty woman to push me. Unlike you.\" Sanders sighed. \"Max, do you suppose we can just have an ordinary conversation?\" \"What a good idea,\" Dorfman said. \"I would like that very much. What is an ordinary conversation?\" \"I mean, can we just talk like normal people?\" \"If it will not bore you, Thomas, yes. But I am worried. You know how old people are worried about being boring.\" \"Max. What did you mean about the stained glass?\" He shrugged. \"I meant Meredith, of course. What else?\" \"What about Meredith?\" \"How am I to know?\" Dorfman said irritably. \"All I know of this is what you told me. And all you told me is that you used to take trips, to Korea or Japan, and when you came back, Meredith would-\" \"Tom, I\u0027m sorry to interrupt,\" Cindy said, leaning in the door to the conference room. \"Oh, don\u0027t be sorry,\" Max said. \"Who is this beautiful creature, Thomas?\" \"I\u0027m Cindy Wolfe, Professor Dorfman,\" she said. \"I work for Tom.\" \"Oh, what a lucky man he is!\" Cindy turned to Sanders. \"I\u0027m really sorry, Tom, but one of the executives from Conley-White is in your office, and I thought you would want to\" \"Yes, yes,\" Dorfman said immediately. \"He must go. Conley-White, it sounds very important.\" \"In a minute,\" Sanders said. He turned to Cindy. \"Max and I were in the middle of something.\" \"No, no, Thomas,\" Dorfman said. \"We were just talking about old times. You better go.\" \"Max-\" \"You want to talk more, you think it\u0027s important, you come visit me. I am at the Four Seasons. You know that hotel. It has a wonderful lobby, such high ceilings. Very grand, especially for an old man. So, you go right along, Thomas.\" His eyes narrowed. \"And leave the beautiful Cindy with me.\" Sanders hesitated. \"Watch out for him,\" he said. \"He\u0027s a dirty old man.\" \"As dirty as possible,\" Dorfman cackled. Sanders headed down the hallway to his office. As he left, he heard Dorfman say, \"Now beautiful Cindy, please take me to the lobby where I have a car waiting. And on the way, if you don\u0027t mind indulging an old man, I have a few little questions. So many interesting things are happening in this company. And the secretaries always know everything, don\u0027t they?\" Mr. Sanders.\"Jim Daly stood quickly, as Sanders came into the room. \"I\u0027m glad they found you.\" They shook hands. Sanders gestured for Daly to sit down, and slid behind his own desk. Sanders was not surprised; he had been expecting a visit from Daly or one of the other investment bankers for several days. Members of the Goldman, Sachs team had been speaking individually with people in various departments, going over aspects of the merger. Most of the time they wanted background information; although high technology was central to the acquisition, none of the bankers understood it very well. Sanders expected Daly to ask about progress on the Twinkle drive, and perhaps the Corridor. \"I appreciate your taking the time,\" Daly said, rubbing his bald head. He was a very tall, thin man, and he seemed even taller sitting down, all knees and elbows. \"I wanted to ask you some things, ah, off the record.\" \"Sure,\" Sanders said. \"It\u0027s to do with Meredith Johnson,\" Daly said, in an apologetic voice. \"If you, ah, don\u0027t mind, I\u0027d prefer we just keep this conversation between us.\" \"All right,\" Sanders said. \"I understand that you have been closely involved with setting up the plants in Ireland and Malaysia. And that there has been a little controversy inside the company about how that was carried out.\" \"Well.\" Sanders shrugged. \"Phil Blackburn and I haven\u0027t always seen eye to eye.\" \"Showing your good sense, in my view,\" Daly said dryly. \"But I gather that in these disputes you represent technical expertise, and others in the company represent, ah, various other concerns. Would that be fair?\" \"Yes, I\u0027d say so.\" What was he getting at? \"Well, it\u0027s along those lines that I\u0027d like to hear your thoughts. Bob Garvin has just appointed Ms. Johnson to a position of considerable authority, a step which many in Conley-White applaud. And certainly it would be unfair to prejudge how she will carry out her new duties within the company. But by the same token, it would be derelict of me not to inquire about her past duties. Do you get my drift?\" \"Not exactly,\" Sanders said. \"I\u0027m wondering,\" Daly said, \"what you feel about Ms. Johnson\u0027s past performance with regard to the technical operations of the company. Specifically, her involvement in the foreign operations of DigiCom.\" Sanders frowned, thinking back. \"I\u0027m not aware that she\u0027s had much involvement,\" he said. \"We had a labor dispute two years ago in Cork. She was part of the team that went over to negotiate a settlement. She lobbied in Washington about flatpanel display tariffs. And I know she headed the Ops Review Team in Cupertino, which approved the plans for the new plant at Kuala Lumpur.\" \"Yes, exactly.\" \"But I don\u0027t know that her involvement goes beyond that.\" \"Ali. Well. Perhaps I was given wrong information,\" Daly said, shifting in his chair. \"What did you hear?\" \"Without going into specifics, let me say a question of judgment was raised.\" \"I see,\" Sanders said. Who would have said anything to Daly about Meredith? Certainly not Garvin or Blackburn. Kaplan? It was impossible to know for sure. But Daly would be talking only to highly placed officers. \"I was wondering,\" Daly said, \"if you had any thoughts on her technical judgment. Speaking privately, of course.\" At that moment, Sanders\u0027s computer screen beeped three times. A message flashed: ONE MINUTE TO DIRECT VIDEO LINKUP: DC/M-DC/S SEN: A. KAHN REC: T. SANDERS Daly said, \"Is something wrong?\" \"No,\" Sanders said. \"It looks like I have a video feed coming in from Malaysia.\" \"Then I\u0027ll be brief and leave you to it,\" Daly said. \"Let me put it to you directly. Within your division, is there any concern whether Meredith Johnson is qualified for this post?\" Sanders shrugged. \"She\u0027s the new boss. You know how organizations are. There\u0027s always concern with a new boss.\" \"You\u0027re very diplomatic. I mean to say, is there concern about her expertise? She\u0027s relatively young, after all. Geographic move, uprooting. New faces, new staffing, new problems. And up here, she won\u0027t be so directly under Bob Garvin\u0027s, ah, wing.\" \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" Sanders said. \"We\u0027ll all have to wait and see.\" \"And I gather that there was trouble in the past when a nontechnical person headed the division . . . a man named, ah, Screamer Freeling?\" \"Yes. He didn\u0027t work out.\" \"And there are similar concerns about Johnson?\" Sanders said, \"I\u0027ve heard them expressed.\" \"And her fiscal measures? These cost-containment plans of hers? That\u0027s the crux, isn\u0027t it?\" Sanders thought: what cost-containment plans? The screen beeped again. 30 SECONDS TO DIRECT VIDEO LINKUP: DC/M-DC/S \"There goes your machine again,\" Daly said, unfolding himself from the chair. \"I\u0027ll let you go. Thank you for your time, Mr. Sanders.\" \"Not at all.\" They shook hands. Daly turned and walked out of the room. Sanders\u0027s computer beeped three times in rapid succession: 15 SECONDS TO DIRECT VIDEO LINKUP: DC/M-DC/S He sat down in front of the monitor and twisted his desk lamp so that the light shone on his face. The numbers on the computer were counting backward. Sanders looked at his watch. It was five o\u0027clock-eight o\u0027clock in Malaysia. Arthur would probably be calling from the plant. A small rectangle appeared in the center of the screen and grew outward in progressive jumps. He saw Arthur\u0027s face, and behind him, the brightly lit assembly line. Brand-new, it was the epitome of modern manufacturing: clean and quiet, the workers in street clothes, arranged on both sides of the green conveyor belt. At each workstation there was a bank of fluorescent lights, which flared a little in the camera. Kahn coughed and rubbed his chin. \"Hello, Tom. How are you?\" When he spoke, his image blurred slightly. And his voice was out of sync, since the bounce to the satellite caused a slight delay in the video, but the voice was transmitted immediately. This unsynchronized quality was very distracting for the first few seconds; it gave the linkup a dreamy quality. It was a little like talking to someone under water. Then you got used to it. \"I\u0027m fine, Arthur,\" he said. \"Well, good. I\u0027m sorry about the new organization. You know how I feel personally.\" \"Thank you, Arthur.\" He wondered vaguely how Kahn in Malaysia would have heard already. But in any company, gossip traveled fast. \"Yeah. Well. Anyway, Tom, I\u0027m standing here on the floor,\" Kahn said, gesturing behind him. \"And as you can see, we\u0027re still running very slow. And the spot checks are unimproved. What do the designers say? Have they gotten the units yet?\" \"They came today. I don\u0027t have any news yet. They\u0027re still working on it.\" \"Uh-huh. Okay. And have the units gone to Diagnostics?\" Kahn asked. \"I think so. Just went.\" \"Yeah. Okay. Because we got a request from Diagnostics for ten more drive units to be sent in heat-sealed plastic bags. And they specified that they wanted them sealed inside the factory. Right as they came off the line. You know anything about that?\" \"No, this is the first I heard of it. Let me find out, and I\u0027ll get back to you.\" \"Okay, because I have to tell you, it seemed strange to me. I mean, ten units is a lot. Customs is going to query it if we send them all together. And I don\u0027t know what this sealing is about. We send them wrapped in plastic anyway. But not sealed. Why do they want them sealed, Tom?\" Kahn sounded worried. \"I don\u0027t know,\" Sanders said. \"I\u0027ll get into it. All I can think is that it\u0027s a full-court press around here. People really want to know why the hell those drives don\u0027t work.\" \"Hey, us too,\" Kahn said. \"Believe me. It\u0027s making us crazy.\" \"When will you send the drives?\" \"Well, I\u0027ve got to get a heat-sealer first. I hope I can ship Wednesday, you can have them Thursday.\" \"Not good enough,\" Sanders said. \"You should ship today, or tomorrow at the latest. You want me to run down a sealer for you? I can probably get one from Apple.\" Apple had a factory in Kuala Lumpur. \"No. That\u0027s a good idea. I\u0027ll call over there and see if Ron can loan me one. \"Fine. Now what about Jafar?\" \"Hell of a thing,\" Kahn said. \"I just talked to the hospital, and apparently he\u0027s got cramps and vomiting. Won\u0027t eat anything. The abo doctors say they can\u0027t figure out anything except, you know, a spell.\" \"They believe in spells?\" \"Damn right,\" Kahn said. \"They\u0027ve got laws against sorcery here. You can take people to court.\" \"So you don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll be back?\" \"Nobody\u0027s saying. Apparently he\u0027s really sick.\" \"Okay, Arthur. Anything else?\" \"No. I\u0027ll get the sealer. And let me know what you find out.\" \"I will,\" Sanders said, and the transmission ended. Kahn gave a final wave, and the screen went blank. SAVE THIS TRANSMISSION TO DISK OR DAT? He clicked DAT, and it was saved to digital tape. He got up from the desk. Whatever all this was about, he\u0027d better be informed before he had his meeting with Johnson at six. He went to the outer area, to Cindy\u0027s desk. Cindy was turned away, laughing on the phone. She looked back and saw Sanders, and stopped laughing. \"Listen, I got to go.\" Sanders said, \"Would you mind pulling the production reports on Twinkle for the last two months? Better yet, just pull everything since they opened the line.\" \"Sure.\" \"And call Don Cherry for me. I need to know what his Diagnostics group is doing with the drives.\" He went back into his office. He noticed his e-mail cursor was blinking, and pushed the key to read them. While he waited, he looked at the three faxes on his desk. Two were from Ireland, routine weekly production reports. The third was a requisition for a roof repair at the Austin plant; it had been held up in Operations in Cupertino, and Eddie had forwarded it to Sanders to try and get action. The screen blinked. He looked up at the first of his e-mail messages. OUT OF NOWHERE WE GOT A BEAN COUNTER FROM OPERATIONS DOWN HERE IN AUSTIN. HE\u0027S GOING OVER ALL THE BOOKS, DRIVING PEOPLE MAD. AND THE WORD IS WE GOT MORE COMING DOWN TOMORROW. WHAT GIVES? THE RUMORS ARE FLYING, AND SLOWING HELL OUT OF THE LINE. TELL ME WHAT TO SAY. IS THIS COMPANY FOR SALE OR NOT? EDDIE Sanders did not hesitate. He couldn\u0027t tell Eddie what was going on. Quickly, he typed his reply: THE BEAN COUNTERS WERE IN IRELAND LAST WEEK, TOO. GARVIN\u0027S ORDERED A COMPANY-WIDE REVIEW, AND THEY\u0027RE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING. TELL EVERYBODY DOWN THERE TO FORGET IT AND GO BACK TO WORK. TOM He pushed the SEND button. The message disappeared. \"You called?\" Don Cherry walked into the room without knocking, and dropped into the chair. He put his hands behind his head. `Jesus, what a day. I\u0027ve been putting out fires all afternoon.\" \"Tell me.\" \"I got some dweebs from Conley down there, asking my guys what the difference is between RAM and ROM. Like they have time for this. Pretty soon, one of the dweebs hears `flash memory\u0027 and he goes, `How often does it flash?\u0027 Like it was a flashlight or something. And my guys have to put up with this. I mean, this is high-priced talent. They shouldn\u0027t be doing remedial classes for lawyers. Can\u0027t you stop it?\" \"Nobody can stop it,\" Sanders said. \"Maybe Meredith can stop it,\" Cherry said, grinning. Sanders shrugged. \"She\u0027s the boss.\" \"Yeah. Sowhat\u0027s on your mind?\" \"Your Diagnostics group is working on the Twinkle drives.\" \"True. That is, we\u0027re working on the bits and pieces that\u0027re left after Lewyn\u0027s nimble-fingered artistes tore the hell out of them. Why did they go to design first? Never, ever, let a designer near an actual piece of electronic equipment, Tom. Designers should only be allowed to draw pictures on pieces of paper. And only give them one piece of paper at a time.\" \"What have you found?\" Sanders said. \"About the drives.\" \"Nothing yet,\" Cherry said. \"But we got a few ideas we\u0027re kicking around.\" \"Is that why you asked Arthur Kahn to send you ten drives, heatsealed from the factory?\" \"You bet your ass.\" \"Kahn was wondering about that.\" \"So?\" Cherry said. \"Let him wonder. It\u0027ll do him good. Keep him from playing with himself.\" \"I\u0027d like to know, too.\" \"Well look,\" Cherry said. \"Maybe our ideas won\u0027t amount to anything. At the moment, all we have is one suspicious chip. That\u0027s all Lewyn\u0027s clowns left us. It\u0027s not very much to go on.\" \"The chip is bad?\" \"No, the chip is fine.\" \"What\u0027s suspicious about it?\" \"Look,\" Cherry said. \"We\u0027ve got enough rumors flying around as it is. I can report that we\u0027re working on it, and we don\u0027t know yet. That\u0027s alt. We\u0027ll get the sealed drives tomorrow or Wednesday, and we should know within an hour. Okay?\" \"You thinking big problem, or little problem? I\u0027ve got to know,\" Sanders said. \"It\u0027s going to come up in the meetings tomorrow.\" \"Well, at the moment, the answer is we don\u0027t know. It could be anything. We\u0027re working on it.\" \"Arthur thinks it might be serious.\" \"Arthur might be right. But we\u0027ll solve it. That\u0027s all I can tell you.\" \"Don . . .\" \"I understand you want an answer,\" Cherry said. \"Do you understand that I don\u0027t have one?\" Sanders stared at him. \"You could have called. Why\u0027d you come up in person?\" \"Since you asked,\" Cherry said, \"I\u0027ve got a small problem. It\u0027s delicate. Sexual harassment thing.\" \"Another one? It seems like that\u0027s all we have around here.\" \"Us and everybody else,\" Cherry said. \"I hear UniCom\u0027s got fourteen suits going right now. Digital Graphics has even more. And MicroSym, look out. They\u0027re all pigs over there, anyway. But I\u0027d like your read on this.\" Sanders sighed. \"Okay.\" \"In one of my programming groups, the remote DB access group. The group\u0027s all pretty old: twenty-five to twenty-nine years old. The supervisor for the fax modem team, a woman, has been asking one of the guys out. She thinks he\u0027s cute. He keeps turning her down. Today she asks him again in the parking lot at lunch; he says no. She gets in her car, rams his car, drives off. Nobody hurt, and he doesn\u0027t want to make a complaint. But he\u0027s worried, thinks it\u0027s a little out of hand. Comes to me for advice. What should I do?\" Sanders frowned. \"You think that\u0027s the whole story? She\u0027s just mad at him because he turned her down? Or did he do something to provoke this?\" \"He says no. He\u0027s a pretty straight guy. A little geeky, not real sophisticated.\" \"And the woman?\" \"She\u0027s got a temper, no question. She blows at the team sometimes. I\u0027ve had to talk to her about that.\" \"What does she say about the incident in the parking lot?\" \"Don\u0027t know. The guy\u0027s asked me not to talk to her. Says he\u0027s embarrassed and doesn\u0027t want to make it worse.\" Sanders shrugged. \"What can you do? People are upset but nobody will talk . . . I don\u0027t know, Don. If a woman rammed his car, I\u0027d guess he must have done something. Chances are he slept with her once, and won\u0027t see her again, and now she\u0027s pissed. That\u0027s my guess.\" \"That would be my guess, too,\" Cherry said, \"but of course, maybe not. \"Damage to the car?\" \"Nothing serious. Broken taillight. He just doesn\u0027t want it to get any worse. So, do I drop it?\" \"If he won\u0027t file charges, I\u0027d drop it.\" \"Do I speak to her informally?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t. You go accusing her of impropriety-even informally-and you\u0027re asking for trouble. Nobody\u0027s going to support you. Because the chances are, your guy did do something to provoke her.\" \"Even though he says he didn\u0027t.\" Sanders sighed. \"Listen, Don, they always say they didn\u0027t. I never heard of one who said, `You know, I deserve this.\u0027 Never happens.\" \"So, drop it\u0027,\" \"Put a note in the file that he told you the story, be sure you characterize the story as alleged, and forget it.\" Cherry nodded, turned to leave. At the door, he stopped and looked back. \"So tell me this. How come we\u0027re both so convinced this guy must have done something?\" `Just playing the odds,\" Sanders said. \"Now fix that damned drive for me.\" A six o\u0027clock, he said good night to Cindy and took the Twinkle files up to Meredith\u0027s office on the fifth floor. The sun was still high in the sky, streaming through the windows. It seemed like late afternoon, not the end of the day. Meredith had been given the big corner office, where Ron Goldman used to be. Meredith had a new assistant, too, a woman. Sanders guessed she had followed her boss up from Cupertino. \"I\u0027m Tom Sanders,\" he said. \"I have an appointment with Ms. Johnson.\" \"Betsy Ross, from Cupertino, Mr. Sanders,\" she said. She looked at him. \"Don\u0027t say anything.\" \"Okay.\" \"Everybody says something. Something about the flag. I get really sick of it.\" \"Okay.\" \"My whole life.\" \"Okay. Fine.\" \"I\u0027ll tell Miss Johnson you\u0027re here.\" Tom.\" Meredith Johnson waved from behind her desk, her other hand holding the phone. \"Come in, sit down.\" Her office had a view north toward downtown Seattle: the Space Needle, the Arly towers, the SODO building. The city looked glorious in the afternoon sun. \"I\u0027ll just finish this up.\" She turned back to the phone. \"Yes, Ed, I\u0027m with Tom now, we\u0027ll go over all of that. Yes. He\u0027s brought the documentation with him.\" Sanders held up the manila folder containing the drive data. She pointed to her briefcase, which was lying open on the corner of the desk, and gestured for him to put it inside. She turned back to the phone. \"Yes, Ed, I think the due diligence will go smoothly, and there certainly isn\u0027t any impulse to hold anything back . . . No, no . . . Well, we can do it first thing in the morning if you like.\" Sanders put the folder in her briefcase. Meredith was saying, \"Right, Ed, right. Absolutely.\" She came toward Tom and sat with one hip on the edge of the desk, her navy blue skirt riding up her thigh. She wasn\u0027t wearing stockings. \"Everybody agrees that this is important, Ed. Yes.\" She swung her foot, the high heel dangling from her toe. She smiled at Sanders. He felt uncomfortable, and moved back a little. \"I promise you, Ed. Yes. Absolutely.\" Meredith hung up the phone on the cradle behind her, leaning back across the desk, twisting her body, revealing her breasts beneath the silk blouse. \"Well, that\u0027s done.\" She sat forward again, and sighed. \"The Conley people heard there\u0027s trouble with Twinkle. That was Ed Nichols, flipping out. Actually, it\u0027s the third call I\u0027ve had about Twinkle this afternoon. You\u0027d think that was all there was to this company. How do you like the office?\" \"Pretty good,\" he said. \"Great view.\" \"Yes, the city\u0027s beautiful.\" She leaned on one arm and crossed her legs. She saw that he noticed, and said, \"In the summer, I\u0027d rather not wear stockings. I like the bare feeling. So much cooler on a hot day.\" Sanders said, \"From now to the end of summer, it will be pretty much this way.\" \"I have to tell you, I dread the weather,\" she said. \"I mean, after California . . .\" She uncrossed her legs again, and smiled. \"But you like it here, don\u0027t you? You seem happy here.\" \"Yes.\" He shrugged. \"You get used to rain.\" He pointed to her briefcase. \"Do you want to go over the Twinkle stuff?\" \"Absolutely,\" she said, sliding off the desk, coming close to him. She looked him directly in the eyes. \"But I hope you don\u0027t mind if I impose on you first. Just a little?\" \"Sure.\" She stepped aside. \"Pour the wine for us.\" \"Okay.\" \"See if it\u0027s chilled long enough.\" He went over to the bottle on the side table. \"I remember you always liked it cold.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" he said, spinning the bottle in the ice. He didn\u0027t like it so cold anymore, but he did in those days. \"We had a lot of fun back then,\" she said. \"Yes,\" he said. \"We did.\" \"1 swear,\" she said. \"Sometimes I think that back when we were both young and trying to make it, I think that was the best it ever was.\" He hesitated, not sure how to answer her, what tone to take. He poured the wine. \"Yes,\" she said. \"We had a good time. I think about it often.\" Sanders thought: I never do. She said, \"What about you, Tom? Do you think about it?\" \"Of course.\" He crossed the room carrying the glasses of wine to her, gave her one, clinked them. \"Sure I do. All us married guys think of the old days. You know I\u0027m married now.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-6.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ...
