{"id":74931,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Four-three sucks. Get it above five, or you\u0027re fired.\" He turned to Sanders. \"You\u0027ve got to encourage the troops.\"\n Sanders looked at Cherry. \"All right,\" he said finally. \"Now what\u0027s the real problem?\"\n Cherry shrugged. \"Nothing. I told you: fine-tuning.\"\n \"Don.\"\n Cherry sighed. \"Well, when we jumped the refresh rate, we trashed the builder module. You see, the room is being built in real time by the box. With a faster refresh off the sensors, we have to build objects much faster. Otherwise the room seems to lag behind you. You feel like you\u0027re drunk. You move your head, and the room swooshes behind you, catching up.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"And, it makes the users throw up.\"\n Sanders sighed. \"Great.\"\n \"We had to take the walker pads apart because Teddy barfed all over everything.\"\n \"Great, Don.\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter? It\u0027s no big deal. It cleans up.\" Ile shook his head. \"Although I do wish Teddy hadn\u0027t eaten huevos rancheros for breakfast. That was unfortunate. Little bits of tortilla everywhere in the bearings.\"\n \"You know we have a demo tomorrow for the C-W people.\"\n \"No problem. We\u0027ll be ready.\"\n \"Don, I can\u0027t have their top executives throwing up.\"\n \"Trust me,\" Cherry said. \"We\u0027ll be ready. They\u0027re going to love it. Whatever problems this company has, the Corridor is not one of them.\"\n \"That\u0027s a promise?\"\n \"That,\" Cherry said, \"is a guarantee.\"\n Sanders was back in his office by ten-twenty, and was seated at his desk when Gary Bosak came in. Bosak was a tall man in his twenties, wearing jeans, running shoes, and a Terminator T-shirt. He carried a large fold-over leather briefcase, the kind that trial attorneys used.\n \"You look pale,\" Bosak said. \"But everybody in the building is pale today. It\u0027s tense as hell around here, you know that?\"\n \"I\u0027ve noticed.\"\n \"Yeah, I bet. Okay to start?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"Cindy? Mr. Sanders is going to be unavailable for a few minutes.\"\n Bosak closed the office door and locked it. Whistling cheerfully, he unplugged Sanders\u0027s desk phone, and the phone beside the couch in the corner. From there, he went to the window and closed the blinds. There was a small television in the corner; he turned it on. He snapped the latches on his briefcase, took out a small plastic box, and flipped the switch on the side. The box began to blink, and emitted a low white noise hiss. Bosak set it in the middle of Sanders\u0027s desk. Bosak never gave information until the white noise scrambler was in place, since most of what he had to say implied illegal behavior.\n \"I have good news for you,\" Bosak said. \"Your boy is clean.\" He pulled out a manila file, opened it up, and started handing over pages. \"Peter John Nealy, twenty three, DigiCom employee for sixteen months. Now working as a programmer in APG. Okay, here we go. His high school and college transcripts . . . Employment file from Data General, his last employer. All in order. Now, the recent stuff... Credit rating from TRW . . . Phone bills from his apartment . . . Phone bills for his cellular line . . . Bank statement . . . Savings account . . . Last two 1040s . . . Twelve months of credit card charges, VISA and Master . . . Travel records . . . E-mail messages inside the company, and off the Internet . . . Parking tickets . . . And this is the clincher . . . Ramada Inn in Sunnyvale, last three visits, his phone charges there, the numbers he called . . . Last three car rentals with mileage . . . Rental car cellular phone, the numbers called . . . That\u0027s everything.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"I ran down the numbers he called. here\u0027s the breakdown. A lot of calls to Seattle Silicon, but Nealy\u0027s seeing a girl there. She\u0027s a secretary, works in sales, no conflict. He also calls his brother, a programmer at Boeing, does parallel processing stuff for wing design, no conflict. His other calls are to suppliers and code vendors, and they\u0027re all appropriate. No calls after hours. No calls to pay phones. No overseas calls. No suspicious pattern in the calls. No unexplained bank transfers, no sudden new purchases. No reason to think he\u0027s looking for a move. I\u0027d say he\u0027s not talking to anybody you care about.\"\n \"Good,\" Sanders said. He glanced down at the sheets of paper, and paused. \"Gary . . . Some of this stuff is from our company. Some of these reports.\"\n \"Yeah. So?\"\n \"How\u0027d you get them?\"\n Bosak grinned. \"Hey. You don\u0027t ask and I don\u0027t tell you.\"\n \"How\u0027d you get the Data General file?\"\n Bosak shook his head. \"Isn\u0027t this why you pay me?\"\n \"Yes it is, but-\"\n \"Hey. You wanted a check on an employee, you got it. Your kid\u0027s clean. He\u0027s working only for you. Anything else you want to know about him?\"\n \"No.\" Sanders shook his head.\n \"Great. I got to get some sleep.\" Bosak collected all the files and placed them back in his folder. \"By the way, you\u0027re going to get a call from my parole officer.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Can I count on you?\"\n \"Sure, Gary.\"\n \"I told him I was doing consulting for you. On telecommunications security.\"\n \"And so you are.\"\n Bosak switched off the blinking box, put it in his briefcase, and reconnected the telephones. \"Always a pleasure. Do I leave the bill with you, or Cindy?\"\n \"I\u0027ll take it. See you, Gary.\"\n \"Hey. Anytime. You need more, you know where I am.\"\n Sanders glanced at the bill, from NE Professional Services, Inc., of Bellevue, Washington. The name was Bosak\u0027s private joke: the letters NE stood for \"Necessary Evil.\" Ordinarily, high-tech companies employed retired police officers and private investigators to do background checks, but occasionally they used hackers like Gary Bosak, who could gain access to electronic data banks, to get information on suspect employees. The advantage of using; Bosak was that he could work quickly, often making a report in a matter of hours, or overnight. Bosak\u0027s methods were of course illegal; simply by hiring him, Sanders himself had broken a half-dozen laws. But background checks on employees were accepted as standard practice in high-tech firms, where a single document or product development plan might be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to competitors.\n And in the case of Pete Nealy, a check was particularly crucial. Nealy was developing hot new compression algorithms to pack and unpack video images onto CD-ROM laser disks. His work was vital to the new Twinkle technology. High-speed digital images coming off the disk were going to transform a sluggish technology and produce a revolution in education. But if Twinkle\u0027s algorithms became available to a competitor, then DigiCom\u0027s advantage would be greatly reduced, and that meant\n The intercom buzzed. \"Tom,\" Cindy said. \"It\u0027s eleven o\u0027clock. Time for the APG meeting. You want the agenda on your way down?\"\n \"Not today,\" he said. \"I think I know what we\u0027ll be talking about.\"\n In the third-floor conference room, the Advanced Products Group was already meeting. This was a weekly meeting in which the division heads discussed problems and brought everyone up to date. It was a meeting that Sanders ordinarily led. Around the table were Don Cherry, the chief of Programming; Mark Lewyn, the temperamental head of Product Design, all in black Armani; and Mary Anne Hunter, the head of Data Telecommunications. Petite and intense, Hunter was dressed in a sweatshirt, shorts, and Nike running tights; she never ate lunch, but ordinarily went on a five-mile run after each meeting.\n Lewyn was in the middle of one of his storming rages: \"It\u0027s insulting to everybody in the division. I have no idea why she got this position. I don\u0027t know what her qualifications could be for a job like this, and-\"\n Lewyn broke off as Sanders came into the room. There was an awkward moment. Everyone was silent, glancing at him, then looking away.\n \"I had a feeling,\" Sanders said, smiling, \"you\u0027d be talking about this.\"\n The room remained silent. \"Come on,\" he said, as he slipped into a chair. \"It\u0027s not a funeral.\"\n Mark Lewyn cleared his throat. \"I\u0027m sorry, Tom. I think it\u0027s an outrage.\"\n Mary Anne Hunter said, \"Everybody knows it should have been you.\"\n Lewyn said, \"It\u0027s a shock to all of us, Tom.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Cherry said, grinning. \"We\u0027ve been trying like hell to get you sacked, but we never really thought it would work.\"\n \"I appreciate all this,\" Sanders said, \"but it\u0027s Garvin\u0027s company, and he can do what he wants with it. He\u0027s been right more often than not. And I\u0027m a big boy. Nobody ever promised me anything.\"\n Lewyn said, \"You\u0027re really okay with this?\"\n \"Believe me. I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"You talked with Garvin?\"\n \"I talked with Phil.\"\n Lewyn shook his head. \"That sanctimonious asshole.\"\n \"Listen,\" Cherry said, \"did Phil say anything about the spin-off?\"\n \"Yes,\" Sanders said. \"The spin-off is still happening. Eighteen months after the merger, they\u0027ll structure the IPO, and take the division public.\"\n There were little shrugs around the table. Sanders could see they were relieved. Going public meant a lot of money to all the people sitting in the room.\n \"And what did Phil say about Ms. Johnson?\"\n \"Not much. Just that she\u0027s Garvin\u0027s choice to head up the technical side.\"\n At that moment Stephanie Kaplan, DigiCom\u0027s Chief Financial Officer, came into the room. A tall woman with prematurely gray hair and a notably silent manner, she was known as Stephanie Stealth, or the Stealth Bomberthe latter a reference to her habit of quietly killing projects she did not consider profitable enough. Kaplan was based in Cupertino, but she generally sat in once a month on the Seattle division meetings. Lately, she had been up more often.\n Lewyn said, \"`M\u0027e\u0027re trying to cheer up Tom, Stephanie.\"\n Kaplan took a seat, and gave Sanders a sympathetic smile. She didn\u0027t speak.\n Lewyn said, \"Did you know this Meredith Johnson appointment was coming?\"\n \"No,\" Kaplan said. \"It was a surprise to everybody. And not everybody\u0027s happy about it.\" Then, as if she had said too much, she opened her briefcase, and busied herself with her notes. As usual, she slid into the background; the others quickly ignored her.\n \"Well,\" Cherry said, \"I hear Garvin\u0027s got a real thing for her. Johnson\u0027s only been with the company four years, and she hasn\u0027t been especially outstanding. But Garvin took her under his wing. Two years ago, he began moving her up, fast. For some reason, he just thinks Meredith Johnson is great.\u0027\u0027\n Lewyn said, \"Is Garvin fucking her?\"\n \"No, he just likes her.\"\n \"She must be fucking somebody.\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Mary Anne Hunter said, sitting up. \"What\u0027s this? If Garvin brought in some guy from Microsoft to run this division, nobody\u0027d say he must be fucking somebody.\"\n Cherry laughed. \"It\u0027d depend on who he was.\"\n \"I\u0027m serious. Why is it when a woman gets a promotion, she must be fucking somebody?\"\n Lewyn said, \"Look: if they brought in Ellen Howard from Microsoft, we wouldn\u0027t be having this conversation because we all know Ellen\u0027s very competent. We wouldn\u0027t like it, but we\u0027d accept it. But nobody even knows Meredith Johnson. I mean, does anybody here know her?\"\n \"Actually,\" Sanders said, \"I know her.\"\n There was silence.\n \"I used to go out with her.\"\n Cherry laughed. \"So you\u0027re the one she\u0027s fucking.\"\n Sanders shook his head. \"It was years ago.\"\n Hunter said, \"What\u0027s she like?\"\n \"Yeah,\" Cherry said, grinning lasciviously. \"What\u0027s she like?\"\n \"Shut up, Don.\"\n \"Lighten up, Mary Anne.\"\n \"She worked for Novell when I knew her,\" Sanders said. \"She was about twentyfive. Smart and ambitious.\"\n \"Smart and ambitious,\" Lewyn said. \"That\u0027s fine. The world\u0027s full of smart and ambitious. The question is, can she run a technical division? Or have we got another Screamer Freeling on our hands?\"\n Two years earlier, Garvin had put a sales manager named Howard Freeling in charge of the division. The idea was to bring product development in contact with customers at an earlier point, to develop new products more in line with the emerging market. Freeling instituted focus groups, and they all spent a lot of time watching potential customers play with new products behind one-way glass.\n But Freeling was completely unfamiliar with technical issues. So when confronted with a problem, he screamed. He was like a tourist in a foreign country who didn\u0027t speak the language and thought he could make the locals understand by shouting at them. Freeling\u0027s tenure at APG was a disaster. The programmers loathed him; the designers rebelled at his idea for neon-colored product boxes; the manufacturing glitches at factories in Ireland and Texas didn\u0027t get solved. Finally, when the production line in Cork went down for eleven days, Freeling flew over and screamed. The Irish managers all quit, and Garvin fired him.\n \"So: is that what we have? Another Screamer?\"\n Stephanie Kaplan cleared her throat. \"I think Garvin learned his lesson. Ile wouldn\u0027t make the same mistake twice.\"\n \"So you think Meredith Johnson is up to the job?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t say,\" Kaplan replied, speaking very deliberately.\n \"Not much of an endorsement,\" Lewyn said.\n \"But I think she\u0027ll be better than Freeling,\" Kaplan said.\n Lewyn snorted. \"This is the Taller Than Mickey Rooney Award. N ou can still be very short and win.\"\n \"No,\" Kaplan said, \"I think she\u0027ll be better.\"\n Cherry said, \"Better-looking, at least, from what I hear.\"\n \"Sexist,\" Mary Anne Hunter said.\n \"What: I can\u0027t say she\u0027s good-looking?\"\n \"We\u0027re talking about her competence, not her appearance.\"\n \"Wait a minute,\" Cherry said. \"Coming over here to this meeting, I pass the women at the espresso bar, and what are they talking about? Whether Richard Gere has better buns than Mel Gibson. They\u0027re talking about the crack in the ass, lift and separate, all that stuff. I don\u0027t see why they can talk about-\"\n \"We\u0027re drifting afield,\" Sanders said.\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter what you guys say,\" Hunter said, \"the fact is, this company is dominated by males; there are almost no women except Stephanie in high executive positions. I think it\u0027s great that Bob has appointed a woman to run this division, and I for one think we should support her.\" She looked at Sanders. \"We all love you, Tom, but you know what I mean.\"\n \"Yeah, we all love you,\" Cherry said. \"At least, we did until we got our cute new boss.\"\n Lewyn said, \"I\u0027ll support Johnsonif she\u0027s any good.\"\n \"No you won\u0027t,\" Hunter said. \"You\u0027ll sabotage her. You\u0027ll find a reason to get rid of her.\"\n \"Wait a minute\"\n \"No. What is this conversation really about? It\u0027s about the fact that you\u0027re all pissed off because now you have to report to a woman.\"\n \"Mary Anne . . .\"\n \"I mean it.\"\n Lewyn said, \"I think Tom\u0027s pissed off because he didn\u0027t get the job.\" \"I\u0027m not pissed off,\" Sanders said.\n \"Well, I\u0027m pissed off,\" Cherry said, \"because Meredith used to be Tom\u0027s girlfriend, so now he has a special in with the new boss.\"\n \"Maybe.\" Sanders frowned.\n Lewyn said, \"On the other hand, maybe she hates you. All my old girlfriends hate me.\"\n \"With good reason, I hear,\" Cherry said, laughing.\n Sanders said, \"Let\u0027s get back to the agenda, shall we?\"\n \"What agenda?\"\n \"Twinkle.\"\n There were groans around the table. \"Not again.\"\n \"Goddamn Twinkle.\"\n \"How bad is it?\" Cherry said.\n \"They still can\u0027t get the seek times down, and they can\u0027t solve the hinge problems. The line\u0027s running at twenty-nine percent.\"\n Lewyn said, \"They better send us some units.\"\n \"We should have them today.\"\n \"Okay. Table it till then?\"\n \"It\u0027s okay with me.\" Sanders looked around the table. \"Anybody else have a problem? Mary Anne?\"\n \"No, we\u0027re fine. We still expect prototype card-phones off our test line within two months.\"\n The new generation of cellular telephones were not much larger than a credit card. They folded open for use. \"How\u0027s the weight?\"\n \"The weight\u0027s now four ounces, which is not great, but okay. The problem is power. The batteries only run 180 minutes in talk mode. And the keypad sticks when you dial. But that\u0027s Mark\u0027s headache. We\u0027re on schedule with the line.\"\n \"Good.\" He turned to Don Cherry. \"And how\u0027s the Corridor?\"\n Cherry sat back in his chair, beaming. He crossed his hands over his belly. \"I am pleased to report,\" he said, \"that as of half an hour ago, the Corridor is fan-fuckingtastic.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"That\u0027s great news.\"\n \"Nobody\u0027s throwing up?\"\n \"Please. Ancient history.\"\n Mark Lewyn said, \"Wait a minute. Somebody threw up?\"\n \"A vile rumor. That was then. This is now. We got the last delay bug out half an hour ago, and all functions are now fully implemented. We can take any database and convert it into a 3-D z4-bit color environment that you can navigate in real time. You can walk through any database in the world.\" \"And it\u0027s stable?\" \"It\u0027s a rock.\" \"You\u0027ve tried it with naive users?\" \"Bulletproof.\" \"So you\u0027re ready to demo for Conley?\" \"We\u0027ll blow \u0027em away,\" Cherry said. \"They won\u0027t fucking believe their eyes.\"\n Coming out of the conference room, Sanders ran into a group of Conley-White executives being taken on a tour by Bob Garvin.\n Robert T. Garvin looked the way every CEO wanted to look in the pages of Fortune magazine. He was fifty-nine years old and handsome, with a craggy face and salt-and-pepper hair that always looked windblown, as if he\u0027d just come in from a fly-fishing trip in Montana, or a weekend sailing in the San Juans. In the old days, like everyone else, he had worn jeans and denim work shirts in the office. But in recent years, he favored dark blue Caracem suits. It was one of the many changes that people in the company had noticed since the death of his daughter, three years before.\n Brusque and profane in private, Garvin was all charm in public. Leading the Conley-White executives, he said, \"Here on the third floor, you have our tech divisions and advanced product laboratories. Oh, Tom. Good.\" He threw his arm around Sanders. \"Meet Tom Sanders, our division manager for advanced products. One of the brilliant young men who\u0027s made our company what it is. Tom, say hello to Ed Nichols, the CFO for Conley-White . . .\"\n A thin, hawk-faced man in his late fifties, Nichols carried his head tilted back, so that he seemed to be pulling away from everything, as if there were a bad smell. He looked down his nose through half-frame glasses at Sanders, regarding him with a vaguely disapproving air, and shook hands formally.\n \"Mr. Sanders. How do you do.\"\n \"Mr. Nichols.\"\n \". . . and John Conley, nephew of the founder, and vice president of the firm . . .\"\n Sanders turned to a stocky, athletic man in his late twenties. Wireframe spectacles. Armani suit. Firm handshake. Serious expression. Sanders had the impression of a wealthy and very determined man.\n \"Hi there, Tom.\"\n \"Hi, John.\"\n \". . . and Jim Daly, from Goldman, Sachs . . .\"\n A balding, thin, storklike man in a pinstripe suit. Daly seemed distracted, befuddled, and shook hands with a brief nod.\n ``. . . and of course, Meredith Johnson, from Cupertino.\"\n She was more beautiful than he had remembered. And different in some subtle way. Older, of course, crow\u0027s-feet at the corners of her eyes, and faint creases in her forehead. But she stood straighter now, and she had a vibrancy, a confidence, that he associated with power. Dark blue suit, blond hair, large eyes. Those incredibly long eyelashes. He had forgotten.\n \"Hello, Tom, nice to see you again.\" A warm smile. Her perfume.\n \"Meredith, nice to see you.\"\n She released his hand, and the group swept on, as Garvin led them down the hall. \"Now, just ahead is the VIE Unit. You\u0027ll be seeing that work tomorrow.\"\n Mark Lewyn came out of the conference room and said, \"You met the rogues\u0027 gallery?\"\n \"I guess so.\"\n Lewyn watched them go. \"Hard to believe those guys are going to be running this company,\" he said. \"I did a briefing this morning, and let me tell you, they don\u0027t know anything. It\u0027s scary.\"\n As the group reached the end of the hallway, Meredith Johnson looked back over her shoulder at Sanders. She mouthed, \"I\u0027ll call you.\" And she smiled radiantly. Then she was gone.\n Lewyn sighed. \"I\u0027d say,\" he said, \"that you have an in with top management there, Tom.\"\n \"Maybe so.\"\n \"I just wish I knew why Garvin thinks she\u0027s so great.\"\n Sanders said, \"Well, she certainly looks great.\"\n Lewyn turned away. \"We\u0027ll see,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll see.\"\n A twenty past twelve, Sanders left his office on the fourth floor and headed toward the stairs to go down to the main conference room for lunch. He passed a nurse in a starched white uniform. She was looking in one office after another. \"Where is he? He was just here a minute ago.\" She shook her head.\n \"Who?\" Sanders said.\n \"The professor,\" she replied, blowing a strand of hair out of her eyes. \"I can\u0027t leave him alone for a minute.\"\n \"What professor?\" Sanders said. But by then he heard the female giggles coming from a room farther down the hall, and he already knew the answer. \"Professor Dorfman?\"\n \"Yes. Professor Dorfman,\" the nurse said, nodding grimly, and she headed toward the source of the giggles.\n Sanders trailed after her. Max Dorfman was a German management consultant, now very elderly. At one time or another, he had been a visiting professor at every major business school in America, and he had gained a particular reputation as a guru to high-tech companies. During most of the 1980s, he had served on the board of directors of DigiCom, lending prestige to Garvin\u0027s upstart company. And during that time, he had been a mentor to Sanders. In fact, it was Dorfman who had convinced Sanders to leave Cupertino eight years earlier and take the job in Seattle.\n Sanders said, \"I didn\u0027t know he was still alive.\"\n \"Very much so,\" the nurse said.\n \"He must be ninety.\"\n \"Well, he doesn\u0027t act a day over eighty-five.\"\n As they approached the room, he saw Mary Anne Hunter coming out. She had changed into a skirt and blouse, and she was smiling broadly, as if she had just left her lover. \"Tom, you\u0027ll never guess who\u0027s here.\"\n \"Max,\" he said.\n \"That\u0027s right. Oh, Tom, you should see him: he\u0027s exactly the same.\" \"I\u0027ll bet he is,\" Sanders said. Even from outside the room, he could smell the cigarette smoke.\n The nurse said, \"Now, Professor,\" in a severe tone, and strode into the room. Sanders looked in; it was one of the employee lounges. Max Dorfman\u0027s wheelchair was pulled up to the table in the center of the room. He was surrounded by pretty assistants. The women were making a fuss over him, and in their midst Dorfman, with his shock of white hair, was grinning happily, smoking a cigarette in a long holder.\n \"What\u0027s he doing here?\" Sanders said.\n \"Garvin brought him in, to consult on the merger. Aren\u0027t you going to say hello?\" Hunter said.\n \"Oh, Christ,\" Sanders said. \"You know Max. He can drive you crazy.\" Dorfman liked to challenge conventional wisdom, but his method was indirect. He had an ironic way of speaking that was provocative and mocking at the same moment. He was fond of contradictions, and he did not hesitate to lie. If you caught him in a lie, he would immediately say, \"Yes, that\u0027s true. I don\u0027t know what I was thinking of,\" and then resume talking in the same maddening, elliptical way. He never really said what he meant; he left it for you to put it together. His rambling sessions left executives confused and exhausted.\n \"But you were such friends,\" Hunter said, looking at him. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027d like you to say hello.\"\n \"He\u0027s busy now. Maybe later.\" Sanders looked at his watch. \"Anyway, we\u0027re going to be late for lunch.\"\n He started back down the hallway. Hunter fell into step with him, frowning. \"He always got under your skin, didn\u0027t he?\"\n \"He got under everybody\u0027s skin. It was what he did best.\"\n She looked at him in a puzzled way, and seemed about to say more, then shrugged. \"It\u0027s okay with me.\"\n \"I\u0027m just not in the mood for one of those conversations,\" Sanders said. \"Maybe later. But not right now.\" They headed down the stairs to the ground floor.\n In keeping with the stripped-down functionality of modern high-tech firms, DigiCom maintained no corporate dining room. Instead, lunches and dinners were held at local restaurants, most often at the nearby 11 Terrazzo. But the need for secrecy about the merger obliged DigiCom to cater a lunch in the large, wood-paneled conference room on the ground floor. At twelve-thirty, with the principal managers of the DigiCom technical divisions, the Conley-White executives, and the Goldman, Sachs bankers all present, the room was crowded. The egalitarian ethos of the company meant that there was no assigned seating, but the principal C-W executives ended up at one side of the table near the front of the room, clustered around Garvin. The power end of the table.\n Sanders took a seat farther down on the opposite side, and was surprised when Stephanie Kaplan slid into the chair to his right. Kaplan usually sat much closer to Garvin; Sanders was distinctly further down the pecking order. To Sanders\u0027s left was Bill Everts, the head of Human Resourcesa nice, slightly dull guy. As white-coated waiters served the meal, Sanders talked about fishing on Orcas Island, which was Everts\u0027s passion. As usual, Kaplan was quiet during most of the lunch, seeming to withdraw into herself.\n Sanders began to feel he was neglecting her. Toward the end of the meal, he turned to her and said, \"I notice you\u0027ve been up here in Seattle more often the last few months, Stephanie. Is that because of the merger?\"\n \"No.\" She smiled. \"My son\u0027s a freshman at the university, so I like to come up because I get to see him.\"\n \"What\u0027s he studying?\"\n \"Chemistry. He wants to go into materials chemistry. Apparently it\u0027s going to be a big field.\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard that.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/disclosure/page-4.html","bookId":2410,"book":{"id":2410,"title":"Disclosure","description":"Storyline: \n The thriller that opened a new chapter in the sex wars ... \n Thomas Sanders\u0027 world collapses in just 24 hours – he is passed over for promotion, his new woman boss comes on to him during a drink after work, then, the next morning, he learns that she has accused him of sexually harassing her.
