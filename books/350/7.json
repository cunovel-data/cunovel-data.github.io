{"id":25796,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. ROBBED IN HIS SLEEP.","content":"Tom was right in concluding that Bill Crane\u0027s influence over Peabody was anything but good. The young Bostonian, however, was not long subjected to it. During the night following John Miles\u0027s departure, the little settlement at River Bend was called upon to deplore the loss of an eminent member. In brief, somewhere between midnight and dawn Mr. William Crane took his departure, without the ceremony of leave-taking. Had he gone alone no one perhaps would have felt any violent sorrow, but he took with him a horse belonging to Adam Dietrich, an industrious young German, who had only recently arrived. No one had seen the two go together, but it was only natural to suppose that Crane had spirited away the horse. Dietrich borrowed a horse, and, accompanied[Pg 57] by a friend, set out in search of the thief, but returned at night unsuccessful. Had it been wet weather, it might have been possible to track the fugitive; but it was very dry, and the trail was soon lost. It was almost impossible to tell what direction Crane would choose, and continued pursuit would not pay, so Adam sadly returned to his work. Little doubt was entertained among the miners that Crane was responsible for the loss of the horse. Had he been caught, there would have been small chance for him, so generally was he pronounced guilty. A few of his companions, especially Missouri Jack, defended him. \"Bill Crane wouldn\u0027t steal a horse any more than I would,\" said Jack; and there were those who agreed with him without acquitting Bill. \"Bill ain\u0027t no saint, but he ain\u0027t a thief.\" Whether Jack believed what he said, admits of a doubt. Crane needed a different advocate to clear him from suspicion. It may as well be stated that Crane did steal the horse. He had a decided objection to walking[Pg 58] as long as he could ride, and, having no animal of his own, annexed the property of his neighbor. He had two motives which influenced him to leave the settlement. First, he was in Tom\u0027s power, and he was by no means certain that our hero would keep silence touching his night-attempt at robbery. In the second place, he still coveted the bag of gold-dust which John Miles carried away with him. He had been prevented from taking it; but, as Miles was travelling alone, he foresaw a better chance of success if he should follow on his track. How or under what circumstances he should make the new attempt he left to be decided later. The first thing, obviously, was to overtake him. Crane experienced the same difficulty in tracking Miles that had led to the failure of his own pursuers. It was only on the fifth day, that, as he halted his steed on the hillside, and cast long glances about him, he caught sight, a mile away, of the object of his pursuit. He could not mistake[Pg 59] the sturdy, broad-shouldered figure, and large, massive head. \"That\u0027s Miles, sure enough!\" he exclaimed, joyfully. \"I thought I had missed him, but I\u0027m in luck. That bag must be mine.\" The most direct course was to ride up in the fashion of a highwayman, and demand the bag. But Crane did not mean to proceed in this fashion. Physically, though not a weak man, he was not a match for Miles, and he knew it. Cunning must supply the place of strength. He knew that Miles was a sound sleeper, and could think of no better plan than repeating the visit he had made in camp. It was already late in the afternoon when he caught sight of the sturdy miner. It was his policy now to keep him in sight, but not to approach near enough for recognition. Once seen, Miles would be on his guard, and the game would be spoiled. Crane halted, therefore, and drew back within the shadow of the trees, henceforth advancing cautiously. John Miles did not once turn back. Had he done so, it is quite possible that he might have[Pg 60] caught a glimpse of his pursuer. He had travelled since morning, and his faithful horse was beginning to show signs of fatigue. \"You are tired, my poor Dick,\" he said kindly, stroking the horse. \"You deserve supper and rest, and you shall have it.\" Dick appeared to understand what his rider said, for he gave a short neigh of satisfaction. John Miles looked around him. Just ahead was a large tree, under whose broad branches it would be pleasant to recline. Not far away was a slender mountain-stream trickling over the rocks. Nothing could have been better. Miles slid from his horse and made preparations to encamp for the night, first leading his faithful steed to the stream, where he quenched his thirst. Then he brought out his slender stock of provisions and partook of supper. \"It\u0027s pleasant to rest after a long day\u0027s ride,\" soliloquized Miles. \"I must have made forty miles to-day. I could easily have gone farther, had it been on the prairies at home, but these mountain-roads are hard upon man and beast.\"[Pg 61] After supper Miles threw himself upon the ground, and his mind became busy with his plans and prospects. \"I shall reach Frisco in three days, according to my calculations,\" he reflected; \"and then, first of all, I must attend to Tom\u0027s commission. That\u0027s a good boy, Tom. I wish he were here with me to-night. Why didn\u0027t I urge him to come with me? He is not doing very well where he is, and there are plenty of chances for a smart boy in the city. If I find any opening for him, I will send for him. I don\u0027t know what gives me such an interest in that boy, but I\u0027d sooner do him a good turn than any man I know. I hope that thief Crane won\u0027t play any trick upon him. If he does, I swear I\u0027ll get even with him.\" John Miles little suspected that he himself stood in more peril from the man he denounced than our hero. Had he known that Bill Crane was lurking in the vicinity, he would scarcely have courted slumber so fearlessly. Physical fatigue and the stillness of outward[Pg 62] nature speedily brought on a feeling of drowsiness that was not long in bringing sleep. Twilight had hardly given place to night when our traveller had become \"to dumb forgetfulness a prey.\" This was what Bill Crane had been waiting for. He rightly calculated that Miles would soon be asleep. He inferred this from his own feelings. He, too, had travelled many miles, and felt drowsy; but, with the object he had in view near accomplishment, he was able to resist the promptings of nature. Crane rode till he was but a few rods from Miles, then dismounted and tethered his horse. With stealthy step he approached the sleeper. With satisfaction he regarded the upturned face of the man whom, if waking, he would have feared, and noted his deep, regular breathing. \"You wouldn\u0027t sleep so sound, John Miles,\" he said to himself, \"if you knew I was standing over you. How easily I could put a bullet into you! But then I wouldn\u0027t have the satisfaction of anticipating your disappointment when you wake up and find your treasure gone! No, you[Pg 63] may live. I have no use for your life, that is, if you don\u0027t wake up. In that case, I may have to kill you.\" The bag of gold-dust lay under the head of Miles. He knew of no better place for it, calculating that any attempt at removal would arouse him. So it might under ordinary circumstances, but unusual fatigue made him sleep like a log. Bill Crane kneeled down, and by delicate manipulation succeeded in drawing the bag from beneath the sleeper\u0027s head. Lest the removal of the pillow might awaken Miles, he replaced it by a coat, which he folded up so as to produce about the same elevation above the ground. The transfer was made, without in the least interfering with the slumbers of the tired traveller. Bill Crane rose to his feet, triumphant. Not only was he possessed of a sum of which he stood sorely in need, but he had the satisfaction of outwitting his adversary. Moreover, he had obtained Tom\u0027s money in addition, and thus revenged himself upon the boy who had once thwarted him.[Pg 64] \"Good-by, John Miles!\" he said, lifting his hat mockingly. \"Sorry to inconvenience you, but can\u0027t help it. A long sleep, and pleasant dreams!\" Thus speaking, he turned away, unconscious that he had been observed by a third party. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81890.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
