{"id":25795,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. MILES SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY.","content":"\"When Miles woke up in the morning he found Tom beside him. \"Hallo, Tom!\" he said, in some surprise. \"This is an early call.\" \"I have been here half the night,\" said Tom, quietly. \"How is that?\" \"I was afraid you would be robbed.\" \"Did you have any particular reason for fearing it?\" asked Miles, quickly. Thereupon Tom described his chance visit of the evening before, and what he saw. As might have been expected, John Miles was indignant. \"The miserable sneak! I\u0027d like to wring his neck,\" he exclaimed. \"Did you say he had his hand upon the bag of gold-dust, Tom?\"[Pg 49]EY. \"Yes; I distinctly saw him attempting to draw it out from under your head.\" \"If the boys knew of this, Crane\u0027s fate would be sealed. A thief in a mining camp has a short shrift.\" \"You mean he would be hung?\" asked Tom, in surprise. \"Yes, he would grace a limb of yonder tree, and I am not sure but it would be the best way to dispose of him.\" Tom shuddered. \"It would be a terrible fate,\" he said. \"I should like to see him punished, but I don\u0027t want him hanged.\" \"Then you will have to keep your mouth shut. Once let the boys get hold of what happened, and nothing will save him.\" \"Then I shall keep it to myself.\" \"I will see Crane, and let him understand that I am aware of the attempt he made,\" said Miles. After breakfast he came upon Crane within a few rods of Missouri Jack\u0027s saloon.[Pg 50] \"Look here, Bill Crane,\" said Miles, \"I\u0027ve got something to say to you.\" \"What is it?\" returned Crane, sullenly, looking ill at ease. \"I understand you favored me with a visit, last night.\" \"Who told you so?\" \"Tom Nelson.\" \"The young cub had better mind his own business,\" growled Crane, in a menacing tone. \"He did me a service in preventing your intended theft.\" \"If he says I meant to rob you, he lies!\" \"Nevertheless, if he should make public what he saw, the boys would be likely to believe him rather than you,\" said Miles, significantly. \"Is he going to tell?\" asked Crane, nervously. \"He has told me, but is not likely to speak of it to others, being unwilling that you should suffer the punishment you deserve.\" \"He is very kind,\" sneered Bill Crane, but he felt very much relieved. \"You probably owe your life to his kindness,\"[Pg 51] said Miles, quietly. \"He tells me you wish me to do something for you in Frisco.\" \"I\u0027ve changed my mind,\" said Crane, abruptly; \"I may go there myself, soon.\" Miles smiled. \"I thought it might be something urgent,\" he said, \"since it led you to come to my tent at midnight.\" \"I thought you would be starting away early this morning.\" \"Well thought of, Bill Crane; but it is only fair to tell you that I don\u0027t believe a word you say. I have one thing to say to you before I go, and you had better bear it in mind. If you harm a hair of Tom Nelson\u0027s head, and I believe you quite capable of it, I will never rest till I have found you out and punished you for it.\" \"I am not afraid of you, John Miles,\" retorted Crane, but he looked uncomfortable. \"You will have cause to be, if you injure Tom.\" Miles walked off, leaving behind him a bitter enemy.[Pg 52] \"I hate him—him and the boy too!\" muttered Bill Crane. \"If I dared, I would put my mark on him before he leaves the camp.\" But Crane did not dare. He knew that he was in a very critical position. His safety depended on the silence of two persons—one of whom would soon be gone. He was not aware that Ferguson also knew of his attempted crime, or the danger would have seemed greater. However much he thirsted for vengeance, it would not do to gratify it now. He must bide his time. Bill Crane was cunning as well as malignant. He decided to quiet Tom\u0027s suspicions if he could, and ensure his continued silence, by an affectation of friendliness. He waited till he saw our hero washing dust beyond earshot of any listeners, and strolled up to him. \"How are you getting on, Tom?\" he asked, with an appearance of friendliness. Tom looked up quickly. Considering all that had happened, he was somewhat struck by Crane\u0027s effrontery. \"Fairly well,\" he answered coldly.[Pg 53] \"Shan\u0027t I relieve you a few minutes?\" proposed Crane. \"No, thank you.\" \"It\u0027s pretty hard work, and don\u0027t pay as well as it might. I think California\u0027s a humbug, for my part.\" \"Have you tried washing for gold?\" asked Tom. \"I haven\u0027t seen you at work.\" \"Not here. I\u0027ve tried it elsewhere, but it\u0027s slow.\" \"Then, why do you stay here?\" asked Tom, naturally. Crane shrugged his shoulders. \"Because I haven\u0027t money to get away,\" he said. \"I\u0027m waiting for something to turn up. If I could only get to Frisco, I would go into some business. I would like to have gone with Miles.\" \"Was that what you were going to propose to him, last night?\" asked Tom, dryly. \"Yes, I wanted to speak to him on that subject. I had a great mind to ask him to lend me a little money, and take me along with him.[Pg 54] I would have arranged to pay him soon after we reached Frisco.\" Tom knew that the fellow was lying, and remained silent. \"You made a little mistake about my intentions,\" continued Bill Crane, smoothly, \"but perhaps it was natural under the circumstances.\" Tom thought it was, but still preserved silence, much to Crane\u0027s discomfiture. Bill Crane eyed him sharply, and saw his incredulity, but for that he cared little, if only he could secure his silence. \"I think you will see that it isn\u0027t fair to me to speak of this matter,\" he continued. \"I had made up my mind not to speak of it,\" said Tom. \"I don\u0027t want to get you into trouble.\" \"Good-morning, Mr. Crane,\" said Lawrence Peabody, who had just come up. \"Good-morning, Peabody. I was watching our friend Tom. How are you getting on?\" \"I haven\u0027t done anything yet to-day. It\u0027s dirty work. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s fit for a gentleman;[Pg 55] Tom, there, is used to work, and he don\u0027t mind.\" \"Shall we go round to Jack\u0027s?\" \"All right!\" And the two walked away together. \"I am sorry Peabody doesn\u0027t keep better company,\" Tom said to himself. \"Bill Crane won\u0027t do him any good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81889.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
