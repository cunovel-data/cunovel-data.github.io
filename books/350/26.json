{"id":25815,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. WHITEFACE.","content":"Mark Nelson missed sorely the cow which he had been compelled to yield to the squire on account of default of interest. Whiteface was his best cow, and a great favorite with all the children. She gave nearly as much milk as the other two, and had been one of the main dependences of the family. It was worth considerably more than the thirty dollars for which the squire took it; but he insisted upon that and no other, and Whiteface had to go. Six months had passed, and there seemed to be very little chance of redeeming the lost cow. Squire Hudson had agreed to give her back on payment of the balance due, with accrued interest; but neither he nor Mark Nelson expected that such an offer would be made. \"I was passing Squire Hudson\u0027s to-day, and saw[Pg 235] poor Whiteface,\" said Walter, one evening. \"I think she knew me, for when I called her she lowed back.\" \"I wish we had her back,\" said Sarah. \"It was heartless in the squire to take her. He had a dozen cows of his own.\" \"He hasn\u0027t any heart,\" said Walter, \"or, if he has, it must be pretty small.\" \"We must not forget that he was entitled to some security for the balance of interest I owe him,\" said the farmer. \"The cow was worth a good deal more than thirty dollars,\" said Sarah. \"Yes, she was; but I am not sure whether I could have got any more money for her at a forced sale. Then you know the squire is pledged to give her back whenever I can pay him the thirty dollars, with interest.\" \"I wish you could pay it now, father,\" said Walter. \"So do I, my boy; but I cannot, unless your brother sends me some money.\" \"It is three weeks since we have heard from[Pg 236] Tom,\" said Mrs. Nelson, anxiously. \"I am afraid he is sick.\" \"Don\u0027t worry yourself with imaginary fears, Mary,\" said her husband. \"Tom may be sick, of course; but he is strong and healthy, and we won\u0027t fear such a thing without some ground. Probably a letter is on the way from him now.\" \"I hope he is making money,\" said Walter. \"I wish I were with him.\" \"I would never consent to have you go too,\" said Mrs. Nelson, hastily. \"I don\u0027t think Walter seriously thinks of asking leave,\" said Mr. Nelson, smiling. \"As he is only thirteen years old, I should be inclined to object myself. I must have him at home to help me with the farm.\" \"I should be perfectly contented to stay at home if we had Whiteface back,\" said Walter. \"I\u0027ve a great mind to steal her out of the squire\u0027s yard. I bet she\u0027d be glad to come.\" \"Don\u0027t speak in that way, Walter,\" said his father. \"I dislike to have you speak of stealing, even in fun.\"[Pg 237] At this moment there was a knock at the front door. Farmer Nelson\u0027s house was an old-fashioned one, and not provided with a bell. \"Go to the door, Sarah,\" said her father. Sarah obeyed. \"Good-evening, Nahum,\" she said to the village expressman. \"I\u0027ve got a small package for your folks,\" said Nahum. \"It\u0027s marked all over. Guess it came from Californy.\" \"It must be from Tom,\" exclaimed Sarah, in delight. \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" said the expressman, who knew everybody in the village, and could probably give a fairly correct list of their sisters, cousins, and aunts, with a fair guess at their worldly circumstances. \"Is there anything to pay, Nahum?\" \"Only fifty cents,—the expressage from Boston. Never mind about it now, for I\u0027m in a hurry. Your father can hand it to me next time he sees me.\" \"O father, here\u0027s a package from Tom,\" said[Pg 238] Sarah, hurrying into the room where they were all sitting. \"Open it quick,\" said Walter. \"See if there\u0027s any money in it.\" The cord was cut, and a small box was disclosed containing a hundred dollars in gold pieces and a line from Tom, stating that he was doing well, and that he hoped soon to send some more money. \"A hundred dollars! What a lot of money!\" exclaimed Walter, gazing on the little pile of coins as if fascinated. \"I am so glad the dear boy is doing well,\" said Mrs. Nelson. \"Now we can have Whiteface back, can\u0027t we, father?\" asked Walter, joyfully. \"Yes, Walter,\" said Mark Nelson, almost as excited as his son. \"I will go over the first thing in the morning.\" \"Can\u0027t we go over this evening?\" asked Walter, impatiently. \"No, it is dark, and Whiteface is stalled for the night.\"[Pg 239] \"You\u0027ll have seventy dollars left over, father, won\u0027t you?\" \"Yes; and that will provide for my next interest. I feel grateful and happy at Tom\u0027s success and his thoughtfulness.\" Could Tom have seen the effect of his remittance it would have made his heart glad, and he would have felt abundantly repaid for his labor and self-denial. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81909.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
