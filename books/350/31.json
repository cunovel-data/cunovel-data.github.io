{"id":25820,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE AUCTION.","content":"It was a sad household, that of Mark Nelson, on the day preceding the departure from the farm. There was to be an auction the next day, at which the farm-stock and farm-implements were to be sold. It was well understood that Squire Hudson was to be the buyer of the farm, and as he was not likely to have any competitor there was little hope that it would fetch more than the amount of the mortgage. During the afternoon Mr. Nelson called on Squire Hudson to make the best terms he could at private sale. \"The farm is worth at least a thousand dollars more than the mortgage, Squire Hudson,\" said the farmer. \"It is worth what it will fetch, Mr. Nelson,\" said the squire.[Pg 272] \"Do you mean that an article always commands its full value at auction, Squire Hudson?\" \"Ahem! it brings its market value, Mr. Nelson.\" \"Which may be far below its intrinsic value. Suppose a diamond worth ten thousand dollars were put up at auction in our village, do you consider that it would bring a fair price?\" \"Ahem! you are wandering from the subject. We are talking of farms, not diamonds.\" \"As to the farm, then, you are likely to be the only bidder, unless you allow the mortgage to remain.\" \"If I were inclined to do that I would not disturb you as long as you paid the interest promptly.\" \"Then you decline to buy the farm at private sale?\" \"I do.\" \"I don\u0027t think you will be any better off in the end, Squire Hudson, for oppressing a poor man, and robbing him of his little all,\" said Mark Nelson, bitterly.[Pg 273] \"You don\u0027t look at the matter from a business point of view,\" said the squire, coldly. \"I am acting as any business man would under the circumstances.\" \"I cannot believe you, sir. All business men are not so hard-hearted.\" \"I really don\u0027t think there is any use in prolonging this interview,\" said Squire Hudson, stiffly. \"I have resolved upon my course, in which I am perfectly justified, however you may choose to regard it.\" This removed the farmer\u0027s last hope, and he had only to look about for another home for his family. There was small choice of houses in the little farming town. In fact there was but one house,—a shabby, dilapidated building, a mile from the church and store. This, Mr. Nelson, having no choice, engaged for a period of three months. \"It makes me homesick to think of going to live in that barn,\" said Sarah, as they were sitting together after supper. \"It may not be so bad as you think for,[Pg 274] Sarah,\" said her mother; but she secretly sympathized with her daughter. \"I wish Squire Hudson had to live there himself,\" said Walter, in an angry outburst. Usually Walter was checked by his father when uttering such speeches; but to-night Mark Nelson took no notice of his son\u0027s angry remark. He felt that it would only be a righteous retribution upon the squire for his cold selfishness. While they were sitting in the plain room endeared to them by the association of years, a sound of wheels was heard, and the village stage stopped before the door. \"Who can it be?\" said Sarah, wonderingly. The whole family hurried to the window. What youthful, yet manly figure, was that actively descending from his perch beside the driver? \"It\u0027s Tom!\" exclaimed Mrs. Nelson. \"Heaven be praised! It is my dear boy.\" Tom was almost suffocated by the embraces which he received on entering the house. \"How you have grown, Tom!\" said Sarah. \"And how well you look!\"[Pg 275] \"Thank you for the compliment,\" said Tom, laughing. \"But I don\u0027t feel well.\" \"What is the matter?\" asked his mother, with maternal solicitude. \"I am as hungry as a bear. Have you got anything to eat in the house?\" This hint was enough. Fresh tea was made, and the wanderer was soon sitting before a bountiful supply of food, cooked in his mother\u0027s best style. \"It seems good to be at home,\" said Tom, looking around him, his face beaming with happiness. \"Did you get my letter, Tom, announcing the squire\u0027s intention to foreclose the mortgage?\" asked his father, gravely. \"Yes, father; is it really true?\" \"Yes; he will listen to no persuasions.\" \"When does the sale take place?\" \"To-morrow.\" \"I shall be present. Have you thought of any other house, father?\" \"The old Belcher house is the only one I can hire.\"[Pg 276] \"That is a poor place.\" \"It must do for lack of a better.\" \"I didn\u0027t think the squire would act so meanly. At any rate, father, I will see that you don\u0027t any of you suffer for lack of money.\" \"Have you been doing well, Tom?\" asked Walter. \"Ask me to-morrow, Walter. To-night I want to hear all the news, and everything that has happened since I went away.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81914.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
