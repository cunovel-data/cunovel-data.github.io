{"id":25800,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. A CALIFORNIA WIDOW.","content":"John Miles eyed the woman curiously. There did not seem much that was feminine left in her. Life in the wilderness had made her as bold and self-reliant as a man. She was not compelled to plead for woman\u0027s rights. She resolutely took a man\u0027s rights, and was prepared to maintain them against all comers. \"I rather think you can take care of yourself, ma\u0027am,\" he said. \"You can bet your bottom dollar on that, stranger,\" said the woman, cheerfully. \"Brown—that\u0027s my husband—knew what I was. We was ekal partners—Brown and me—and he knew too much to tread on me.\" \"I\u0027m glad I wasn\u0027t Brown,\" thought John Miles. \"When I marry, it\u0027ll be a woman, and not a man in petticoats.\"[Pg 94] \"If you\u0027re hungry, stranger,\" said the woman, \"just jump off that horse of yours, and come in. I can give you a square meal, and I reckon you haven\u0027t had one lately.\" \"You are right, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles, dismounting with alacrity. \"My provisions are dry and stale, and I shall enjoy a square meal amazingly. But I ought to tell you that last night I was robbed of a bag of gold-dust, and I have nothing to pay you.\" \"Who asks for pay?\" returned the woman. \"I don\u0027t keep a hotel, but I\u0027m tired of eating alone. I want to see how it seems to have a man setting opposite me agin. So come in, and I won\u0027t keep you waiting long.\" \"Thank you, Mrs. Brown. If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027ll light my pipe, and sit out here till I\u0027ve had a smoke.\" \"You can smoke inside if you want to. I always let Brown. It makes me feel better, now that he\u0027s pegged out, that I didn\u0027t deny him any of his little comforts.\" \"Clearly Mrs. Brown was a cons[Pg 95]iderate wife,\" thought Miles; \"but she doesn\u0027t look like a woman to fall in love with.\" Tying his horse, he threw himself down on the grass, and enjoyed the luxury of a smoke while Mrs. Brown was heard bustling about inside, preparing the square meal which she had promised to her unexpected guest. Presently she reappeared. \"The victuals is ready, if you are, stranger,\" she said. \"I am ready, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles, rising at once, and entering the cabin. The cabin was rough, and ill-adapted to a fastidious tenant, but it looked comfortable. What attracted Miles most, however, was a table set in the middle of the floor, covered with a substantial and appetizing meal. Mrs. Brown was a fair cook—perhaps her only feminine accomplishment. She placed Miles at the head of the table, and seated herself opposite him. She watched his attacks upon the fare she had provided with evident satisfaction. \"I hope you like it,\" she said.[Pg 96] \"Mrs. Brown, I haven\u0027t tasted anything so good for a long time.\" She nodded, with a pleased look. \"Brown allus liked my cookin,\" she said. \"He had a good appetite most generally, and it was a pleasure to see him eat. It\u0027s kinder lonesome cookin\u0027 for yourself. Then, too, it takes away my appetite sittin\u0027 down alone to eat.\" \"You must be very lonely, Mrs. Brown.\" \"Yes, its lonesome like bein\u0027 a widder. I\u0027m kinder used to seein\u0027 a man about the house.\" \"So I suppose.\" \"Be you a married man?\" asked the lady, pointedly. \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"How old be you?\" \"Twenty-eight,\" answered Miles, rather amused. \"Then you\u0027re old enough to get married?\" \"Oh yes, I am old enough.\" \"Be you in love with any girl?\" \"The old woman\u0027s getting curious,\" thought Miles. \"However, I don\u0027t mind gratifying her curiosity.\"[Pg 97] \"No, I\u0027m not in love,\" he replied. Mrs. Brown eyed him thoughtfully. She seemed to be revolving some plan in her mind. \"Take a good look at me, stranger,\" she said, bracing herself up, as if on exhibition. \"Certainly,\" said John Miles, considerably astonished. \"I want to ask you a few questions.\" \"Go ahead, Mrs. Brown.\" \"Am I hump-backed?\" \"Certainly not. Who said you were?\" \"Just attend to my questions, if you please, stranger. Am I squint-eyed?\" \"Mrs. Brown must be crazy,\" thought Miles. However, he answered in the negative. \"Am I as homely as a hedge-fence?\" pursued the widow. \"Has anybody been calling you so? If so, tell me who it is.\" \"Never you mind, stranger. Am I old and wrinkled?\" \"Certainly she\u0027s out of her mind,\" thought Miles. \"I must humor her.\"[Pg 98] \"I think you are a very good-looking woman,\" he said, soothingly. \"No, I\u0027m not,\" said the strong-minded lady, \"but at the same time I ain\u0027t a scarecrow.\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Don\u0027t talk too much, stranger. I expect you\u0027re surprised at my questions, but I\u0027ll come to the p\u0027int at once. I\u0027m tired of livin\u0027 here alone. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d miss Brown so much. He wasn\u0027t any great shakes of a man, but he was better than nothing. He was company for me, Brown was, in the long evenin\u0027s, and I miss him. I\u0027ve made up my mind to take on somebody in his place, and I reckon I\u0027d like to engage you, stranger. Will you marry me?\" Mrs. Brown did not blush when she asked this extraordinary question. She was entirely self-possessed, and could not have been cooler, if she had been transacting an ordinary piece of business. John Miles had never before received a proposal of marriage. He felt as awkward and confused as a young girl, and began to hesitate and stammer.[Pg 99] \"Really, Mrs. Brown,\" he began, \"you have taken me by surprise.\" \"I expect I have,\" said the widow, \"but I\u0027ll give you time to think it over. Brown left me I pretty comfortable, though I did more to get the property together than he. You wouldn\u0027t think it, perhaps, but I\u0027ve got five thousand dollars in gold hid away somewheres near, and there\u0027s a claim not far away, that belongs to me, and will pay for workin\u0027.\" \"I am glad you are so well off, Mrs. Brown,\" said Miles. \"If you marry me,\" continued the widow, \"you can work that claim. You\u0027re a strong, able-bodied man, and a year from now, if you want to, we\u0027ll go to the city, and settle down. I\u0027m older than you; but a matter of a few years don\u0027t make much difference. You were robbed, you told me?\" \"Yes, of all that I had.\" \"How much was it?\" \"About two hundred dollars.\" \"That ain\u0027t much.\" [Pg 100] \"It\u0027s a good deal when it\u0027s all you have,\" answered Miles. \"If you marry me you won\u0027t miss it,\" said Mrs. Brown. \"I won\u0027t give you my money right off, for you might run off with it, but at the end of the first year you shall have half of it. There\u0027s a parson a few miles up the ca?on, at Dirt Hole, that will marry us any time we ride over. What do you say, stranger?\" It was an embarrassing moment for John Miles. He had no desire to succeed the deceased Brown, notwithstanding the little property he had left behind him. Mrs. Brown did not in the least resemble the wife of whom he had sometimes dreamed. But how could he decline without exciting the resentment of that singular female? He bore in mind that Mrs. Brown carried a revolver, and she might take a notion to shoot him down. He must temporize. \"Your proposal is a very kind and flattering one, Mrs. Brown, but I don\u0027t care to marry just at present. I want to go to the city and try my fortune. I\u0027ve only lately arrived in California,[Pg 101] and I am not ready to settle down yet.\" To his relief Mrs. Brown accepted his objection in good part. \"No offence, stranger,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t know how you might feel about it. I\u0027ve made you a fair offer.\" \"Indeed you have. The time may come when I shall return, and—\" \"I won\u0027t promise to wait for you, stranger. Somebody else may happen along that\u0027ll take the situation.\" \"It would be too much to expect you to wait for me, I admit.\" \"All right, stranger. You\u0027ve answered fair, and now we\u0027ll let the matter drop.\" When Miles left the cabin he carried with him an addition to his stock of provisions, for which he was indebted to Mrs. Brown\u0027s liberality. It was evident that she bore no malice, notwithstanding her suit had been rejected. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81894.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
