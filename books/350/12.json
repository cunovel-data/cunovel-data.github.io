{"id":25801,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI. BILL CRANE\u0027S GOOD LUCK.","content":"About an hour after John Miles rode away from the widow\u0027s door Mr. William Crane came in sight of the cabin. He had strayed from the direct course, and that had delayed him. Otherwise he would not have fallen behind Miles. Bill Crane was in rather a melancholy mood. He had not got over his disappointment of the morning. He was fagged out and hungry, and felt that luck was against him. When he saw the cabin, and the widow Brown sitting in the door-way, it instantly occurred to him that here was a chance to get a dinner. He had nothing to pay, to be sure, but he need say nothing about it till after the dinner was eaten. As he rode up, he removed his hat, and said, \"Good-day, ma\u0027am.\" Mrs. Brown scrutinized the new-comer with[Pg 103] critical eyes. She decided that he was not as good-looking as John Miles. Indeed Bill Crane never could have been accounted handsome; but on this point the widow was not exacting. She was looking for somebody to fill the place of her lamented Brown, and relieve her loneliness, and it was Crane\u0027s eligibility in this respect that she was considering. Beauty was but skin deep, as Mrs. Brown was practical enough to admit, and she was not overstocked with that attractive quality herself. Though Crane did not know it, the resolute, middle-aged female, from whom he hoped to obtain a gratuitous dinner, was making up her mind to offer him the position of husband. \"Good-day, stranger,\" she answered composedly. \"Are you travelin\u0027 fur?\" \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 of goin\u0027 to Frisco,\" he said, \"but it\u0027s a long journey and I\u0027m fagged out. If you have no objection, I\u0027ll stop at your place and see if I can rest a few minutes.\" \"You can stop if you want to,\" she said.[Pg 104] \"I don\u0027t see much company, and I like to see a new face now and then.\" \"So do I,\" said Crane, thinking a little flattery might help him; \"especially when it\u0027s the face of a good-looking woman.\" \"I ain\u0027t good-lookin\u0027 enough to hurt me,\" returned Mrs. Brown, with a frankness which rather disconcerted and puzzled Crane, \"but I don\u0027t mind you callin\u0027 me so. If you are anyways hungry, I haven\u0027t cleared away the dinner, and—\" \"You are very kind,\" broke in Crane, eagerly; \"I don\u0027t mind saying I am a little bit hungry.\" \"All right, stranger. If you\u0027ll wait long enough for me to make some hot tea, and warm the victuals, you shall have a chance to judge of my cookin\u0027.\" Bill Crane was quite elated. He decided that the widow would not ask him for payment, thus saving him from embarrassing excuses. In due time he was called in and seated in the chair not long since occupied by John Miles.[Pg 105] \"You\u0027re the second man that\u0027s dined with me to-day,\" said the widow. \"And who was the first lucky man?\" inquired Crane, suspecting at once that it might have been Miles. \"I don\u0027t know his name, but he was a good-looking young man, who said he had had a bag of gold-dust stolen from him.\" \"That\u0027s Miles,\" thought Crane; and he at once decided not to betray any knowledge of him. \"He was in bad luck,\" said Bill. \"Did he know who stole it?\" \"He didn\u0027t tell me. I don\u0027t think he knew.\" \"That\u0027s well,\" thought Crane. \"Did he say where he was going?\" \"To the city.\" \"Do you live here all the year round, Mrs.——?\" \"My name\u0027s Brown, stranger.\" \"All I can say is, that Brown is a lucky man. Another cup of tea if you please, Mrs. Brown.\" \"You might not like to exchange places with[Pg 106] him, for all his luck, stranger,\" remarked the widow. \"Indeed I would,\" said Bill, with a languishing look. \"He\u0027s six feet under ground!\" explained Mrs. Brown, dryly. \"Dead?\" ejaculated Crane. \"Yes; he\u0027s been dead these three weeks.\" \"And you are a widow?\" \"That\u0027s so, stranger.\" \"But you don\u0027t mean to stay a widow?\" interrogated Crane. \"Well, it is kinder lonesome. It seems natural like to have a man round.\" \"I wonder if she\u0027s got any money,\" thought Crane. \"I\u0027ll find out if I can.\" \"Yes, Mrs. Brown, I feel for you,\" he said. \"A woman can\u0027t struggle with the world as a man can.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that, stranger. I can take care of myself, if that\u0027s what you mean.\" \"But a woman needs a man to protect and work for her,\" insinuated Crane.[Pg 107] \"I don\u0027t need any one to protect me,\" said the widow; \"and, as for support, I\u0027ve got a matter of five thousand dollars laid by, and a good claim that\u0027ll pay for the workin\u0027. I don\u0027t think I shall need to go to the poor-house yet awhile.\" Bill Crane\u0027s eyes sparkled. The widow Brown seemed wonderfully attractive in his eyes. He was willing to barter his young affections for five thousand dollars and a claim, even if the widow had been thrice as homely as she was. If he had known that Mrs. Brown was bent on marriage his way would have been clearer. His mind was made up. He would woo and win his fair hostess if he could. \"When did Brown die?\" he inquired. \"Three weeks ago, stranger.\" \"You must miss him.\" \"Yes, he was a quiet man, Brown was. He never gave me any trouble, and it was natural to see him round.\" \"You must not mourn for him too much, Mrs. Brown.\" \"I shan\u0027t make a fool of myself,\" said the[Pg 108] widow. \"He\u0027s gone, and he won\u0027t come back. There\u0027s no use cryin\u0027.\" \"She\u0027s rather a queer specimen,\" thought Crane. \"She hasn\u0027t broken her heart, it seems.\" \"You ought to marry again,\" he said. \"I mean to,\" said Mrs. Brown. \"Well, that\u0027s frank,\" thought Crane. \"There ain\u0027t any nonsense about her.\" \"Your second husband will be a lucky man, Mrs. Brown.\" \"Well, he\u0027ll have a good livin\u0027, and, if he treats me right, he\u0027ll get treated right too.\" \"This is a cold world, Mrs. Brown. I\u0027ve been drifting about till I\u0027m tired. I\u0027d like to settle down with a good wife.\" \"If you want to take Brown\u0027s place, say so,\" remarked the widow, in a business-like tone. Bill Crane was staggered by the promptness with which his hint was taken, but did not hesitate to follow it up. \"That\u0027s what I mean,\" he said. \"What\u0027s your name, stranger?\" \"William Crane.\"[Pg 109] \"You haven\u0027t got another wife anywhere, have you?\" \"Of course not.\" \"I\u0027ve got to take your word for it, I s\u0027pose. I guess I\u0027ll take the risk. I\u0027ll marry you if you say so.\" \"How soon?\" asked Crane, eagerly. \"Well, there\u0027s a parson a few miles from here. We can ride right over and be back by sundown, if that will suit you.\" \"A capital idea, Mrs. Brown. You won\u0027t be Brown long,\" he added, sportively. \"How will you like to be called Mrs. Crane?\" \"One name will do as well as another,\" said the widow, philosophically. Crane wanted to make inquiries about the five thousand dollars and the claim; but he reflected that it might be inferred that his views were mercenary. It would be more politic to wait till after marriage. He did not understand the character of the woman he was going to marry. She understood very well that Crane was marrying her for her money; but she felt lonesome, and it[Pg 110] suited her to have a husband, and she was willing to overlook such a trifle. The widow had a horse of her own. Directly after dinner it was harnessed, and the two rode over to Dirt Hole, a small mining settlement, where the Rev. Pelatiah Pond, a Methodist minister, united them in the bonds of matrimony. When Mr. and Mrs. Crane reached home, Bill ventured to inquire, \"Have you got the money in the house, Mrs. Crane,—the five thousand dollars, I mean?\" \"It\u0027s put away in a safe place.\" \"You\u0027d better let me take care of it for you, my dear.\" \"Not at present, Mr. Crane. A year from now I will let you have half of it, if you behave yourself.\" \"As your husband, madam, I insist.\" \"Stop right there, stranger—Mr. Crane, I mean,\" said the bride, decidedly. \"Do you see that? and she whipped out a revolver. \"Good gracious, Mrs. Crane! Do you want to murder me?\"[Pg 111] \"No, I didn\u0027t marry you for that; but I want you to understand that the money is in my hands, and I don\u0027t allow any man to insist. I may let you have some of it when I get ready. Do you understand?\" \"I believe I do,\" murmured Crane. \"I\u0027m regularly taken in and done for,\" he reflected sadly. But directly after their return Mrs. Crane prepared a nice supper, and Crane, as he ate it, and smoked a pipe later, began to be reconciled to his new situation. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81895.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
