{"id":25816,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. SQUIRE HUDSON\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT.","content":"If Whiteface was missed at her old home, she was scarcely less appreciated by her new possessor. On the very morning succeeding the day when Tom\u0027s remittance was received the squire remarked to his head workman, \"Whiteface is an excellent cow, Abner.\" \"Yes, squire, I calculate she\u0027s the best you\u0027ve got.\" \"I don\u0027t know but she is, Abner,\" said the squire, complacently. \"I consider her worth at least fifty dollars.\" \"So she is, every cent of it.\" \"And she cost me only thirty,\" thought Squire Hudson, with a smile of content. He was a rich man, and abundantly able to pay his poor neighbor the full value of the cow; but somehow it never occurred to him to do it. He[Pg 241] was not above taking an unfair advantage of a man who was unluckily in his power. Of course the squire knew that Farmer Nelson had a right to redeem the cow at the price agreed upon with interest; but he felt pretty safe on this point. The farmer was not very likely to have thirty dollars to spare, and as for a remittance from Tom the squire was pretty sure none would be received. \"It\u0027ll be all the boy can do to take care of himself out there,\" he reflected, \"let alone sending money home. He may send ten dollars or so some time; but it\u0027s very doubtful, very doubtful!\" Squire Hudson turned to go back to the house when he saw the man of whom he had been thinking coming up the road. He stopped short, thinking the farmer might wish to speak to him. \"Good-morning, Mr. Nelson,\" he said, pleasantly, for he was in good-humor. \"Good-morning, squire.\" \"Your Whiteface has got to feel quite at home in my barn-yard.\" \"She is a good cow, Squire Hudson.\"[Pg 242] \"Yes, tolerable, tolerable.\" \"She is worth more than the thirty dollars for which you took her.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know about that. Cows are pretty cheap nowadays.\" \"I see how it is,\" thought the squire. \"Nelson wants me to allow him more for the cow; but a bargain is a bargain, and I shan\u0027t do it.\" \"I always valued her at a considerably higher price.\" \"No doubt, no doubt. You raised her yourself, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"That makes a difference, of course. You attach a sentimental value to her; but that doesn\u0027t affect her real value. I really can\u0027t allow you any more for her.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to, Squire Hudson.\" The squire looked astonished. \"What is the man driving at?\" he thought. \"She may not be worth any more to you, and so you won\u0027t mind my taking her back.\" \"Taking her back!\" ejaculated the squire.[Pg 243] \"Certainly; it was agreed that I could redeem her at any time, by paying you the thirty dollars and interest.\" \"Not after two months,\" said the squire, hastily. \"It is not two months. It was only six weeks yesterday. The fact is, squire, I\u0027ve come for Whiteface, and I\u0027ve got the money for you.\" \"Have you heard from Tom?\" asked the squire, with a blank look of disappointment. \"Yes; I heard from him yesterday.\" \"And he sent you some money?\" \"Yes; he reports that he is doing well.\" \"Did he send you thirty dollars?\" \"Rather more than that,\" said Mark Nelson, not caring to gratify the curiosity of his creditor. \"I think you had better keep your money, and leave Whiteface with me,\" said Squire Hudson, after a pause. \"I would rather not, squire. The fact is, Whiteface is a sort of pet at home, and we all want her back.\" Squire Hudson was disconcerted. He had not expected that Mr. Nelson would be able to redeem[Pg 244] the cow, and he was reluctant to give her up. But there was no excuse for retaining her. His agreement stood in the way. \"Neighbor Nelson,\" he said, after a pause, \"I don\u0027t mind giving you five dollars over and above what you owe me for Whiteface. Come, that\u0027s a good offer.\" Mark Nelson shook his head. \"She\u0027s worth more than that,\" he said. \"But that\u0027s neither here nor there. I raised the animal, and it was sorely against my will that I parted with her six weeks ago. Now that I have the money to pay you I want her back.\" \"I think you are standing in your own light, Mr. Nelson,\" said the squire. \"I have taken a fancy to the cow, and am willing to pay more for her than she is worth. I will say ten dollars.\" Mark Nelson shook his head. \"I\u0027d rather have Whiteface than the money,\" he said. \"If she comes into my possession again,\" said Squire Hudson, \"I shall not be willing to grant you the privilege of redeeming her. It won\u0027t be[Pg 245] many months before another payment becomes due.\" \"I hope to be ready to meet it, squire,\" said the farmer, not appearing at all anxious. \"He seems very independent,\" thought the squire, watching, moodily, the cow driven away by her former owner. \"He may sing another tune on interest day. I wonder how much the boy sent home.\" Had he known that Mr. Nelson had in his pocket enough money to pay the whole of the next accruing interest, he would have felt more doubtful about recovering the cow which he now coveted more than ever. \"Well, Abner, I\u0027ve lost her,\" said the squire, hurrying to his assistant; \"but she\u0027ll be back here some day, mark my words!\" \"I thought you bought her, squire,\" said Abner, in surprise. \"Well, not exactly. I took her for a debt; but Nelson had the right of redeeming her, and he has done it. His boy sent him the money.\" \"That Tom Nelson is a smart boy,\" said Abner,[Pg 246] who, though in the squire\u0027s employ, was friendly to our hero. \"Well, so-so,\" remarked the squire, indifferently. \"I helped him to go to California; but I am not sure whether it was a wise step. I let my feelings get the better of my judgment.\" \"Then it is the first time,\" was Abner\u0027s unspoken comment. \"It may turn out for the best,\" he said aloud. \"I doubt if I shall ever see my money again,\" said the squire; but he did not seem to take it to heart, judging from his manner and tone. \"Didn\u0027t you have security for the loan?\" asked Abner. \"Well, ye-es,\" answered the squire, slowly; \"but not very good. The farm was already mortgaged for its full value.\" \"The squire is getting benevolent,\" thought Abner, \"or he wants me to think so; but I\u0027m inclined to think he has some object under it all. What is it?\" A few weeks later Farmer Nelson\u0027s heart was gladdened by the receipt of another remittance[Pg 247] this time sent by John Miles, out of the profit of the business in which Tom was his partner. The amount this time was seventy-five dollars. It made him feel quite rich. \"Mary,\" he said, \"we all need some new clothes, and I propose to use this money for that purpose. Now I want you to consider how we can spend it to the best advantage. To begin with, you must buy a new dress. You have long needed one.\" Mrs. Nelson demurred a little, but was forced to admit that the dress was needed. So the purchases were made at once. It is wonderful how far seventy-five dollars will go in an economical family of plain tastes. It was soon apparent to the neighbors that the Nelsons were exhibiting signs of prosperity. \"It must be Tom,\" they decided. Efforts were made to ascertain just how much our hero had sent home; but on this point the Nelsons would not speak definitely. They reported in general terms that Tom was doing well. Of course Squire Hudson was not ignorant of[Pg 248] the apparent improvement in the fortunes of his debtor. Strange to say, he seemed rather annoyed. He was pleased, however, by the outlay for dress. \"They\u0027re getting extravagant, Abner,\" he said, cheerfully. \"I thought Mark Nelson was a man of more sense. Because his son has sent home a little money, he must rig out the whole family in new clothes. \u0027A fool and his money are soon parted.\u0027\" \"Mark Nelson is no fool,\" said Abner, stoutly. \"He is in this instance,\" said the squire, sharply. \"However, I don\u0027t object to it, if he likes to violate the rules of prudence. It strikes me, however, that it would be well for him to pay up the money I advanced for Tom\u0027s expenses, before buying new clothes wholesale.\" Abner repeated this to Mr. Nelson. The farmer answered quietly, \"The squire is not wholly wrong. It is good doctrine to pay your debts before you spend money for what you don\u0027t need. In this case, however, we did need the clothes we bought. Now that we are provided, I hope, before very long, if Tom is prospered,[Pg 249] to pay back the two hundred dollars the squire advanced for him.\" \"I hope you will, I\u0027m sure,\" said Abner. \"That\u0027s a smart boy of yours, and I always said so.\" \"He is a good boy, and I am sure he will do what is right.\" \"He\u0027s a blamed sight better than the squire\u0027s boy. Sinclair is a stuck-up jackanapes, and it would do me good to kick him.\" \"It might not do him any good.\" \"I am not sure about that; I think he needs it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81910.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
