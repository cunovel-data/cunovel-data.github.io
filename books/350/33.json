{"id":25822,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. MANHOOD.","content":"If Squire Hudson was surprised at Tom\u0027s suddenly revealed wealth, Mr. Nelson was no less so. When Tom first commenced bidding his father feared that he was only trying to annoy the squire, or, perhaps, seeking to force him to pay a higher price for the farm. But when investigation revealed the fact of Tom\u0027s riches, and he saw the mountain of debt lifted from his little property, he was overjoyed and grateful. \"I can\u0027t understand it, Tom,\" he said; \"how could you possibly get possession of so much money?\" \"I have worked hard, father; but that won\u0027t explain it. I have been very lucky, and my good luck has enabled me to save the farm.\" \"I think you will be easier with me than the squire, Tom,\" said his father, smiling. \"I will[Pg 285] make out a mortgage to you, since your money has been used to redeem the farm.\" \"I shall have no claim on the farm,\" said Tom, \"or if I have I give it to you. I have money enough for myself, and hope to earn a good deal more besides.\" \"If that is the case, Tom, I will gladly accept your gift. It will be a great relief to think that I have no interest to pay. Now I shall be able to get along easily. I have over two hundred dollars on hand.\" \"I want to make your life easier, hereafter, father. I think you need a larger income than the farm will yield you, and I will therefore send you a hundred dollars every quarter.\" \"You are very generous, Tom; but I fear you will soon get rid of all your money at this rate.\" \"I will explain my circumstances, father, and then you will think differently. I have a business in San Francisco which will yield me at least a thousand dollars a year, without my personal attention, and after paying the squire what[Pg 286] is due him I shall have about four thousand dollars left. This I mean to invest securely in Boston.\" \"I can hardly realize that you are so rich, Tom.\" \"I can scarcely realize it myself, father. When I think of the change that fifteen months have made in my circumstances I consider myself the luckiest boy in the world, and have great cause for gratitude.\" It will be understood that, though Tom had bid thirty-five hundred dollars for the farm, all he was required to pay was the amount of the mortgage, the bid having been made in his father\u0027s interest. In a few days the business was completed, and Mr. Nelson found himself the owner of an unencumbered property. Tom remained a week longer in the village, and then started once more for California. His mother urged him to remain at home, now that he had so much money; but Tom reminded her that he was partner in a business in San Francisco, and that he needed to look after his interests[Pg 287] there. John Miles might be sick, or die, and in that case he might meet with serious losses. Returning to San Francisco Tom became an active instead of a silent partner. The business was considerably enlarged, and became much more profitable. At the end of two years Tom sold out to his partner for several thousand dollars, and, entering an office, studied law, devoting a portion of his time to general study. At a comparatively early age he was admitted to the bar of his adopted city, and by degrees got into lucrative practice. He had become so much attached to California that he decided to make it his permanent home. Up among the New Hampshire hills his father still tills his little farm, but he no longer depends upon it for his entire living. Tom regularly sends the allowance he promised, and in addition his brothers are often the recipients of handsome gifts. Harry, developing a taste for study, was sent to Exeter Academy, from which in due course he was transferred to Harvard. He, too, was destined for the law, and when he had taken[Pg 288] his legal degree joined Tom in California, and is now his partner. Other changes there are in the little village. Squire Hudson is dead, and Sinclair, making haste to sell the homestead, removed to New York, engaged in speculation, and lost everything. One day, shabbily dressed, he entered Tom\u0027s office in San Francisco, and asked for the loan of fifty dollars to enable him to reach the mines. Tom gave it, for old acquaintance\u0027 sake. It was not the last request for money made by Sinclair. Nothing has been heard of him for some years, and it is probable that a life which was of no service to any one is finished. He had the best start in life, but misused his advantages. Tom has worthily employed the talents committed to his charge, and is happy, honored, and prosperous.
