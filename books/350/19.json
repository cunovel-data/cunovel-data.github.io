{"id":25808,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. TOM\u0027S OLD HOME.","content":"Leaving Tom for a time, we will cross the continent, and, a little earlier in point of time, look in upon Mark Nelson and his family at their humble home in New Hampshire. For years Mr. Nelson had been struggling to provide a comfortable living for his wife and children. The struggle was not an easy one. His small farm was sterile, and yielded grudgingly its annual crops. Then the mortgage held by Squire Hudson imposed a burden of interest very hard to meet. Each half year sixty-six dollars must be raised somehow to satisfy the squire\u0027s demand. Though a rich man, with ready money in plenty, he never failed to call for his money on the very day it was due. Once or twice he had granted a delay of a day or two; but his manner was so unpleasant that the[Pg 169] farmer, except from dire necessity, was hardly likely to ask a renewal of the favor. The six months immediately following Tom\u0027s departure from home were not favorable to his father. There was a drought of considerable duration, which made the crops smaller than usual, and thus materially decreased the farmer\u0027s income. When the semi-annual interest became due, with the most energetic effort Mark Nelson had got together but thirty-six dollars towards it, leaving a deficit of thirty dollars. \"I feel anxious about to-morrow, Mary,\" he said, as the little family sat together the night before in the plain sitting-room. \"I have never been so much behindhand before with the interest.\" \"How much do you lack, Mark?\" asked Mrs. Nelson. \"Thirty dollars.\" \"That is a good deal of money,\" said his wife, gravely. \"Yes; I don\u0027t know where to raise it. If Squire Hudson were only a little considerate. But he isn\u0027t, and, even if he were, I am afraid[Pg 170] there is no prospect of my raising the money at present.\" \"You may get some money from Tom soon,\" suggested Sarah. \"I can\u0027t rely upon that. Tom will doubtless send when he is able, for he understands my circumstances, and is a thoughtful boy; but it is going to take time for him to earn a surplus—enough to send on.\" \"He may find a big nugget,\" said Walter, the second boy, who eagerly read the letters from California which from time to time appeared in the weekly paper. \"He may, but the chances are against it.\" \"I was reading in last week\u0027s paper about a man finding a nugget worth over two thousand dollars.\" \"Such nuggets are as rare as large prizes in a lottery, I suspect,\" said Mark Nelson, who had a large share of plain common-sense. Walter looked rather disappointed, having made up his mind that Tom would certainly find a big lump of gold, and come home rich.[Pg 171] \"Don\u0027t you think Tom will find some gold?\" he asked. \"Yes, I have no doubt he will gather some gold-dust. I have no doubt, too, that he will earn more than he or I can do at home; but I haven\u0027t much faith in these extraordinary pieces of good luck.\" \"Still, Tom may find a nugget,\" persisted Walter. \"Yes, he may, and I shall be very glad if he does; but we must not build too many air-castles on that chance.\" \"I wish I could see the dear boy again,\" sighed his mother, looking up from the stocking she was laboriously darning. \"So do I,\" said Walter. \"He would have a lot to tell us.\" \"California seems so far away,\" resumed Mrs. Nelson, \"and he has no one there to look after him, and mend his clothes—\" \"And darn his stockings,\" said Walter, smiling. \"If he walked all the way across the continent,\"[Pg 172] said Sarah, \"I don\u0027t believe he would have larger holes in his stockings than you have, Walter.\" \"Oh, well, I exercise a good deal,\" said Walter. \"Ask father if I don\u0027t.\" \"Walter will be more successful as a farmer than as a scholar,\" said Mr. Nelson. \"He helps me a good deal.\" \"Tom was a good scholar,\" said Sarah, \"and he was always ready to work too. Walter will never astonish or electrify the world by his learning.\" \"I don\u0027t want to,\" said her brother. \"It isn\u0027t in my line.\" \"That\u0027s true enough.\" \"Don\u0027t tease Walter,\" said Mrs. Nelson. \"He helps your father a good deal, and he is not a dunce.\" \"Thank you, mother, for taking my part. Sarah is going to be a strong-minded woman. I should not wonder if she came out as a lecturer on \u0027Woman\u0027s Rights\u0027 some time. I think I see her, with a pair of iron-bowed spectacles on[Pg 173] her nose, and her back hair tied up in a big knot, flinging her arms about, and—\" \"That\u0027ll do, Walter,\" said Sarah. \"It is an unusually powerful effort for you. I have no desire to lecture on \u0027Woman\u0027s Rights,\u0027 though I think they ought to have them all the same.\" \"I guess you\u0027ll get yours. You\u0027ll make your husband stand round, if you ever get one.\" Sarah laughed good-naturedly, and retorted, \"I shall pity your wife, if she has to darn your stockings.\" The next day about dinner-time Squire Hudson walked up to the front door, and knocked. His approach was witnessed, not without trepidation, for he was not an easy creditor. The squire looked about him searchingly as he entered. He suspected that the interest was not ready, and the farmer\u0027s grave face confirmed his suspicions. That he was glad of this of course Mark Nelson did not dream, for he was not aware of his creditor\u0027s deep-laid plans. \"A fine day!\" said the squire, with suavity. \"I hope you are well, Mrs. Nelson.\"[Pg 174] \"Pretty well, thank you, sir.\" \"Have you heard from Tom lately?\" \"Yes; he had just reached California.\" \"Then of course he could not say anything of his prospects?\" \"It was too soon.\" \"You must miss him a good deal—all of you.\" \"I am thinking of him all the time,\" said Mrs. Nelson. \"To be sure, that is natural in a mother. But if the boy does well, that will repay you hereafter.\" \"If I only felt sure he would do well.\" \"Oh, he is young and industrious. He will be sure to make his way. He\u0027ll like it too. Why, my Sinclair envies him the chance of leaving home. He wanted to go with him.\" \"Sinclair would not like to go in the same way as Tom, with the prospect of having to work hard after he got there,\" said Mark Nelson. \"To be sure not, neighbor Nelson. My boy has never been brought up to work. My circumstances—ahem!—have[Pg 175] not made it necessary.\" \"Sinclair is fortunate in having a rich father,\" said the farmer. \"So I tell him,\" said the squire, complacently. \"His fortune is already made.\" \"What are you going to do with him, squire?\" \"Oh, I shall make a professional man of him,—a lawyer, most likely,\" said the rich man, complacently. \"I can give him a suitable income till he gets into a paying practice.\" \"That will be a good many years,\" thought Sarah, \"unless Sinclair works harder than he has lately at school;\" but the shrewd young lady kept this thought to herself. One by one wife and children left the room, for it was well understood that the squire came on business, and would be likely to desire a private interview with the farmer. They went into the kitchen, closing the door behind them, and awaited anxiously the result of the interview.[Pg 176] \"I do hope Squire Hudson will be considerate,\" said Mrs. Nelson, anxiously. \"I am afraid he won\u0027t be, mother,\" said Sarah. \"He is a hard man.\" \"Sinclair puts on no end of airs,\" said Walter. \"By the way he struts round you would think he owned the whole town. You had better set your cap for him, Sarah, for he will be rich some day.\" \"I would rather be an old maid than marry him,\" said Sarah, decidedly. \"Very likely your wish will be gratified,\" said her brother. Mrs. Nelson did not smile at this sally, for her mind was too full of anxiety.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81902.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
