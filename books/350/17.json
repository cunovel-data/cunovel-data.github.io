{"id":25806,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. UP A TREE.","content":"The race between the Yankee and the bear was an exciting one, to the former at least. He was fleet of foot, and in a hundred yards\u0027 dash would have won without great difficulty; but in wind and endurance the grizzly excelled him. So, as the race continued, Mr. Onthank, looking back from time to time, was painfully conscious that his enemy was gaining upon him. The perspiration came out upon his face in large drops, and he panted painfully. He felt that the chances were against him, and he could almost feel in advance the fatal hug which would slowly press the life out of him. As he felt his strength failing he looked around him despairingly. Just before him was a moderate-sized tree. Though he knew that bears can climb, he gathered his remaining strength, seized a low hanging branch, and swung himself[Pg 150] up just in time to avoid his persistent foe, who was close upon his heels. He did not tarry where he was, but climbed higher up, until from a height of twenty feet he could look down upon the bear. Bruin looked up placidly, but did not begin to climb at once. Probably he was fatigued with his race. Moreover he knew that his intended victim could not get away. The latter was emphatically and literally \"treed.\" The bear sat upon his haunches and complacently regarded the Yankee. Ebenezer Onthank made himself as comfortable as he could under the circumstances. He was by no means easy in mind, however. He was \"holding the fort,\" it is true; but the enemy was in force outside, and evidently intended to remain. Worse still, he would probably after a while climb the tree, and this would bring matters to a crisis. \"You pesky critter! Why don\u0027t you go along about your business?\" exclaimed the unhappy adventurer, shaking his fist at the foe.[Pg 151] Bruin deigned no reply, but continued to survey him with steady, unwinking eyes. \"If I only had a gun, I\u0027d pepper you,\" continued Ebenezer. \"I should like to put a bullet into that impudent eye of yours.\" Though the bear had never received an English education, his instinct probably enabled him to understand the feelings of his intended victim, but he remained as placid as ever. So an hour passed. At the end of that time the situation remained unchanged. The unfortunate Yankee was getting hungry, as well as tired of his somewhat constrained position. Bears probably have more patience than the human family, for Bruin had scarcely moved, except occasionally to wag his great head. He felt that in the game that was being played it was his adversary\u0027s turn to make the next move. \"I wish Tom and the Scotchman would find me out,\" thought Onthank. \"What on earth makes them sleep so late?\" he continued, irritably. \"They must be naturally lazy.\" He may be excused for feeling irritated, though[Pg 152] there was no particular reason to expect his two friends to curtail their hours of slumber because he had done so. But he was not in a position where it is easy to be reasonable, and in his situation every minute seemed to him as long as five. Meanwhile, in the camp, a mile away, Tom and Ferguson had awakened. \"How did you sleep, Tom?\" asked the Scotchman. \"Tip-top. Did you rest well?\" \"I have a gift of sleep,\" replied Ferguson. \"But where is our Yankee friend?\" \"I suppose he has taken an early walk,\" said Tom. \"He will be back before long, I guess. We\u0027d better not wait breakfast for him. I\u0027m hungry for one.\" The two friends proceeded to break their fast, washing down the rather stale provisions with water from a spring near by. \"I wish it were coffee,\" said Tom. \"I\u0027m tired of cold water.\" \"Doubtless the coffee would be more gratifying[Pg 153] to the palate, Tom; but it\u0027s likely the water is better for the health.\" \"I suppose you would refuse a cup of hot coffee, Mr. Ferguson, if it were offered you,\" said Tom, smiling. \"I don\u0027t say that, Tom. I would risk its effect upon my health for once. But, as we haven\u0027t got it, we may as well make the best of what we have.\" Soon after their simple meal, which did not consume much time, Tom suggested to his companion that they set out in search of Mr. Onthank. He did not suspect that their missing companion was in trouble, but he thought that it would be pleasant to take a walk. \"You can go, if you like, Tom,\" said Ferguson, with characteristic caution. \"I will remain behind to look after the camp.\" \"All right, Mr. Ferguson. I\u0027ll soon be back.\" \"Don\u0027t go too far away, my lad; and mind your bearings, so that you can find your way back.\" \"Never fear, Mr. Ferguson. It wouldn\u0027t be[Pg 154] very easy to be lost here. I\u0027ll keep my eyes open, and bring Mr. Onthank back with me if I see him anywhere.\" Ferguson sat down, and indulged himself in reading, probably for the hundredth time, Walter Scott\u0027s Marmion, of which he had a small pocket edition; while Tom went on his way. A fortunate chance directed our hero by an almost straight course to the very tree where Ebenezer Onthank was still perched with the grizzly standing guard beneath. From time to time he looked about him anxiously, in the hope of seeing the approach of one of his travelling companions. It was with a feeling of joy, not wholly unmingled with anxiety, that he descried Tom descending a hillock not many rods away. As yet it was evident that our hero had not caught sight of the bear and his prisoner. It was very necessary to put him on his guard. \"Tom!\" shouted Mr. Onthank, at the top of his voice. Tom heard the call in spite of the distance, and[Pg 155] looked about him, but did not immediately catch sight of the speaker. It did not occur to him to look upwards. \"Tom!\" shouted the Yankee again. \"Here I am. Look up in the tree.\" That time Tom\u0027s glance detected his companion, and, not yet having discovered the bear, he was led to wonder why Mr. Onthank had climbed the tree. As he was advancing incautiously, Onthank shouted again, \"There\u0027s a cursed grizzly under the tree. Don\u0027t come too near.\" Tom saw the bear, and he paused suddenly. He was startled in truth, for he had been long enough in California to be aware that it was a dangerous beast. \"Isn\u0027t Ferguson with you?\" asked Onthank, anxiously, for he knew that a boy of sixteen, even if armed, was no match for the king of the California sierras. \"No, he\u0027s behind in the camp,\" shouted Tom, in reply. By this time the bear became aware that there was a second intruder within his precincts. He[Pg 156] turned his head deliberately and surveyed our hero. It is not within the range of the author to read the thoughts of a grizzly, but, from the indifference with which he turned away and resumed his watch, it may be inferred that he considered Tom too small game to merit his attention. This was rather satisfactory to our young hero, who was not ambitious to come in close quarters with so formidable an antagonist. Startled as he was, Tom maintained his ground. He wanted to help Onthank; but he did not know how to do it. \"What can I do to help you, Mr. Onthank?\" shouted Tom. \"Blamed if I know,\" answered the Yankee, helplessly. \"I wish Ferguson were here. It won\u0027t do for you to attack the beast single-handed.\" \"Shall I go back for Ferguson?\" asked Tom. \"I don\u0027t know; how far away is the camp?\" \"It must be as much as a mile.\" \"While you are away the brute may take it into his head to climb th[Pg 157]e tree, and then I am gone up.\" \"Haven\u0027t you any weapon?\" \"No.\" \"I\u0027ll fire at the bear if you say so.\" \"It would be of no use. If you missed, or only grazed him, he would make for you.\" \"I wish you had my rifle,\" said Tom. \"So do I. I\u0027d let him have it straight in the eye. Have you had breakfast?\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m as hungry as a bear—as this bear who probably wants me for his breakfast. O Tom, if I was only back at Green Mountain Mills once more, I\u0027d be content to live and die there, and all the gold in California wouldn\u0027t bring me out here again.\" Tom stood silent and perplexed. While he was considering whether he could do anything to help his friend, the bear slowly rose, approached the tree, and, grasping it between his paws, prepared to climb. He was evidently tired of waiting. \"He\u0027s coming, Tom!\" shouted Onthank. \"O Lord, what shall I do?\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81900.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
