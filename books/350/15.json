{"id":25804,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"Having made all necessary preparations, Ferguson and Tom set out on their way. They took a course differing somewhat from that chosen by John Miles, one object being to survey the country, and find, if possible, a suitable place for continuing their search for gold. After their three months\u0027 steady work both of our travellers were prepared to enjoy the journey. Their road was difficult at times, from its steepness, and more than once they found it necessary, out of consideration for the horse, to get out and walk. But this only added to the romantic charm of the trip. \"It\u0027s like a constant picnic,\" said Tom. \"I should like to travel this way for a year, if I did not feel the need of working.\" \"We might tire of it after a while,\" suggested Ferguson,—\"in the rainy season, for example.\"[Pg 132] \"That would not be so pleasant, to be sure,\" Tom admitted. \"Do you have such fine scenery in Scotland, Mr. Ferguson?\" \"Our mountains are not so high, my lad, nor our trees so gigantic; but it\u0027s the associations that make them interesting. Every hill has a legend connected with it, and our great novelist, Walter Scott, has invested them with a charm that draws pilgrims from all parts of the world to see them. Now this is a new country—beautiful, I grant, but without a history. Look around you, and you will see nothing to remind you of man. It is nature on a grand scale, I admit, but the soul is wanting.\" \"I like mountains,\" said Tom, thoughtfully. \"There is something grand about them.\" \"There are some famous mountains in your native State, New Hampshire, are there not, Tom?\" \"Yes; but I have only seen them from a distance. They are not above thirty miles away from where I was born; but poor people don\u0027t travel in search of scenery, Mr. Ferguson.\" \"No, my lad, and there\u0027s another thing I have[Pg 133] noticed. We don\u0027t care much for the curiosities that are near us. The people about here, if there are any settled inhabitants, care nothing about the mountains, I doubt.\" \"That is true. In our village at home there is an old man nearly eighty years old who has never visited the mountains, though he has lived near them all his life.\" \"I can well believe it, my lad. But what is that?\" The sound which elicited this exclamation was a loud \"Hollo!\" evidently proceeding from some one in their rear. Both Tom and the Scotchman turned, and their eyes rested on a horseman evidently spurring forward to overtake them. Tom, who was driving, reined in the horse, and brought him to a stop. The horseman was soon even with them. He was evidently a Yankee. All Yankees do not carry about with them an unmistakable certificate of their origin, but Ebenezer Onthank was a typical New Englander. His face was long and thin, his expression shrewd and good-natured, his limbs were long and ungainly. In later life, with[Pg 134] the addition of forty or fifty pounds of flesh, he would be much improved in appearance. \"Good-morning, gentlemen,\" said he. \"It seems kinder good to see a human face again. It ain\u0027t very populous round here, is it?\" \"We haven\u0027t seen any large towns,\" said Tom, smiling. \"Where are you steerin\u0027?\" inquired the Yankee. \"I\u0027m expectin\u0027 to fetch up at San Francisco some time, if I don\u0027t get lost in the woods.\" \"That is our destination, my friend,\" returned Ferguson. \"Would you mind my joining your party?\" asked Onthank. \"It\u0027s lonesome travelin\u0027 by one\u0027s self without a soul to speak to.\" \"We shall be glad of your company,\" said the Scotchman, sincerely, for, though naturally cautious, he could not suspect the new-comer of anything which would make him an undesirable companion. \"Perhaps you\u0027d like to know who I am,\" said the new acquaintance. \"My name is Ebenezer[Pg 135] Onthank, from Green Mountain Mills, in Vermont. My father is deacon of the Baptist Church at home.\" \"I suppose you will take his place when you get older,\" said Tom, gravely. \"No, I guess not. I wonder what Susan Jones would say to my bein\u0027 a deacon!\" and Ebenezer burst into a loud laugh. \"Is Miss Jones a particular friend of yours?\" asked Tom, slyly. \"I should say she was. Why, I expect to marry her when I get home.\" \"I congratulate you.\" \"Don\u0027t be too fast. We ain\u0027t hitched yet. Say, boy, where do you come from?\" \"From Vernon, in New Hampshire.\" \"You don\u0027t say! Why, that ain\u0027t more\u0027n fifty miles from Green Mountain Mills; cu\u0027rus we should meet so fur away from hum, ain\u0027t it? When did you start?\" \"Seven or eight months ago.\" \"I\u0027ve been in California six months. Does that gentleman come from your town?\"[Pg 136] \"My friend,\" answered the Scotchman, not without a touch of pride, \"I am not an American; I am from the Highlands of Scotland.\" \"You be? Sho! Well, of course you can\u0027t help that.\" \"Help it, sir? I am proud of hailing from the land of Scott and Burns.\" \"Well, I guess it\u0027s a pretty nice sort of country,\" said Mr. Onthank, patronizingly. \"I guess you\u0027ll like America best, though.\" \"I am by no means sure of that, my friend,\" said Ferguson, a little nettled. \"America\u0027s all very well, but—\" \"Why, you could put Scotland into its waist-coat pocket, and there\u0027d be plenty of room left,\" said Ebenezer, energetically. \"I admit that, as regards size, Scotland cannot compare with this country.\" \"Say, have you got mountains as high as them, or trees as high as that?\" pointing to a gigantic redwood. \"No; but size is not everything.\" \"That\u0027s so. Vermont is a little State, but she\u0027s[Pg 137] smart, I tell you. But you haven\u0027t told me your names yet.\" \"I am called Donald Ferguson, Mr. Onthank. My young friend here answers to the name of Thomas Nelson.\" \"Commonly called Tom,\" added our hero, smiling. \"Why, I\u0027ve got a brother Tom,\" said Mr. Onthank. \"Cu\u0027rus, isn\u0027t it?\" Considering that Tom is by no means an uncommon name, it could hardly be called very remarkable, but Tom politely assented. \"Is he older than I am?\" he inquired. \"Yes, my brother Tom is twenty-one years old. I expect he voted at the last town-meeting. I\u0027m four years older than Tom.\" \"Have you been fortunate so far in California, Mr. Onthank?\" \"Can\u0027t say I have. I guess I\u0027ve wandered round too much. Been a sort of rollin\u0027 stone; and my granny used to say that a rollin\u0027 stone gathers no moss. I\u0027ve got about enough money to get me to San Francisco, and I own this animal; but I[Pg 138] haven\u0027t made a fortune yet. What luck have you two had?\" \"Pretty fair, but it will take a good while to make our fortunes. We own this team, and that\u0027s about all we do own.\" \"A sort of an express wagon, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Ain\u0027t goin\u0027 into the express business, be you?\" \"Probably not. We bought it on speculation.\" \"That reminds me of old Sam Bailey in our town. He was always tradin\u0027 horses. Sometimes he made money, and then again he didn\u0027t. How much did you give?\" Tom told him. \"That was a pretty stiff price, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"It would be considered so at home, but we hope to get a good deal more, when we come to sell it.\" Their new friend kept on with them, amusing them with his homely sayings, and original views of things. His conversation beguiled the tedium of the journey, so that all were surprised when[Pg 139] the shadows deepened, and supper-time came. Selecting a favorable place they encamped for the night. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81898.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
