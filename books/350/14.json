{"id":25803,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. A SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT.","content":"It leaked out after a while that Tom and Ferguson were intending to leave River Bend, and considerable regret was expressed by the other members of the party. Tom was a general favorite. His youth and his obliging disposition made him liked by all except Missouri Jack and his set. It cannot be said that his Scotch friend was popular, but he was, at all events, highly respected as a man of high principle and rigid honesty. This was not the way the miners expressed it. They called him a \"square\" man, and that word expressed high moral praise. They all felt that Tom was going off in good company. Before they went, the two had a chance for a speculation. Two weeks before, a man came to River Bend, across the country, with a horse and[Pg 122] wagon, the latter an old express wagon, which he had brought round the Horn from some one of the Eastern States. What had induced him to take so much trouble to convey such bulky articles was not quite clear. Now that he was a miner he had no use for them, and at River Bend they were not saleable. This man, Abner Kent, came to Ferguson\u0027s tent, where he and Tom were resting after the labors of the day. He was a tall man, with a shambling gait and an angular face. \"Good-evening,\" he said. \"If you ain\u0027t busy I\u0027ll sit down a few minutes.\" \"We are glad to see you Mr. Kent,\" said Ferguson. \"Tom and I were discussing our plans, but we\u0027ve plenty of time for that. Come in. Here\u0027s a place for you.\" \"I hear that you are going to leave us, you two?\" \"Yes, Tom has some business in San Francisco, and I want to see a little more of the country.\"[Pg 123] \"How are you going?\" \"We\u0027ll take the cars if we can find any,\" answered Tom. \"If we can\u0027t we\u0027ll foot it.\" \"That\u0027s what I came to see you about. You know I\u0027ve got a horse and wagon.\" \"Yes.\" \"Why don\u0027t you buy it? You\u0027ll go easier and quicker.\" \"We can\u0027t afford it,\" said Ferguson. \"Poor men must walk.\" \"You don\u0027t see the point. When you get through with the team, you can easily sell them for more than you gave. It will be a good speculation.\" \"That will depend on how much we give,\" said the Scotchman, shrewdly. \"To be sure, Mr. Ferguson. Now about that, I\u0027ll be easy. They ain\u0027t any good to me here. I\u0027ll take—let me see—four hundred dollars cash. You\u0027ll maybe double your money inside of a month.\" The team did seem cheap at this price, as prices of all articles in a new country are very much enhanced.[Pg 124] \"Tom and I will talk it over and let you know to-morrow morning,\" said Ferguson. \"That\u0027s all right. It\u0027s a good chance for you.\" When Kent was gone Tom asked, \"What do you think of his offer, Mr. Ferguson?\" \"I think it will be a good investment, Tom, and that we shall be less likely to be robbed than if we carried gold-dust with us. You know how John Miles got robbed.\" \"I have only a hundred dollars,\" said Tom, doubtfully. \"I have enough to add to it, but I think we can get the team cheaper. I don\u0027t want to beat the man down, but a bargain is a bargain, and we must look out for our own interest.\" \"You know more about such things than I do, Mr. Ferguson; I will agree to anything you say.\" \"Very well, my lad, I shall be sure to consult your interest as well as my own. It will be very comfortable for us to have a team of our own.\"[Pg 125] \"It will seem strange to me,\" said Tom, laughing. \"What will they think at home when they hear that I have set up a carriage?\" \"They might think it imprudent to invest all you had in that way; but we\u0027ll make money out of it yet, or I am sorely mistaken.\" The next morning, while Tom and Ferguson were at work, Kent came up to them. \"What have you decided about the team?\" he asked. \"We are not willing to pay four hundred dollars,\" said Ferguson. \"That\u0027s a fair price.\" \"It may be, but it will take all the money Tom and I can raise. You know it wouldn\u0027t be quite prudent for us to part with all our funds.\" \"I will take a note for part of the money,\" said Kent. \"That\u0027s very considerate of you, but scarcely prudent.\" \"Then don\u0027t you want it at all?\" asked Kent, disappointed.[Pg 126] \"Yes; we are prepared with an offer. We\u0027ll give you three hundred dollars.\" Kent shook his head. \"That\u0027s too little,\" he said. Ferguson remained silent. He wished to give Kent time to reflect upon his offer. \"Have you sold these claims of yours?\" asked Kent, after a pause. \"No.\" \"Then add them to your offer, and I accept it.\" This proposal struck Ferguson favorably. They could not carry away their claims, and very possibly no other purchaser might offer, as, except as regards location, other places along the river-bank could be had without cost. \"What do you say, Tom?\" asked Ferguson. \"I agree if you do, Mr. Ferguson.\" \"Then it\u0027s a bargain, Mr. Kent. I hope it\u0027ll prove satisfactory to both of us.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll regret it. It\u0027s a good speculation.\" When the two friends had settled for their[Pg 127] purchase, Tom paying one hundred and Ferguson two hundred dollars, our hero found himself left with twenty dollars, or its equivalent in gold-dust, while his companion had about one hundred and fifty left over. \"We shall go off in style,\" said Tom; \"riding in our own carriage. But there\u0027s one thing I have been thinking of. I want to send a hundred dollars home as soon as I get the chance. Suppose we can\u0027t sell the team?\" \"Have no fears about that, Tom. I\u0027ll lend you the money if that is the case; but, mark my word, we shan\u0027t have it left on our hands, of that you may be sure.\" The night before they were to start Lawrence Peabody dropped in. He was looking down in the mouth. \"How does the world use you, Mr. Peabody?\" inquired Tom. \"Fortune is against me,\" said Peabody. \"I\u0027m tired of River Bend.\" Tom glanced at his companion. He could guess what was coming.[Pg 128] \"Won\u0027t you take me with you, Tom?\" entreated the young Bostonian. \"You must ask Mr. Ferguson. He is the head of our party.\" Peabody looked appealingly towards Ferguson, but the Scotchman shook his head. \"You mustn\u0027t be offended, Mr. Peabody,\" he said, \"when I tell you that you are responsible for your own bad luck. You have had just as good a chance as Tom or I.\" \"Your claim was better.\" \"There was no difference that I can see, except that we worked, and you didn\u0027t. You don\u0027t expect gold to come to you?\" \"You and Tom are more used to hard work than I,\" murmured Peabody. \"If you did not feel able to work, you should not have come to California. A man must work harder here than at home, and then he stands a chance of succeeding better.\" \"Then you won\u0027t take me?\" asked Peabody, sadly.[Pg 129] \"Are you in debt to Captain Fletcher for board?\" Peabody reluctantly admitted that he was, but had no idea how much he owed. \"Fletcher tells me that he shall not trust you any longer.\" Lawrence Peabody looked frightened. \"What shall I do?\" he faltered. \"I shall starve.\" \"You can\u0027t blame the captain; he knows that you spend the little money you do earn at the saloon. But he will give you a chance. There is no one to wash clothes in the camp, and we have all observed that you keep yours looking well. If you will set up a laundry, you can make more money than in any other way.\" \"But then I should be a common washer-woman,\" objected Peabody. \"What would my friends in Boston say?\" \"They won\u0027t hear of it. Besides, a man can do here what he would not do at home.\" It may be stated here that Peabody, finding work absolutely needful, went into partnership[Pg 130] with a Chinaman, who arrived at the camp a day or two later, and succeeded in making a fair living, which hitherto he had been unable to do. After he was employed, his visits to the saloon became less frequent. At times he was disturbed by the fear that his friends at home might learn the character of his employment; apart from this he found his new business, with the income it yielded, not distasteful. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81897.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
