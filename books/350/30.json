{"id":25819,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. BAD NEWS FROM HOME.","content":"Arriving in the city late in the afternoon, Tom went at once to see John Miles. When the latter caught sight of Tom, in his ragged attire, he came to the natural conclusion that our hero had met with hard luck. \"Why, Tom, where did you spring from?\" he exclaimed, grasping the hand of his young partner. \"I am just in from the mines.\" \"I suppose you are in want of money,\" said Miles, his voice betraying sympathy. Tom laughed. \"How do you like my appearance, John?\" he asked. \"Never mind that, Tom. I see you have had a rough time; but I have been earning money for you.\"[Pg 264] \"Did you send money regularly to father?\" \"Yes; I have sent him three hundred dollars in all.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" said Tom, in a tone of satisfaction. \"That has made him easy. I suppose that took up about all I was entitled to?\" \"No; I have as much more to your credit. I am ready to pay it to you at once.\" \"I see, John, you think I have not been doing well.\" \"You don\u0027t look very prosperous, Tom, I must acknowledge.\" \"Well, John, appearances are deceitful. I have been wonderfully lucky.\" \"I am delighted to hear it, Tom,\" said Miles, cordially. \"How much is it now?\" \"What do you say to a thousand dollars?\" \"Excellent.\" \"Two thousand?\" \"You don\u0027t mean it!\" \"I won\u0027t keep you in suspense, John. I don\u0027t know exactly how much I\u0027ve got, but it\u0027s over six thousand dollars!\"[Pg 265] John Miles stared at our hero in undisguised astonishment. \"Are you sure you\u0027re quite right here?\" he said, touching his forehead. \"You haven\u0027t been sun-struck, have you?\" \"No, John, it\u0027s all as I tell you. Let me explain how my luck came.\" In a few sentences Tom made it clear to his partner that his luck was real. \"As to the three hundred dollars due me from you, John,\" concluded Tom, \"I make you a present of it.\" \"But, Tom—\" protested Miles. \"Let it be so, and for the future you shall pay me my share. Have you any letters for me?\" \"I have three.\" \"Give them to me, quick. I am hungry for news from home.\" Tom sat down on a keg, and fairly devoured the letters, two of which were from his father. One of these gave him much to think of. I will transcribe the passages which gave Tom most concern:—[Pg 266] \"Yesterday I paid Squire Hudson his regular semi-annual interest, amounting to sixty-six dollars. Thanks to your liberal remittances, I had no difficulty in making the payment. Indeed, I had two hundred dollars left over. Imagine my dismay when the squire told me he had made up his mind to call in the mortgage, having another use for the money. \"\u0027But I can\u0027t pay it up,\u0027 said I. \"\u0027You ought to be able to obtain the money somewhere,\u0027 he returned. \"\u0027You are the only capitalist with whom I am acquainted,\u0027 said I. \u0027Since I have paid you the interest promptly, what more can you desire?\u0027 \"He insisted that he needed the money. I offered to pay him the two hundred dollars which he had advanced for your journey. He seemed surprised, but repeated that he must have the whole. The upshot of it was that he gave me a formal notice of three months, as stipulated in the mortgage. At the end of that time, unless I am ready to pay the twenty-two hundred dollars, he will foreclose, and the old farm must be sold.[Pg 267] Of course it will be sold much below its real value. Probably the squire will get it for the amount of the mortgage, and we shall be thrown upon the world, without a home. It seems hard, Tom, and very selfish; but might makes right, and Squire Hudson has the power on his side.\" In a postscript Mark Nelson added, \"I understand that Squire Hudson has a connection, his wife\u0027s brother, for whom he wants the farm. That explains his resolute refusal to give me time to redeem it. Of course it is too early to decide upon any plans. I must hire some tenement to move into when I have to leave here. It will be hard upon us all to give up the old farm. Walter, who has a taste for farming, and whom I look to be my successor, feels very sad. Don\u0027t let this news depress you too much, Tom. We shall not suffer. Thanks to you, I have some money ahead, and we shall not lack for comfort.\" Tom looked up when he had finished reading the letter. \"John,\" he said, quickly, \"when does the next steamer start for New York?\"[Pg 268] \"Day after to-morrow.\" \"Where can I engage passage?\" \"Are you going home?\" \"Yes, John, it is absolutely necessary. Squire Hudson is about to foreclose the mortgage on my father\u0027s farm. I must be there to stop it.\" \"Have you money enough?\" \"Three times over. He shall be defeated in his wicked purpose, or my name isn\u0027t Tom Nelson.\" Tom spoke in a quick, indignant tone, and his voice had a manly ring. \"Wait, John, let me read you the letter.\" \"The man\u0027s a mean rascal!\" said Miles. \"A rich man who will take advantage of a poor man\u0027s necessity to deprive him of his home deserves to be horsewhipped.\" \"I shan\u0027t attempt that,\" said Tom, smiling; \"but I will disappoint him. He little thinks I have it in my power to defeat his plans.\" That very evening Tom engaged passage to New York, and two days later he sailed out of the Golden Gate.[Pg 269] \"I don\u0027t know how long I shall be gone, John,\" he said. \"You need send me no remittances, for I have money enough with me. You will hear from me as soon as I have reached home, and transacted my business with Squire Hudson.\" \"You will come out here again, Tom, won\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, and before long. I have been so busily occupied making money that I have seen almost nothing of San Francisco.\" Tom did not journey alone. Ferguson, having thriven beyond his expectations, decided to sail to New York, and thence to Scotland, on a visit to his relatives, though he thought it probable he should come back within a year. Dick Russell also was now in a position to study law at home, and gave up the business of gold-mining forever. \"I owe all my present prosperity to you two,\" he said. \"But for you I should have blown my brains out five months since.\" \"We owe our prosperity to you also,\" said[Pg 270] Tom. \"You guided us to the mines from which we gathered a golden harvest.\" \"We have worked together, and been mutual helpers,\" said Ferguson. \"God has favored us all, and to Him be the thanks!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2973/81913.html","bookId":350,"book":{"id":350,"title":"The Young Miner or Tom Nelson in California","description":"简介： A dozen men, provided with rockers, were busily engaged in gathering and washing dirt, mingled with gold-dust, on the banks of a small stream in California.
