If they were better able to afford one than he was, Bright wished them luck. Now that it was daylight, he could see into all the lowest rooms of the high rise opposite, but there was no sign of life on the first two floors. Perhaps all the tenants were singing the hymns he could hear somewhere in the suburb. He took his time about making himself presentable, and then he went downstairs. The lifts were out of order. Presumably it was a repairman who peered at him through the smeary window of one scrawled metal door on the landing below his. The blurred face startled him so much that he was glad to see people on the third floor. Weren\u0027t they from the building opposite, from one of the apartments that had stayed unlit last night? The woman they had come to visit was losing a smiling contest with them. She stepped back grudgingly, and Bright heard the bolt and chain slide home as he reached the stairs. The public library was on the ground floor. First he strolled to the job center among the locked and armored shops. There was nothing for a printer on the cards, and cards that offered training in a new career were meant for people thirty years younger. They needed the work more than he did, even if they had no families to provide for. He ambled back to the library, whistling a wartime song. The young job-hunters had finished with the newspapers. Bright started with the tabloids, saving the serious papers for the afternoon, though even those suggested that the world over the horizon was seething with disease and crime and promiscuity and wars. Good news wasn\u0027t news, he told himself, but the last girl he\u0027d ever courted before he\u0027d grown too set in his ways was out there somewhere, and the world must be better for her. Still, it was no wonder that most readers came to the library for fiction rather than for the news. He supposed the smiling couple who were filling cartons with books would take them to the housebound, although some of the titles he glimpsed seemed unsuitable for the easily offended. He watched the couple stalk away with the cartons, until the smoke of a distant bonfire obscured them. The library closed at nine. Usually Bright would have been home for hours and listening to his radio cassette player, to Elgar or Vera Lynn or the dance bands his father used to play on the wind-up record player, but something about the day had made him reluctant to be alone. He read about evolution until the librarian began to harrumph loudly and smite books on the shelves. Perhaps Bright should have gone up sooner. When he hurried round the outside of the building to the lobby, he had never seen the suburb so lifeless. Identical gray terraces multiplied to the horizon under a charred sky; a pair of trampled books lay amid the breathless litter on the anonymous concrete walks. He thought he heard a cry, but it might have been the start of the hymn that immediately was all he could hear, wherever it was. The lifts still weren\u0027t working; both sets of doors that gave onto the scribbled lobby were open, displaying thick cables encrusted with darkness. By the time he reached the second floor he was slowing, grasping any banisters that hadn\u0027t been prised out of the concrete. The few lights that were working had been spray-painted until they resembled dying coals. Gangs of shadows flattened themselves against the walls, waiting to mug him. As he climbed, a muffled sound of hymns made him feel even more isolated. They must be on television, he could hear them in so many apartments. One pair of lift doors on the fifth floor had jammed open. Unless Bright\u0027s eyes were the worse for his climb, the cable was shaking. He labored upstairs to his landing, where the corresponding doors were open too. Once his head stopped swimming, he ventured to the edge of the unlit shaft. There was no movement, and nothing on the cable except the underside of the lift on the top floor. He turned toward his apartment. Two men were waiting for him. Apparently they\u0027d rung his bell. They were staring at his door and rubbing their hands stiffly. They wore black T-shirts and voluminous black overalls, and sandals on their otherwise bare feet. \"What can I do for you?\" Bright called. They turned together, holding out their hands as if to show him how gray their palms looked under the stained lamp. Their narrow bland faces were already smiling. \"Ask rather what we can do for you,\" one said. Bright couldn\u0027t tell which of them had spoken, for neither smile gave an inch. They might be two men or even two women, despite their close-cropped hair. \"You could let me at my front door,\" Bright said. They gazed at him as if nothing he might say would stop them smiling, their eyes wide as old pennies stuck under the lids. When he pulled out his key and marched forward, they stepped aside, but only just. As he slipped the key into the lock, he sensed them close behind him, though he couldn\u0027t hear them. He pushed the door open, no wider than he needed to let himself in. They followed him. \"Whoa, whoa.\" He swung round in the stubby vestibule and made a grab at the door, too late. His visitors came plodding in, bumping the door against the wall. Their expressions seemed more generalized than ever. \"What the devil do you think you\u0027re doing?\" Bright cried. That brought their smiles momentarily alive, as though it were a line they\u0027d heard before. \"We haven\u0027t anything to do with him,\" their high flat voices said, one louder than the other. \"And we hope you won\u0027t have,\" one added while his companion mouthed. They seemed no surer who should talk than who should close the door behind them. The one by the hinges elbowed it shut, almost trapping the other before he was in, until the other blundered through and squashed his companion behind the door. They might be fun, Bright supposed, and he could do with some of that. They seemed harmless enough, so long as they didn\u0027t stumble against anything breakable. \"I can\u0027t give you much time,\" he warned them. They tried to lumber into the main room together. One barged through the doorway and the other stumped after him, and they stared about the room. Presumably the blankness of their eyes meant they found it wanting, the sofa piled with Blight\u0027s clothes awaiting ironing, the snaps he\u0027d taken on his walks in France and Germany and Greece, the portrait of herself his last girlfriend had given him, the framed copy of the article he\u0027d printed for the newspaper shortly before he\u0027d been made redundant, about how life should be a hundred years from now, advances in technology giving people more control over their own lives. He resented the disapproval, but he was more disconcerted by how his visitors looked in the light of his apartment: gray from heads to toes, as if they needed dusting. \"Who are you?\" he demanded. \"Where are you from?\" \"We don\u0027t matter.\" \"Atter,\" the other agreed, and they said almost in unison: \"We\u0027re just vessels of the Word.\" \"Better give it to me, then,\" Bright said, staying on his feet so as to deter them from sitting: God only knew how long it would take them to stand up. \"I\u0027ve a lot to do before I can lie down.\" They turned to him as if they had to move their whole bodies to look. Whichever responded, the voice through the fixed smile sounded more pinched than ever. \"What do you call your life?\" They had no reason to feel superior to him. The gray ingrained in their flesh suggested disuse rather than hard work, and disused was how they smelled in the small room. \"I\u0027ve had a fair life, and it\u0027s only right I should make way for someone who can work the new machines. I\u0027ve had enough of a life to help me cope with the dole.\" His visitors stared as if they meant to dull him into accepting whatever they were offering. The sight of their faces stretched tight by their smiles was so disagreeably fascinating that he jumped, having lost his sense of time passing, when one spoke. \"Your life is empty until you let him in.\" \"Isn\u0027t two of you enough? Who\u0027s that, now?\" The figure on his left reached in a pocket, and the overalls pulled flat at the crotch. The jerky hand produced a videocassette that bore a picture of a priest. \"I can\u0027t play that,\" Bright said. His visitors pivoted sluggishly to survey the room. Their smiles turned away from him, turned back unchanged. They must have seen that his radio could play cassettes, for now the righthand visitor was holding one. \"Listen before it\u0027s too late,\" they urged in unison. \"As soon as I\u0027ve time.\" Bright would have promised more just then to rid himself of their locked smiles and their stale sweetish odor. He held open the door to the vestibule and shrank back as one floundered in the doorway while the other fumbled at the outer door. He held his breath as the second set of footsteps plodded through the vestibule, and let out a gasp of relief as the outer door slammed. Perhaps deodorants were contrary to their faith. He opened the window and leaned into the night to breathe. More of the building opposite was unlit, as if a flood of darkness were rising through the floors, and he would have expected to see more houses lit by now. He could hear more than one muffled hymn, or perhaps the same one at different stages of its development. He was wondering where he\u0027d seen the face of the priest on the videocassette. When the smoke of a bonfire began to scrape his throat, he closed the window. He set up the ironing board and switched on the electric iron. It took him half an hour to press his clothes, and he still couldn\u0027t remember what he\u0027d read about the priest. Perhaps he could remind himself. He carried the radio to his chair by the window. As he lifted the cassette out of its plastic box, he winced. A sharp corner of the cassette had pricked him. He sucked his thumb and gnawed it to dislodge the sliver of plastic that had penetrated his skin. He dropped the cassette into the player and snapped the aperture shut, then he switched on, trying to ignore the ache in his thumb. He heard a hiss, the click of a microphone, a voice. \"I am Father Lazarus. I\u0027m going to tell you the whole truth,\" it said. It was light as a disc jockey\u0027s voice, and virtually sexless. Bright knew the name; perhaps he would be able to place it now that the ache was fading. \"If you knew the truth,\" the voice said, \"wouldn\u0027t you want to help your fellow man by telling him?\" \"Depends,\" Bright growled, blaming the voice for the injury to his thumb. \"And if you\u0027ve just said no, don\u0027t you see that proves you don\u0027t know the truth?\" \"Ho ho, very clever,\" Bright scoffed. The absence of the pain was unexpectedly comforting: it felt like a calm in which he need do nothing except let the voice reach him. \"Get on with it,\" he muttered. \"Christ was the truth. He was the word that couldn\u0027t deny itself although they made him suffer all the torments of the damned. Why would they have treated him like that if they hadn\u0027t been afraid of the truth? He was the truth made flesh, born without the preamble of lust and never indulging in it himself, and we have only to become vessels of the truth to welcome him back before it\u0027s too late.\" Not too late to recall where he\u0027d seen the priest\u0027s face, Bright thought, if he didn\u0027t nod off first, he felt so numbed. \"Look around you,\" the voice was saying, \"and see how late it is. Look and see the world ending in corruption and lust and man\u0027s indifference.\" The suggestion seemed knowing. If you looked out at the suburb, you would see the littered walkways where nobody walked at night except addicts and muggers and drunks. There was better elsewhere, Bright told himself, and managed to turn his head on its stiff neck toward the portrait photograph. \"Can you want the world to end this way?\" the priest demanded. \"Isn\u0027t it true that you wish you could change it but feel helpless? Believe me, you can. Christ says you can. He had to suffer agonies for the truth, but we offer you the end of pain and the beginning of eternal life. The resurrection of the body has begun.\" Not this body, Bright thought feebly. His injured hand alone felt as heavy as himself. Even when he realized that he\u0027d left the iron switched on, it seemed insufficient reason for him to move. \"Neither men nor women shall we be in the world to come,\" the voice was intoning. \"The flesh shall be freed of the lusts that have blinded us to the truth.\" He blamed sex for everything, Bright mused, and instantly he remembered. EVANGELIST IS VOODOO WIDOWER, the headline inside a tabloid had said, months ago. The priest had gone to Haiti to save his wife\u0027s people, only for her to return to her old faith and refuse to go home with him. Hadn\u0027t he been quoted in the paper as vowing to use his enemies\u0027 methods to defeat them? Certainly he\u0027d announced that he was renaming himself Lazarus. His voice seemed to be growing louder, so loud that the speaker ought to be vibrating. \"The Word of God will fill your emptiness. You will go forth to save your fellow man and be rewarded on the day of judgment. Man was made to praise God, and so he did until woman tempted him in the garden. When the sound of our praise is so great that it reaches heaven, our savior shall return.\" Bright did feel emptied, hardly there at all. If giving in to the voice gave him back his strength, wouldn\u0027t that prove it was telling the truth? But he felt as if it wanted to take the place of his entire life. He gazed at the photograph, remembering the good-byes at the bus station, the last kiss and the pressure of her hands on his, the glow of the bus turning the buds on a tree into green fairy lights as the vehicle vanished over the crest of a hill, and then he realized that the priest\u0027s voice had stopped. He felt as if he\u0027d outwitted the tape until a choir began the hymn he had been hearing all day. The emptiness within him was urging him to join in, but he wouldn\u0027t while he had any strength. He managed to suck his bottom lip between his teeth and gnaw it, though he wasn\u0027t sure if he could feel even a distant ache. Voodoo widower, he chanted to himself to break up the oppressive repetition of the hymn, voodoo widower. He was fending off the hymn, though it seemed impossibly loud in his head, when he heard another sound. The outer door was opening. He couldn\u0027t move, he couldn\u0027t even call out. The numbness that had spread from his thumb through his body had sculpted him to the chair. He heard the outer door slam as bodies blundered voicelessly about the vestibule. The door to the room inched open, then jerked wide, and the two overalled figures struggled into the room. He\u0027d known who they were as soon as he\u0027d heard the outer door. The hymn on the tape must have been a signal that he was finished - that he was like them. They\u0027d tampered with the latch on their way out, he realized dully. He seemed incapable of feeling or reacting, even when the larger of the figures leaned down to gaze into his eyes, presumably to check that they were blank, and Bright saw how the gray, stretched lips were fraying at the corners. For a moment Bright thought the man\u0027s eyes were going to pop out of their seedy sockets at him, yet he felt no inclination to flinch. Perhaps he was recognizing himself as he would be - yet didn\u0027t that mean he wasn\u0027t finished after all? The man stood back from scrutinizing him and turned up the volume of the hymn. Bright thought the words were meant to fill his head, but he could still choose what to think. He wasn\u0027t that empty, he\u0027d done his bit of good for the world, he\u0027d stood aside to give someone else a chance. Whatever the priest had brought back from Haiti might have deadened Bright\u0027s body, but it hadn\u0027t quite deadened his mind. He fixed his gaze on the photograph and thought of the day he\u0027d walked on a mountain with her. He was beginning to fight back toward his feelings when the other man came out of the kitchen, bearing the sharpest knife in the place. They weren\u0027t supposed to make Bright suffer, the tape had said so. He could see no injuries on them. Suppose there were mutilations that weren\u0027t visible? \"Neither men nor women shall we be in the world to come.\" At last Bright understood why his visitors seemed sexless. He tried to shrink back as the man who had turned up the hymn took hold of the electric iron. The man grasped it by the point before he found the handle. Bright saw the gray skin of his fingers curl up like charred paper, but the man didn\u0027t react at all. He closed his free hand around the handle and waited while his companion plodded toward Bright, the edge of the knife blade glinting like a razor. \"It helps if you sing,\" said the man with the knife. Though Bright had never been particularly religious, nobody could have prayed harder than he started to pray then. He was praying that by the time the first of them reached him, he would feel as little as they did.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/book-of-the-dead/page-3.html","bookId":2562,"book":{"id":2562,"title":"Book Of The Dead","description":"Storyline: Book of the Dead by John Skipp (Editor), Craig Spector (Editor), Glen Vasey, Les Daniels, Douglas E.
