{"id":30440,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV PARADISE WARD ON WHEELS","content":"THE little gray house in Prattsboro, opposite Mrs. Hamilton Garde’s garage, saw busy hours throughout that sultry July night of Sardis Merrifield’s message. Aunt Sophie and a kindly neighbor mended and stitched and washed and ironed and packed, to get Dolly ready for her journey next day and the outdoor months to follow. Meanwhile the little maid for whom they labored slept quietly in the adjoining room, all unknowing of the delights in store for her. The next morning at eight o’clock a little procession waited in front of the Children’s House of Joy, making ready for its start on the long journey to Overlook Mountain. At the head stood Colonel Gresham’s seven-passenger car, in charge of John, the Colonel’s chauffeur. Next came No. 45678; then Russell Ely, who had placed himself and his car at Polly’s disposal; while Colonel Gresham’s small truck, piled with all manner of luggage, tagged the three. The children were chattering and snickering as only little people can. There were last words to say, last bundles to dispose of, and all was hilarity and happiness. [101] “Now, father,” said Polly, “remember that you have promised to come up in August for a few days at the least, and you must plan to make it a week if you possibly can. You owe it to yourself and to your patients. I do wish you and mother could come together.” She looked appealingly into Mrs. Dudley’s eyes. Her mother smilingly shook her head. “I’ll try to come,” she said, “and I’ll do my very best to make your father keep his promise; but I’m afraid we can’t come at the same time.” “When are we goin’?” piped up Timmy, flinging the query in Polly’s direction. “As soon as I can make this box stay where it belongs,” she laughed. “There! I believe that’s positively the last.” Her eyes scanned the running-board, the walk, even the roadway. Was everything in? She paused, thinking. “Don’t try to find a single package more,” laughed Lilith. “If we don’t start pretty soon—” “Oh! I forgot—” She dashed towards the house. “What? What?” cried those nearest. “Ain’t we goin’?” queried a worried little voice. Russell was already leaping after Polly, while Lilith reassured the anxious tot. In a moment the two runaways reappeared in the doorway, Russell carrying Polly’s forgotten lunch basket. This made the grown folks laugh. Then everybody[102] said good-bye. There was a waving of hands, the cars burr-r-ed and sizzed and smoked; there were more good-byes and hand-wavings—and they were on the long way to Overlook. Reaching Prattsboro Polly Dudley’s car whirled ahead of the procession and speeded around to the little gray house. Dolly Merrifield was at the window, ready from hat to shoe, and even more radiant than usual. “I never was so taken back in my life,” declared Aunt Sophie, looking up from the suitcase she was strapping. “I got a letter from Sardis just now, telling why he didn’t answer mine. He hadn’t got it! And to think your father should take the trouble to write! Well, if he hadn’t, Dolly could not have gone—that’s all. I’m mighty glad he did, and we all are. Why, Sardis says he went to the post-office and there wasn’t any letter from me. You see, it got mixed up with somebody else’s mail, and he hadn’t got it even then; but he’d heard about it, though. Such doings! “According to Sardis, anything your father says, goes. I didn’t know he knew him; but it seems he’d heard all about him—when he was down at Yale, I guess. He says he wouldn’t have Dolly miss it for anything. Dear me, this string ain’t long enough! I’ll have to tie a piece on. Thank you. Guess my fingers are nervous. There, that’s all! My! all those autos going? Won’t you have a splendid time! How far’d you say it was?” [103] “About a hundred and forty miles.” “My!” ejaculated Mrs. Edmonson again. “Well, you’ve got a lovely day. You’ll let me know how Dolly stood it, won’t you?” she asked a bit anxiously as she followed the others to the sidewalk. “I’ll send you word right away,” Polly reassured her. “Father says she’ll get along all right, and we have a doctor right here, if we should need anything. And a nurse, too,” she laughed. “They are going to be with us all summer.” “Oh, they are!” exclaimed Aunt Sophie in a relieved tone. “I shall feel easier about her, then.” They had reached Polly’s car, and Russell put the little girl on the front seat, between the driver and Lilith. Aunt Sophie stepped upon the running-board and kissed Dolly again, and then backed out to make way for Polly. “I’ll write to you, Aunt Sophie,” promised Dolly. “Don’t work too hard! And don’t forget to take a nap before you do the dishes, ’cause you were up all night!” That was a wonderful ride to most of the passengers. It was just warm enough to be comfortable, with a fresh breeze—exactly such a morning as Polly would have chosen. “Tired, dear?” she questioned, smiling down into the little face. [104] “Not a bit,” Dolly smiled back. “Isn’t it splendid! Aren’t you glad Sardis said yes? I wonder if he ever had such a nice ride.” “I guess so,” laughed Polly; and then, “Have you thought, dear, you will be nearer your brother than when you were at home?” Dolly’s little thin face grew pink, “O—h!” she said softly. “I don’t know just where your brother is. I must look it up. He may be right across the New Hampshire line.” “He is away up in the northern part.” The pink faded. “Never mind, we shall be nearer than when I was down in Prattsboro.” The child wagged her head delightedly, while Polly wondered what kind of brother this was to hold such a place in his little sister’s heart. If he were all that Dolly believed him to be, she should like to know him. The wind died and the air grew warm. Jozy and Esther on the back seat were asleep. “What time is it?” Polly turned to Lilith. “We are pretty near Springfield.” “Quarter of twelve.” “Almost time for dinner. We’ll be on the lookout for a shady spot.” “I’m famished,” declared Lilith. “Isn’t that tree big enough?” “No,” Polly laughed. “If I remember, there is a bit of shade this side of Northampton.” [105] “Do hurry up, then, for I’m sure the tots are starving.” “Are you hungry, dear?” Polly smiled down at Dolly. “Not much.” “Hear that! Where is the lunch basket?” Lilith peered down over the back of her seat. “I believe you hid it away! I don’t see anything familiar.” Polly looked mischievous. “There are chicken sandwiches and cream-cheese sandwiches and chocolate snaps and oranges and coffee and—” “Oh!” Lilith clapped her hands to her ears. “Isn’t she naughty, Dolly?” “No,” answered Dolly; “she couldn’t be—ever.” “You see, I have a stanch champion,” Polly twinkled. “Oh, yes,” sighed Lilith in mock distress, “everybody swears allegiance to you. I foresee what lonesome days I am going to have up on the mountain.” Dolly was looking at the girl with a puzzled expression. Lilith’s face was perfectly serious. “I love you too,” she said sweetly. “Bless her little heart!” cried Lilith. “You and I are going to have a lovely time at Overlook, aren’t we?” “Yes, Miss Lilith,” answered Dolly, yet this was becoming even more perplexing. Hadn’t she just said— [106] Lilith was watching her. “Did you think I was in earnest?” she smiled. “That’s the way Polly and I amuse ourselves. I was only joking. I am delighted to have everybody love Polly.” At which the little face grew bright again. “There!” exclaimed Lilith; “a tree! a tree!—it’s dinner-time!” Polly speeded up the car and whizzed by the designated shrub. “Oh, I say”—and the jester was serious this time—“let me out at that little tea-room or tavern or whatever—honest, Polly, I mean it!” So the car stopped, and the girl disappeared inside the door. Soon she came out, her hands full of ice-cream cones which she served to her fellow-passengers and then ran back for more. Russell drew up beside Polly and leaped out, to follow Lilith. Dr. Abbe was not far behind, and the three returned with more cones, running back and forth until all were supplied. It was a happy thought of Lilith’s, for the children were in ecstasies, and the icy sweets were grateful to everybody. Dr. Abbe and Russell lingered by Polly’s car, the children on the back seat eating and chattering by turns. Suddenly Little Duke’s voice piped high above the others’. “Oh! it’s awful hot; but My hasn’t sweat a hair!” Those on the front seat laughed slyly. “Pretty good,” observed Russell softly. [107] “Amusing little fellow,” returned Dr. Abbe in the same tone. Polly glanced behind. Little Duke, all unconscious of the notice, was engaged in examining his suit of new tan linen which was his especial admiration. Finding it still immaculate, he resumed his ice-cream, remarking, “If My should get a drop on this, it would be enough to drive the angels to drink.” Russell grinned, Dr. Abbe’s lips puckered, Lilith laughed into her handkerchief, while Polly whirled her back towards the small boy, and chuckled. “You seem to be in a fair way to have plenty of entertainment,” observed Russell. “This goes a little ahead of our regular everyday kind,” returned Polly; “but there’s always enough to keep us cheerful.” “It is well we didn’t wait for a woodsy dining-room,” declared Polly, when they were again racing northward. “It doesn’t look as if we’d find one very soon.” It grew hotter and hotter. Polly drove faster. “There’s a lovely place this side of South Deerfield,” observed Lilith. “We’re nearly there, I think. Tired, Dolly dear?” “Some,” she answered softly, with a little wan smile. “We’re going to have dinner,” cried Polly gayly, speeding her car. “Look ahead! See that little[108] wood—that’s where we’re going to stop.” And almost as she spoke the place was reached. “Oh, how beautiful!” breathed Dolly. The four cars drew up on the grass beside the road, lunch boxes were opened, and very shortly everybody was eating and drinking, the grown-ups taking only hurried nibbles until most of the children had a glass of milk in one hand and a chicken sandwich in the other. All felt the refreshment of the cool, green dining-room. The young men poured the ice-cold coffee and lemonade, the girls handed out sandwiches and cookies, oranges and small cakes, until weariness and heat were forgotten, and everybody was in gay morning mood. There was not much to pack away into basket and box when the luncheon was over, only a few cookies and bottles of milk, in case of need later in the day. Just as they were ready to start on again, Polly called Dr. Abbe. He came as if on wings. “At your service,” he bowed. “Would you mind letting Dolly go to sleep in your arms?” she asked. “I think she will be easier there.” “I shall be glad to take her,” was his assurance. “You might change places with one or two of the children here on the back seat,” Polly suggested, noticing the little maid’s troubled face.[109] “Then Dolly will be right with me when she wakes up.” The exchange was quickly made, and on went the cars, on and on, through wide farm lands, beside gurgling streams and quiet lakes. They whirled into pretty villages and out, ran along the foot of hills and skirted deep ravines, where down, down, down, a brook was singing. The mountains drew closer and climbed nearer the clouds. But only the grown people saw and enjoyed it all, for the children, to the very last one, had fallen fast asleep. They had passed through Brattleboro and were following the winding river when—bang! There was an instant outcry, and everybody that was awake peered out to discover the trouble. It was one of Russell’s tires that was responsible for the spoiling of so many naps, and at once his coat was off and he was getting out his tools, begging the rest to go on and promising to follow as soon as possible. But the road was shady and the cars came to a halt, John and Charley running to help with the injured tire. The little folks in Russell’s car were in mild excitement, watching proceedings with great interest. The less fortunate ones, after vainly craning their necks and being unable to get a satisfactory view of the scene, gave themselves up to conversing with their neighbors or finishing their interrupted naps. [110] “I say, it’s a good time for a lunch—” began Polly. “Oh!”—“Oh, do, Miss Dudley!”—“I’m hungrier than anything!”—“What are we goin’ to have?”—“Oh, my! are we goin’ to have ice-cream?” “We’re going to have cookies and milk,” replied Polly. And she began fishing out the cakes from a deep bag. The little folks were all wide awake at once, including Dolly Merrifield, who looked as fresh as need be. Polly and Dr. Abbe walked over to the workers where John, driver of the truck, was pumping. “It was good of you to hold Dolly all this time,” said the girl. “Isn’t she a darling?” “She is,” he answered. And then they fell to talking of the little maid and what they hoped the outing would do for her. The tire was in place, the men were putting on their coats. “Whew, but it’s hot!” ejaculated Russell, wiping his forehead with his grimy handkerchief. “I supposed my tires were in good con—” “Bang!” There was a scream from Polly’s car, a series of screams, and she and the Doctor ran ahead together. The rest came up. “Don’t be frightened, dears! It’s only a tire.” “I thought I was shot!” wailed Jozy. “So did I!” chimed in Grissel. [111] The others laughed. “Pretty big blow-out,” said Russell. He pulled off his coat that was on only one arm. Dr. Abbe regarded it ruefully. “Wish I knew how to help,” he said. “It’s a shame—” began Polly. “It’s fine,” returned Russell; “I’m glad to have a change from driving. They’ve chosen a good, shady spot for it. And the tools are out—all handy.” He ran back for them. They went at the work good-humoredly, and presently the new tire was on, and they were ready to start. “Miss Dudley,” began Jozy, a little shyly, “would you mind—may—may—” “Well, what is it?” urged Polly, one foot on the running-board. “May I—” Jozy began again,—“do you mind if Grissel and me sit in the other car—the big car?” “For what?” asked Polly in astonishment. Jozy didn’t answer. Grissel’s courage leapt forward. “We want to sit in that,” she pointed, “so ’s—so ’s to be there when it goes off.” Polly gave a little shriek of laughter, in which Dr. Abbe joined. The children looked a bit shame-faced; they did not see anything funny. Russell was only a few steps away. He turned back questioningly. “Jozy and Grissel want to sit in the Gresham[112] car, so as to be on the spot when that takes its turn at popping!” Russell shouted, and Jozy began to cry. “Beg pardon, mesdemoiselles,” smiled Russell with a low bow; “but”—glancing at the others—“that is a good one!” Grissel’s lip went up, and she hid her face in her elbow. “Come, come,” coaxed Polly, “there’s nothing to cry about. We don’t expect any more punctures, so you’d better stay where you are.” She waved Russell off and settled herself at the wheel. “What magnificent ferns!” It was Dr. Abbe’s tribute to the mountain road. “Aren’t they beautiful!” responded Lilith. “Polly says it looks as if somebody had been decorating for a wedding.” The Doctor laughed—and blushed. “I wonder if he is going to be married,” thought Lilith. The way wound up and up; but No. 45678 took the steep grade ascent without flinching, and at least one of the party thought Polly managed her car exceedingly well. As they mounted higher and still higher, occasional breaks in the leafy roadsides drew forth exclamations of surprise and admiration from the travelers big and little. Russell drove up alongside the car ahead. “Say,” he called, “this is great! Why didn’t you tell a fellow we were bound for the clouds?” [113] “I thought you knew,” returned Polly. “I’m glad you like it.” “Like it!” Russell took off his hat, and gazed down the valley. “It makes a man feel pretty small,” he said. Near at hand lay rolling, pine-scattered pastures, with now and then a cultivated field or fruited orchard. Farther on, the little town of Overlook stretched itself in a long line from the wooded north to the open south, where shining pleasure cars ran in and out of the covered bridge that spanned the village brook, looking like children’s toys that could rest in the palm of one’s hand. Beyond stood the green hills, with an occasional white farmhouse or a parti-colored bungalow, and then range upon range of hazy mountains until they melted into the sky. On and on went the little procession, up between pines and birches and maples, where bushes hung thick with ripening berries, and finally into the open, leaving weather-worn farmhouses on right and left. Rocky pastures where herds were feeding, orchards whose trees bent with their burden of green fruit, meadows yellow with “butter and eggs” and kingcups; these came into view and disappeared. “There is the site of the old town,” said Polly, waving her hand toward a field of tall grass on her right. “Nearly one hundred years ago Overlook was moved down into the valley, and small stones[114] mark the location of its principal buildings. See that monument over there? That is where the court-house stood. Haven’t you noticed, along the roadside, occasional little numbered granite stones?” “Yes, and I wondered what they were for,” answered Dr. Abbe. “Each marks the site of some house; it tells on the monument what they were.” Everybody looked until the spot was left well behind and a bungalow came into view. “That isn’t ours,” said Polly. “We are going farther to the left. It won’t look familiar even to me, for they are putting on a new piazza and a sleeping-porch—unless they’ve finished them already.” “I see it!” cried Lilith. “And I do believe Benedicta is out watching for us.” She was. And with outspread arms she received them all, her homely face one big welcoming smile. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2764/76282.html","bookId":1338,"book":{"id":1338,"title":"When Polly was Eighteen","description":"简介： The young man, stretched on the grass among the waving shadows, was gazing across the valley to the hills in their soft afternoon veiling.
