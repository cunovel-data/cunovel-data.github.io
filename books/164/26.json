{"id":4721,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"From this time, the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people; and Catherine found, with some surprise, that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella\u0027s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother. Their persuasion that the general would, upon this ground alone, independent of the objection that might be raised against her character, oppose the connection, turned her feelings moreover with some alarm towards herself. She was as insignificant, and perhaps as portionless, as Isabella; and if the heir of the Tilney property had not grandeur and wealth enough in himself, at what point of interest were the demands of his younger brother to rest? The very painful reflections to which this thought led could only be dispersed by a dependence on the effect of that particular partiality, which, as she was given to understand by his words as well as his actions, she had from the first been so fortunate as to excite in the general; and by a recollection of some most generous and disinterested sentiments on the subject of money, which she had more than once heard him utter, and which tempted her to think his disposition in such matters misunderstood by his children. They were so fully convinced, however, that their brother would not have the courage to apply in person for his father\u0027s consent, and so repeatedly assured her that he had never in his life been less likely to come to Northanger than at the present time, that she suffered her mind to be at ease as to the necessity of any sudden removal of her own. But as it was not to be supposed that Captain Tilney, whenever he made his application, would give his father any just idea of Isabella\u0027s conduct, it occurred to her as highly expedient that Henry should lay the whole business before him as it really was, enabling the general by that means to form a cool and impartial opinion, and prepare his objections on a fairer ground than inequality of situations. She proposed it to him accordingly; but he did not catch at the measure so eagerly as she had expected. \"No,\" said he, \"my father\u0027s hands need not be strengthened, and Frederick\u0027s confession of folly need not be forestalled. He must tell his own story.\" \"But he will tell only half of it.\" \"A quarter would be enough.\" A day or two passed away and brought no tidings of Captain Tilney. His brother and sister knew not what to think. Sometimes it appeared to them as if his silence would be the natural result of the suspected engagement, and at others that it was wholly incompatible with it. The general, meanwhile, though offended every morning by Frederick\u0027s remissness in writing, was free from any real anxiety about him, and had no more pressing solicitude than that of making Miss Morland\u0027s time at Northanger pass pleasantly. He often expressed his uneasiness on this head, feared the sameness of every day\u0027s society and employments would disgust her with the place, wished the Lady Frasers had been in the country, talked every now and then of having a large party to dinner, and once or twice began even to calculate the number of young dancing people in the neighbourhood. But then it was such a dead time of year, no wild-fowl, no game, and the Lady Frasers were not in the country. And it all ended, at last, in his telling Henry one morning that when he next went to Woodston, they would take him by surprise there some day or other, and eat their mutton with him. Henry was greatly honoured and very happy, and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme. \"And when do you think, sir, I may look forward to this pleasure? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting, and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days.\" \"Well, well, we will take our chance some one of those days. There is no need to fix. You are not to put yourself at all out of your way. Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough. I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor\u0027s table. Let me see; Monday will be a busy day with you, we will not come on Monday; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me. I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning; and afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club. I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now; for, as I am known to be in the country, it would be taken exceedingly amiss; and it is a rule with me, Miss Morland, never to give offence to any of my neighbours, if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it. They are a set of very worthy men. They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year; and I dine with them whenever I can. Tuesday, therefore, we may say is out of the question. But on Wednesday, I think, Henry, you may expect us; and we shall be with you early, that we may have time to look about us. Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston, I suppose; we shall be in the carriage by ten; so, about a quarter before one on Wednesday, you may look for us.\" A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion, so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston; and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry, about an hour afterwards, came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting, and said, \"I am come, young ladies, in a very moralizing strain, to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for, and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage, giving ready-monied actual happiness for a draft on the future, that may not be honoured. Witness myself, at this present hour. Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday, which bad weather, or twenty other causes, may prevent, I must go away directly, two days before I intended it.\" \"Go away!\" said Catherine, with a very long face. \"And why?\" \"Why! How can you ask the question? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits, because I must go and prepare a dinner for you, to be sure.\" \"Oh! Not seriously!\" \"Aye, and sadly too -- for I had much rather stay.\" \"But how can you think of such a thing, after what the general said? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble, because anything would do.\" Henry only smiled. \"I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister\u0027s account and mine. You must know it to be so; and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary: besides, if he had not said half so much as he did, he has always such an excellent dinner at home, that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify.\" \"I wish I could reason like you, for his sake and my own. Good-bye. As tomorrow is Sunday, Eleanor, I shall not return.\" He went; and, it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry\u0027s, she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right, however disagreeable to her his going. But the inexplicability of the general\u0027s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts. That he was very particular in his eating, she had, by her own unassisted observation, already discovered; but why he should say one thing so positively, and mean another all the while, was most unaccountable! How were people, at that rate, to be understood? Who but Henry could have been aware of what his father was at? From Saturday to Wednesday, however, they were now to be without Henry. This was the sad finale of every reflection: and Captain Tilney\u0027s letter would certainly come in his absence; and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet. The past, present, and future were all equally in gloom. Her brother so unhappy, and her loss in Isabella so great; and Eleanor\u0027s spirits always affected by Henry\u0027s absence! What was there to interest or amuse her? She was tired of the woods and the shrubberies -- always so smooth and so dry; and the abbey in itself was no more to her now than any other house. The painful remembrance of the folly it had helped to nourish and perfect was the only emotion which could spring from a consideration of the building. What a revolution in her ideas! She, who had so longed to be in an abbey! Now, there was nothing so charming to her imagination as the unpretending comfort of a well-connected parsonage, something like Fullerton, but better: Fullerton had its faults, but Woodston probably had none. If Wednesday should ever come! It did come, and exactly when it might be reasonably looked for. It came -- it was fine -- and Catherine trod on air. By ten o\u0027clock, the chaise and four conveyed the two from the abbey; and, after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles, they entered Woodston, a large and populous village, in a situation not unpleasant. Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it, as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country, and the size of the village; but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at, and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage, and at all the little chandler\u0027s shops which they passed. At the further end of the village, and tolerably disengaged from the rest of it, stood the parsonage, a new-built substantial stone house, with its semicircular sweep and green gates; and, as they drove up to the door, Henry, with the friends of his solitude, a large Newfoundland puppy and two or three terriers, was ready to receive and make much of them. Catherine\u0027s mind was too full, as she entered the house, for her either to observe or to say a great deal; and, till called on by the general for her opinion of it, she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting. Upon looking round it then, she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world; but she was too guarded to say so, and the coldness of her praise disappointed him. \"We are not calling it a good house,\" said he. \"We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger -- we are considering it as a mere parsonage, small and confined, we allow, but decent, perhaps, and habitable; and altogether not inferior to the generality; or, in other words, I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good. It may admit of improvement, however. Far be it from me to say otherwise; and anything in reason -- a bow thrown out, perhaps -- though, between ourselves, if there is one thing more than another my aversion, it is a patched-on bow.\" Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it; and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry, at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant, the general was shortly restored to his complacency, and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits. The room in question was of a commodious, well-proportioned size, and handsomely fitted up as a dining-parlour; and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds, she was shown, first into a smaller apartment, belonging peculiarly to the master of the house, and made unusually tidy on the occasion; and afterwards into what was to be the drawing-room, with the appearance of which, though unfurnished, Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general. It was a prettily shaped room, the windows reaching to the ground, and the view from them pleasant, though only over green meadows; and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it. \"Oh! Why do not you fit up this room, Mr. Tilney? What a pity not to have it fitted up! It is the prettiest room I ever saw; it is the prettiest room in the world!\" \"I trust,\" said the general, with a most satisfied smile, \"that it will very speedily be furnished: it waits only for a lady\u0027s taste!\" \"Well, if it was my house, I should never sit anywhere else. Oh! What a sweet little cottage there is among the trees -- apple trees, too! It is the prettiest cottage!\" \"You like it -- you approve it as an object -- it is enough. Henry, remember that Robinson is spoken to about it. The cottage remains.\" Such a compliment recalled all Catherine\u0027s consciousness, and silenced her directly; and, though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings, nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her. The influence of fresh objects and fresh air, however, was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations; and, having reached the ornamental part of the premises, consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow, on which Henry\u0027s genius had begun to act about half a year ago, she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure-ground she had ever been in before, though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner. A saunter into other meadows, and through part of the village, with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements, and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about, brought them to four o\u0027clock, when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three. At four they were to dine, and at six to set off on their return. Never had any day passed so quickly! She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general; nay, that he was even looking at the side-table for cold meat which was not there. His son and daughter\u0027s observations were of a different kind. They had seldom seen him eat so heartily at any table but his own, and never before known him so little disconcerted by the melted butter\u0027s being oiled. At six o\u0027clock, the general having taken his coffee, the carriage again received them; and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations, that, could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son, Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it. 自此以后，三个年轻人时常谈论这件事。凯瑟琳惊奇地发现，她的两位年轻朋友一致认为：伊莎贝拉既没地位，又没资产，使她很难嫁给他们的哥哥。他们认为，且不说她的人格，仅凭这一点。将军就要反对这门婚事。凯瑟琳听了之后，不由得替自己惊慌起来。她像伊莎贝拉一样微不足道，也许还像她一样没有财产。如果蒂尔尼家族的财产继承人还嫌自己不够威武，不够富足，那么他的弟弟要价该有多高啊！这样一想，她觉得十分痛苦。她唯一能够感到宽慰的是，将军对她的偏爱可能会帮她的忙，因为自从认识将军那天起，她就在他的言谈举止中看出，她有幸博得了他的欢心。另外，将军对金钱的态度也使她感到宽慰。她不止一次听他说，他对金钱是慷慨无私的。回想起这些话，她觉得他对这些事情的态度，一定被他的孩子误解了。 不过，他们都深信，他们的哥哥不敢亲自来请求他父亲的同意。他们一再向她担保，他们的哥哥目前最不可能回到诺桑觉寺，这样她才算安下心，不必再去想着要突然离去。不过她又想，蒂尔尼上尉将来征求他父亲同意时，总不会把伊莎贝拉的行为如实地说出来，所以最好让亨利把整个事情原原本本地告诉将军，这样他就可以有个冷静公正的看法，准备一个正大光明的理由来拒绝他，别只说门不当户不对。于是她把这话对亨利说了，不想亨利对这个主意并不像她期望的那么热衷。“不，”亨利说，“我父亲那儿用不着火上浇油啦，弗雷德里克干的傻事用不着别人先去说，他应该自己去说。” “可他只会说一半。” “四分之一就足够了。” 一两天过去了，蒂尔尼上尉还是没有消息。他弟弟妹妹也不知道这是怎么回事。有时他们觉得，他所以没有音信是大家怀疑他已经订婚的自然结果，可是有时又觉得与那件事毫不相干。其间，将军虽然每天早晨都为弗雷德里克懒得写信感到生气，可他并不真正为他着急。他迫切关心的，倒是如何使莫兰小姐在诺桑觉寺过得快活。他时常对这方面表示不安，担心家里天天就这么几个人，事情又那么单调，会让她厌倦这个地方，希望弗雷泽斯夫人能在乡下。他还不时说起要举办大宴会，有一两次甚至统计过附近有多少能跳舞的青年。可惜眼下正是淡季，野禽猎物都没有，弗雷泽斯夫人也不在乡下。最后，他终于想出了个法子，一天早晨对亨利说，他下次再去伍德斯顿时，他们哪天来个出其不意，到他那儿一起吃顿饭。亨利感到非常荣幸，非常快活，凯瑟琳也很喜欢这个主意。“爸爸。你看我几时可以期待你光临？我星期一必须回伍德斯顿参加教区会议，大概得呆两三天。” “好吧，就趁着这几天吧，时间不必说死。你也不用添麻烦，家里有什么就吃什么。我想我可以担保，姑娘们不会挑剔光棍的饭。让我想想：星期一你很忙，我们就不去了；星期二我没空，上午我的检查员要从布罗克真翰带报告来见我，然后为了面子，我要到俱乐部去一趟。我要是现在走掉，以后就真没脸见朋友了，因为大家都知道我在乡下，走掉会惹人见怪的。莫兰小姐，我有个规矩，只要牺牲点时间、花费点精力能避免的事，我决不得罪任何邻居。他们都是很有体面的人。诺桑觉寺每年有两次要赏给他们半只鹿，我一有空就跟他们吃吃饭。所以说，星期二是去不成的。不过，亨利，我想你可以在星期三那天等我们。我们一早就到你那儿，以便有空四处看看。我想我们有两个钟头零三刻就能赶到伍德斯顿。我们十点上车，这样，你星期三那天，大约一点差一刻等我们就行了。” 凯瑟琳非常想看看伍德斯顿，觉得办舞会也不如这趟旅行有意思。约莫一个钟头以后，亨利进来的时候，她的心还高兴得扑扑直跳。亨利穿着靴子大衣，走进她和埃丽诺坐着的那间屋子，说道：“年轻小姐们，我是来进行说教的。我要说，在这个世界上，我们要得到快乐总要付出代价，时常要吃很大的亏，牺牲马上就可以兑现的真正幸福，来换取一张未来的支票，也许是张不能兑现的支票。请看我现在，因为我想星期三在伍德斯顿见到你们，所以必须立刻动身，比原定计划早两天，殊不知要是碰上天气不好，或是其他种种原因，你们就可能来不了。” “你要走，”凯瑟琳拉长了面孔说，“为什么？” “为什么？这还用问吗？因为我马上要把我的老管家吓个魂不附体。相为我当然要去给你们准备饭。” “哦！不是当真的！” “是当真的，而且还很伤心，因为我实在不想走。” “可是将军有话在先，你怎么还想这么做呢？他特别希望你不要给自己添麻烦，因为吃什么都可以。” 亨利只是笑了笑。“你千万不必为你妹妹和我准备什么，这点你一定知道。将军极力坚持不让特别准备什么。再说，即使他没有这么明说，他在家总是一直吃好的，偶尔一天吃得差些也没关系。” “但愿我能像你这样想，这对他对我都有好处。再见。明天是星期天，埃丽诺，我不回来了。” 他走了。无论什么时候，要让凯瑟琳怀疑自已的见解，总比让她怀疑亨利的见解容易得多，因此，她尽管不愿意让他走，但她很快便不得不相信，他这样做是对的。不过，她心里老是想着将军这种令人费解的行为。她经过独立观察，早就发现将军吃东西特别讲究。可他为什么总是嘴里说得如此肯定，心里却是另一套呢？真是令人莫名其妙！照这样下去，怎么才能去理解一个人呢？除了亨利，谁还能明白他父亲的用意呢？” 无论如何，从星期六到下星期三，她们是见不到亨利了。凯瑟琳不管想什么，最后总要归结到这件令人伤心的事情上。 亨利走后，蒂尔尼上尉准会来信。她敢担保，星期三一定要下雨。过去、现在和将来全都笼罩在阴影里。地哥哥如此不幸，她自己又为失掉伊莎贝拉而感到如此沉痛。亨利一走，总要影响埃丽诺的情绪！还有什么可以引起她的兴趣和乐趣呢？树林和灌木丛总是那么平整，那么干燥，她早就看腻味了。寺院本身现在对她来说，也跟别的房子没有什么区别。。想起这座房子曾经助长她、成全她去做傻事，她只能感到痛苦。她思想上起了多大的变化啊！她以前一心渴望要到寺院来。可现在却好，在她的想象里什么东西也比不上一座简朴舒适、居室方便的牧师住宅更令人神往。就像富勒顿的那样，不过要更好一些。富勒顿还有缺陷，伍德斯顿可能就没有。但愿星期三快点到来！ 星期三到来了，而且正如合理期待的那样。这天天气晴朗，凯瑟琳高兴得像驾云似的。十点钟光景那辆驷马马车载着她们两人驶出寺院，经过将近二十英里的愉快旅程之后，进入一个环境优美、人口稠密的大村子，这就是伍德斯顿。可凯瑟琳又不好意恩说她觉得这地方很美，因为将军似乎认为要对这里地势的平坦和村子的大小表示歉意。不过她从心眼里觉得这儿比她到过的任地方都好，赞羡不已地看着那些比农舍高一级的整洁住宅，和路过的一家家小杂货铺。牧师住宅位于村子尽头、与其他房子有点距离。这是一座新盖的、牢固的石头房子。还有一条半圆形的通路和绿色的大门。当马车驶到门口的时候，亨利带着他独居的伙伴，一条个子很大的纽芬兰小狗和两三条绠，正等着欢迎和好好款待他们。 凯瑟琳走进屋时，心里思绪万端，顾不上多注视、多说话，直到将军征求她对这房子的意见时，她还不知道自己坐在里面的房间是什么样子。她向四周环顾了一下之后．便立即发现这里是天下最舒适的一间屋子。不过她很谨慎，没把这个看法说出来，只是冷漠地称赏了两句，使得将军很失望。 “这不算是一座好房子，”将军说道。“它不能与富勒顿和诺桑觉寺相比。我们只是把它当作一座牧师住宅来看，房子小，不宽绰，这点我们承认。但是或许还算体面，还能住人，总的来说不比一般房子差。换句话说，我相信，英格兰没有几座乡下牧师住宅能及得上它一半好。不过，这房子也许还可以改进。我决没有不要改进的意思，只要改得合理——比如说补个凸肚窗——不过我跟你私下说，我顶讨厌的就是补上去的凸肚窗。” 这席话凯瑟琳并没全听见，所以既没搞懂它的意思，也没被它伤了感情。亨利故意说起了别的事情，并且一直说下去。同时仆人又端进满满的一盘点心，将军马上又恢复了自鸣得意的样子，凯瑟琳也和平常一样畅快起来。 这间屋子是个相当宽敞、布局匀称、装饰华丽的餐厅。出了餐厅去游览庭院时，凯瑟琳首先被带去参观一间较小的屋子，这是房主人自己的房间，这回给收拾得特别整洁。随后，大家走进未来的客厅，虽说还没装饰，凯瑟琳却很喜欢它那样子，这叫将军也为之感到满意。这是一间形状别致的屋子，窗户一直落到地上，窗外虽然只有一片绿草地，看上去却很赏心悦目。凯瑟琳很羡慕这间屋子，于是便直言不讳地表示了自己的艳羡之情。“哦！你为什么不把这间屋子装饰一下蒂尔尼先生？不装饰一下有多可惜啊！我从没见过这么漂亮的屋子，真是世界上最漂亮的屋子！” “我相信，”将军无比满意地笑笑说，“很快就会装饰起来的，就等着看它的主妇喜欢什么格调了。” “唔，假如这是我的屋子，我决不坐到别的地方。哦，树林里的那间小屋有多可爱，而且还有苹果树！这间小屋美极了——” “你喜欢它，愿意留它作窗景，这就行了。亨利，记住跟鲁宾逊说一声：小屋不拆了。” 将军的这番恭维弄得凯瑟琳非常局促，她顿时又一声不响了。虽然将军特意问她最喜欢什么颜色的墙纸和帷幔，她就是不肯说出自己的意见。但是，新鲜景物和新鲜空气帮了她的大忙，冲散了那些让人难为情的联想。来到屋子四周的装饰场地时，凯瑟琳又恢复了平静。这里有一块环绕着小路的草地，大约半年前亨利开始了天才的修整，虽然草坪上的矮树丛还没有椅角上的绿椅子高，可是凯瑟琳却觉得她从未见过这么漂亮的娱乐场地。 他们又走进其他草地，在村子里局部转了转，来到了马厩，看了看某些修缮，还和一窝非常有趣的、刚会打滚的小狗逗了一阵，不知不觉就晃到了四点，凯瑟琳还以为不到三点呢。他们准备四点钟吃饭，六点钟动身回家。没有哪一天过得这么快过！ 凯瑟琳不能不注意到，将军对这顿丰盛的晚餐似乎丝毫也不感到惊讶。不仅如此，他还眼望着旁边桌上找冻肉，结果没有找到。他的儿子和女儿看到的情况就不一样。他们发现，将军除了在自己家以外，很少有吃得这么痛快的时候。他们从没见他对涂满黄油的酥融奶酪这样满不在乎。 六点钟，将军喝完咖啡、马车又来接他们。整个访问过程中，他的举动大体上十分令人愉快，他心里的希望凯瑟琳知道得十分清楚，如果对他儿子的希望也能如此有把握的话，她离别的时候，就不至于忧虑以后如何或是何时才能重返伍德斯顿。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/308/2992.html","bookId":164,"book":{"id":164,"title":"诺桑觉寺 Northanger Abbey","description":"简介： Northanger Abbey was the first of Jane Austen\u0027s novels to be completed for publication, though she had previously made a start on Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.
