{"id":4698,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Every morning now brought its regular duties -- shops were to be visited; some new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be attended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at everybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintance in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she repeated it after every fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her knowing nobody at all. They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was more favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced to her a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his name was Tilney. He seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall, had a pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if not quite handsome, was very near it. His address was good, and Catherine felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for speaking while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being. He talked with fluency and spirit -- and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her. After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them, he suddenly addressed her with -- \"I have hitherto been very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were ever here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the theatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have been very negligent -- but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars? If you are I will begin directly.\" \"You need not give yourself that trouble, sir.\" \"No trouble, I assure you, madam.\" Then forming his features into a set smile, and affectedly softening his voice, he added, with a simpering air, \"Have you been long in Bath, madam?\" \"About a week, sir,\" replied Catherine, trying not to laugh. \"Really!\" with affected astonishment. \"Why should you be surprised, sir?\" \"Why, indeed!\" said he, in his natural tone. \"But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed, and not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you never here before, madam?\" \"Never, sir.\" \"Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?\" \"Yes, sir, I was there last Monday.\" \"Have you been to the theatre?\" \"Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday.\" \"To the concert?\" \"Yes, sir, on Wednesday.\" \"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?\" \"Yes -- I like it very well.\" \"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.\" Catherine turned away her head, not knowing whether she might venture to laugh. \"I see what you think of me,\" said he gravely -- \"I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.\" \"My journal!\" \"Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings -- plain black shoes -- appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him, and distressed me by his nonsense.\" \"Indeed I shall say no such thing.\" \"Shall I tell you what you ought to say?\" \"If you please.\" \"I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had a great deal of conversation with him -- seems a most extraordinary genius -- hope I may know more of him. That, madam, is what I wish you to say.\" \"But, perhaps, I keep no journal.\" \"Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by you. These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a journal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every evening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered, and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse to a journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies\u0027 ways as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done something, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal.\" \"I have sometimes thought,\" said Catherine, doubtingly, \"whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is -- I should not think the superiority was always on our side.\" \"As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three particulars.\" \"And what are they?\" \"A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a very frequent ignorance of grammar.\" \"Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way.\" \"I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better landscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation, excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes.\" They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: \"My dear Catherine,\" said she, \"do take this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already; I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though it cost but nine shillings a yard.\" \"That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,\" said Mr. Tilney, looking at the muslin. \"Do you understand muslins, sir?\" \"Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be an excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown. I bought one for her the other day, and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five shillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.\" Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his genius. \"Men commonly take so little notice of those things,\" said she; \"I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your sister, sir.\" \"I hope I am, madam.\" \"And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland\u0027s gown?\" \"It is very pretty, madam,\" said he, gravely examining it; \"but I do not think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray.\" \"How can you,\" said Catherine, laughing, \"be so -- \" She had almost said \"strange.\" \"I am quite of your opinion, sir,\" replied Mrs. Allen; \"and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it.\" \"But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or other; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a cap, or a cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my sister say so forty times, when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces.\" \"Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We are sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury, but it is so far to go -- eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen says it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than eight; and it is such a fag -- I come back tired to death. Now, here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes.\" Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she said; and she kept him on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced. Catherine feared, as she listened to their discourse, that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others. \"What are you thinking of so earnestly?\" said he, as they walked back to the ballroom; \"not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head, your meditations are not satisfactory.\" Catherine coloured, and said, \"I was not thinking of anything.\" \"That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me.\" \"Well then, I will not.\" \"Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much.\" They danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the lady\u0027s side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the acquaintance. Whether she thought of him so much, while she drank her warm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him when there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman\u0027s love is declared,* it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her. How proper Mr. Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr. Allen\u0027s head, but that he was not objectionable as a common acquaintance for his young charge he was on inquiry satisfied; for he had early in the evening taken pains to know who her partner was, and had been assured of Mr. Tilney\u0027s being a clergyman, and of a very respectable family in Gloucestershire. 现在，每天上午都有些固定的事情要做：逛逛商店，游览游览城内的一些新鲜地方，到矿泉厅转悠个把钟头，看看这个人望望那个人，可是跟谁也搭不上话。艾伦太太仍然热切希望她在巴思能有许多熟人，但当每天上午都证明她压根儿不认识任何人时，她便要重新絮叨一遍这个希望。 她们来到了下舞厅。在这里，我们的女主角还比较幸运。典礼官给她介绍了一位很有绅士派头的年轻人作舞伴。他姓蒂尔尼，约莫有二十四五岁的样子，身材高大，面孔和悦，两只眼睛炯炯有神，如果说还不十分漂亮，那也差不多。他谈吐优雅，凯瑟琳觉得自己非常走运。他们跳舞的时候、顾不上说话。但是坐下喝茶的时候，凯瑟琳发现蒂尔尼先生就像她料想的那样，非常和蔼可亲。他口齿伶俐，谈笑风生。谈吐中带有几分调皮与诙谐，凯瑟琳虽然难以领会，但却很感兴趣。周围的事物自然成为他们的话题，谈了一阵之后，蒂尔尼先生突然对她说道：“小姐，我这个舞伴实在有些失礼，还没有请教你来巴思多久了。以前来过这儿没有，是否会过上舞厅、剧院和音乐厅，是不是很喜欢这个地方。我太疏忽了——不过。不知道你现在是否有空来回答这些问题？你若是有空，我马上就开始请教。” “先生，你不必给自己添麻烦了” “不麻烦，小姐，你尽管放心。”接着，他做出一副笑脸，装作柔声细气地问道： “你在巴思呆了很久了吧，小姐？” “大约一个星期，先生，”凯瑟琳答道，尽量忍住笑。 “真的！” 蒂尔尼先生假装大吃一惊。 “你为什么惊讶，先生？” “为什么惊讶？”蒂尔尼用自然的口气说道，“你的回答似乎总要激起某种感应，而惊讶最容易作出来，也最合乎情理。好啦，我们接着往下说吧。你以前来来这里吗。小姐？” “从来没有，先生。” “真的！光临过上舞厅吗？” “去过，先生。上个星期一去过。” “上过戏院吗？” “上过，先生。星期二看过戏。” “听过音乐会吗？” “听过，先生。在星期三。” “很喜欢巴思吗？” “是的，很喜欢。” “说到这儿，我得傻笑一声，然后我们再恢复理智。” 凯瑟琳别过头去，不知道是否可以贸然一笑。 “我知道你是怎么看我的，”蒂尔尼一本正经地说道，“明天，我在你的日记里要露出一付可怜相了。” “我的日记？” “是的。我确切地知道你要说什么：‘星期五，去下舞厅。身着带枝叶花纹的，镶蓝边的纱裙，脚穿素黑鞋，显得非常漂亮，不过奇怪得很，被一个傻里傻气的怪家伙缠扰了半天，硬要我陪她跳舞，听他胡说八道。” “我才不会这样说呢。” “要我先找你该怎么说吗？” “请讲。” “经金先生介绍，与一位十分可爱的小伙子跳舞。同他说了很多话。仿佛是个非凡的天才，希望进一步了解地。小姐，这就是我希望你要说的话。” “不过，兴许我不写日记呢。” “兴许你不坐在这屋里，兴许我不坐在你身边。这两点也同样可以引起怀疑吧。不写日记！那你别处的表姊妹如何了解你在巴思的生活情况？每天有那么多的寒暄问候，要是晚上不记到日记里，怎么能如实地向人讲述呢？要是不经常参看日记，你怎么能记住你那些各式各样的衣服，怎么能向人描绘你那种种的肤色特征、种种的卷发样式？亲爱的小姐，我对年轻小姐的特点，并不像你想象的那样一无所知。女人一般都以文笔流畅著称，这在很大程度上归功于记日记的良好习惯。众所公认，能写出令人赏心悦目的书信，这是女人特有的才具。天性固然起一定的作用，但是我敢断定、主要还是受益于多写日记。” “我有时在想，”凯瑟琳怀疑地说，“女人写信是否真比男人写得好。也就是说，我并不认为我们总比男人高明。” “就我见过的来说，女人的写信风格除了三点以外，通常都是完美无缺的。” “哪三点？” “普遍空洞无物，完全忽视标点，经常不懂文法。” “老实说，我刚才不必担心拒绝了你的恭维。照这么看，你并非把我们看得很高明。” “我不能一概而论地认为女人写信比男人写得好，就像不能一概认为女人唱二重唱比男人唱得好，画风景画比男人画得好一样。在以情趣为基础的各项能力上，男女双方是同样杰出的。” 两人正说着，不想让艾伦太太给打断了。“亲爱的凯瑟琳，”她说，“快把我袖子上的别针给摘下来。恐怕把袖子扯了个洞吧。要是真扯了个洞，那就太可惜了。因为这是我最喜爱的一件长裙，尽管一码布只花九先令。” “我估计的也正是这个价钱，太太，”蒂尔尼先生边说，边瞧着那细纱布。 “你也懂得细纱布吗，先生？” “在行极了。我总是亲自买自己的领带，谁都承认我是个杰出的行家。我妹妹还经常托我替她选购长裙呢。几天前，我替她买了一件，女士们见了个个都说便宜极了。一码才花五先令，而且是货真价实的印度细洋纱。” 艾伦太太十分惊羡他的天赋。“男人一般很少留心这类事情，”她说。“我从来无法让艾伦先生把我的一件长裙同另一件区分开。你一定使你妹妹很满意吧、先生。” “但愿如此，太太。” “请问，先生，你觉得莫兰小姐的长裙怎么样？” “倒是很漂亮，太太，”他说，一面郑重其事地审视着。“不过，我看这料子不经洗。恐怕容易破。” “你怎么能这么——”凯瑟琳笑着说道，差一点没说出“怪诞”两个字。。 “我完全赞成你的意见，先生，”艾伦太太应道。“莫兰小姐买的时候，我就对她这么说过。” “不过你知道，太太，细纱布总可以改派别的用场。莫兰小姐完全可以用它来做一块手帕。一顶软帽或是一件斗篷。细纱布可以说从来不会浪费的。我妹妹每当大手大脚地把布买多了，或者漫不经心地把布剪坏了，就要念叨细纱布浪费了，我已经听见几十次了。” “先生，巴思可真是个迷人的地方，有那么多好商店，我们不幸住在乡下。索尔兹伯里倒是有几个很好的商店，但是路太远了。八英里是够远的了。艾伦先生说是九英里，标准的九英里。可是我敢肯定，不会超过八英里。跑一趟真苦啊，我回来的时候都给累趴了。再看这儿，你一走出门，五分钟就能买到东西。” 蒂尔尼先生倒比较客气，似乎对她说的话还挺感兴趣的。艾伦太太抓住细纱布这个话题．同他谈个不停，直到跳舞重新开始。 凯瑟琳听着他们的谈话，心里不禁有些担忧，觉得蒂尔尼先生有点过于喜欢讥诮别人的缺点。“你在聚精会神地寻思什么？”他们走回舞厅时，蒂尔尼先生问道。“我想不是在想你的舞伴吧，因为从你的摇头可以看出，你沉思的事情不尽令你满意。” 凯瑟琳脸上一红，说道：“我什么也没想。” “你回答得很委婉很深奥啊。不过，我倒宁可听你直截了当地说，你不愿意告诉我。” “那好吧，我不愿意。” “谢谢你。我们马上就要成为好朋友了，因为以后一见面，我都有权利拿这件事来和你开玩笑，开玩笑最容易促进友谊。” 他们又跳起舞来。舞会结束后．双方分手了。就女方来说，她至少是很愿意继续交往的。她喝着温热的搀水葡萄酒，准备上床的时候，是否还一个劲地想着他，以至于入睡后还梦见他，这就不得而知了。不过我希望，她只不过是昏昏欲睡中梦见他，或者充其量只是在早晨打盹时梦见他。有位名作家认为，男的没有向女的表露钟情之前，女人不应当爱上男的。 假如确实如此，那么一个年轻小姐在尚不知道男方是否先梦见她之前，居然就先梦起男的来，那当然是很不得体的事。但是，蒂尔尼先生作为一个梦中人或情人究竟如何得体，艾伦先生也许还没考虑过。不过。他经过打听，并不反对蒂尔尼同他的年轻保护人交个普通朋友，因为当天傍晚他就费心调查了凯瑟琳舞伴的情况，结果了解到：蒂尔尼先生是个牧师，出生在格洛斯特郡的一户体面人。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/308/2969.html","bookId":164,"book":{"id":164,"title":"诺桑觉寺 Northanger Abbey","description":"简介： Northanger Abbey was the first of Jane Austen\u0027s novels to be completed for publication, though she had previously made a start on Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.
