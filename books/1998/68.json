Jake Wethers, sexy, tattooed and deliciously bad lead singer, and brains behind The Mighty Storm, one of the biggest bands in the world, left Tru with a broken heart when he moved from England to America with his family when they were both fourteen. Sent to interview Jake for her music column by the magazine she works for, they are both unprepared for the sparks that fly the instant they reconnect. Only, there’s a complication to their instant feelings for one another—Will, Tru’s boyfriend of two years. Then Jake makes Tru a job offer she can\u0027t refuse—travelling the world with him and his band. But taking the job means leaving Will behind, and being on the road with the band means spending an inordinate amount of time with Jake. Is Tru strong enough to resist the delectable bad boy who once held her heart so completely, or will she willingly risk it all for one night with the world\u0027s most notorious womanizer?","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1.jpg","author":"Samantha Towle","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:13 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:29:01 PM"}}
