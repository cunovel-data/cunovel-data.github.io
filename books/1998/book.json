Only, there’s a complication to their instant feelings for one another—Will, Tru’s boyfriend of two years. \n Then Jake makes Tru a job offer she can\u0027t refuse—travelling the world with him and his band. But taking the job means leaving Will behind, and being on the road with the band means spending an inordinate amount of time with Jake. \n Is Tru strong enough to resist the delectable bad boy who once held her heart so completely, or will she willingly risk it all for one night with the world\u0027s most notorious womanizer?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1.jpg","author":"Samantha Towle","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":68,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
