Of course I’d never tell her that, she’d have my hide if I did.\n My eyes scan around for a price for the ring, but there isn’t one, which means it’s ridiculously expensive.\n Like I could have ever afforded it anyway. I can’t even afford moderately priced Tiffany’s. Not even cheap Tiffany’s, if there is such a thing.\n That ring will be worth more than I can earn in a lifetime.\n “See anything you like?” Jake says in a husky voice from behind me.\n Without thinking, I say in my still dreamy state, “Look at that ring, it’s so beautiful,” pointing my finger to it.\n Then I realise, smack bang, how it will look to Jake that I’m standing here, gazing dreamy eyed at pink diamond rings, which actually looks a lot like an engagement ring, and I’m pointing said ring out to him, in a dreamy sounding voice.\n I’m such a girl at times.\n “Um … I mean it’s nice, you know, as rings go … so did you get what you came for?” I ask, abruptly changing the subject.\n I turn away from the dream ring to face him.\n “I did.” He pats his jacket pocket looking pretty happy with himself.\n Jake looks absolutely delicious tonight. And very smart. He’s dressed in blue jeans, but he’s wearing a shirt and a suit jacket with them. It shouldn’t work but it does on him, and he looks so very hot.\n I’m wearing my sleeveless, floral print dress. It’s fitted at the waist, and has a cut out back. It’s pretty, with a real sexiness about it. I’ve teamed it with my cream heels. And my hair is down and curly, just as Jake likes it.\n He takes hold of my hand and opening the door for me, I exit first, leaving Tiffany’s.\n “Bye sparkly,” I murmur quietly to myself.\n “What did you say?” Jake asks.\n “Um … what? Nothing.” My face flushes scarlet, and I quick march to the car, leaving Jake to chuckle softly behind me.\n I’ve just got in the car and put my seatbelt on, when I turn to Jake, wondering why he hasn’t started the car yet and see a Tiffany’s box sitting on the armrest separating me and him.\n My heart does a little dance in my chest.\n I look from the box to him.\n “I got you a little something,” he says, looking, surprisingly nervous.\n “Is that what you went in there to pick up?”\n “Uh huh,” he nods.\n “What is it?” My insides are doing cartwheels at the moment, but I’m keeping a poker face on. I don’t want to come across as the girlie idiot I truly am.\n He smiles, chuckling lightly. “Open it and find out.”\n I reach forward and pick the box up. Cracking it open, I find inside the most beautiful necklace I’ve ever seen. Ever.\n It’s a platinum heart locket pendant, with a heart shaped diamond set in the centre.\n I can’t believe he bought me this. I think I may actually cry.\n “It’s so beautiful, Jake,” I breathe.\n “Open it up,” he points his chin at the locket.\n I remove the locket from the box, putting it back down on the armrest. Then using my fingernail, I pop the locket open.\n I gasp. The smile on my face has just reached maximum size.\n “Your dad sent me the picture,” he says, looking shy. I love shy Jake. “The other is from the after show party in Sweden.”\n Printed inside the locket are two pictures of Jake and I. One from when we were toddlers. We must be three years old max, and the other is from the after show party in Sweden like he said.\n Overcome with emotion, I launch myself at him. Kissing him hard and passionately on the mouth, knotting my fingers into his hair, holding him to me. Jake kisses me back as equally passionate, his hand cupped around the back of my neck, holding me to him, his tongue roaming my mouth, moving with mine.\n “So you like it then?” he whispers into my mouth as our kissing slows.\n “I love it, and I love you.”\n “Birthday present number three,” he murmurs, brushing my hair back off my face.\n “I’m still yet to get you anything.”\n “I got all my twelve the moment you agreed to be mine.”\n “Who knew you were such a hopeless romantic, Jake Wethers.” Smiling, I trace my fingertip over his lips. The light bruise from his fight with Will still evident there.\n It’s crazy to believe that was only yesterday morning. It feels like we’ve done so much together since then.\n “Only with you I am. And I’m also horny twenty-four-seven.” He runs his hand up my thigh, pushing the hem of my dress up with his fingers.\n “Again?” I say.\n “Always.”\n “Well we’re not doing it here, in the car on the street, Pervy Perverson.”\n “Pervy Perverson?” Jake splutters out a laugh.\n “Friends – you never watched?” I say at his puzzled expression.\n “No, dork, I was too busy touring and earning a living, while you were bumming around at uni watching soaps.”\n “Shut your face, and put my necklace on PP,” I grin at him.\n Jake holds his hand out for the necklace, so I place it in his palm.\n I turn away from him, moving my long hair away from my neck.\n Jake places the cool metal around my neck, and catches the fastener at the back. His hands linger on my shoulders, and then I feel the touch of his warm lips on the nape of my neck.\n It sends shivers running down my spine.\n I reach my hand back, touching his thigh, and lean myself into him.\n He smells and feels amazing, and a heat starts to rise in my body, pooling in my belly. And now I’m turned on.\n I start to inch my fingers up his thigh.\n Jake catches hold of my hand. “We’re not doing it here, MP.”\n “MP?” I turn, looking at him puzzled.\n “Mrs Perverson,” he smirks, then leaving me cold, he starts the car, puts his belt on and pulls out into the road.\n Mrs? Hmm… I’m liking the sound of that.\n Mrs. Trudy Wethers.\n Has quite a ring to it if you ask me. Not now of course. But then Jake’s not exactly the marrying kind is he.\n The thought makes me feel a little sad.\n “Where to now?” I ask, ignoring my own crashing wedding bells, and instead try to poker some info out of him.\n “Now it’s time birthday present number four.”\n Jake pulls the car up on the main road, a stretch away from the Eiffel Tour. It is a little busier around here of course. Tourists are all around.\n Out of my window, I see a young guy waiting by the roadside, and I instantly know he’s here waiting for us.\n “Come on, baby,” Jake says climbing out of the car.\n By the time I’m out of the car, the star-struck young guy is taking the car keys from Jake and is walking around to the driver’s side with a huge smile on his face.\n “You didn’t just give the car to a random stranger did you?” I ask, smirking.\n “No,” he chuckles, gently swotting my behind with his hand. “He works for the place we’re going to. He’s going to go park the car for us … he’ll probably joy ride it first – can\u0027t say I blame him because I would if I was him – but as long as it’s back for when we need it, I’m cool.”\n “Aww, you’re so sweet, baby, letting the teenager go for a joyride in the hire car.” I nudge him with my hip. “And you’re also silly, romantic, and looking very hot tonight.”\n “Yeah?” He turns to me, that lusty Jake fire in his eyes again. “And you’re beautiful and insanely sexy, and right now I want to peel that dress off you and do dirty things to you right here and now in the street, but I think we might get arrested if I do.”\n I press my legs together, trying to control the tremble in them he’s just created with his words.\n “Later?”\n “Oh, most definitely,” he nods. “Now come on, beautiful, let’s get moving before I starting getting stopped for autographs.” He does a quick, comical glance around, then holds his arm out for me to take.\n I link my arm through his, boxing up my sudden urges for later, and we start to walk down the Parisian street together just like any other normal couple, heading in the direction of the Eiffel Tower.\n I feel relaxed and happy, and not at all worried that we’re going to get mobbed by TMS fans.\n If people are looking at us, I don’t even notice, because I’m too busy staring at Jake, drinking him in.\n “What?” he asks, staring down at me.\n “Nothing. I’m just happy.” I rest my head against his shoulder as we walk.\n “Me too,” he murmurs, kissing the top of my head.\n As we near the Eiffel Tower, I look up, and get a feeling of vertigo from the sheer height of it.\n “Wow, it’s so amazing,” I murmur.\n “Yeah, it’s pretty cool, isn’t it,” Jake says, following my gaze skywards.\n “Have you ever been here before?” I ask.\n “No.”\n “But you’ve been to Paris?” I haven’t. It’s my first time here. I’ve always been more of an Ibiza girl.\n “Yeah, I’ve been quite a few times,” he replies.\n “So why have you never visited here, or the Louvre come to think of it?”\n “Because I was saving them for you.”\n “What?” I stop walking. We’re just under the tower now.\n Jake turns to face me, sliding his arms around my waist, pulling me close.\n “I knew one day I would eventually see you again, and I knew when that day came I wasn’t letting you go for anything. And these were the things I wanted to do with you when I had you back. No one else, just you.”\n “So you were waiting for me?”\n “Yes.”\n Holy fuck.\n “And what if fate had decided we were never to be?”\n “Then there would never have been anyone else. There is no one else for me. Only you.”\n Just when I think he can’t get any sweeter, he goes and says something to top his last heavenly saccharin.\n I reach up on my tiptoes and kiss his cheek.\n “I’m never letting you go,” he whispers, as my lips touch his skin.\n “I don’t want you to. Ever.”\n I spy over Jake’s shoulder a guy, an older guy, loitering by a doorway at the bottom of the tower.\n “I think one of your staff is waiting for you.”\n Jake glances over his shoulder and signals two minutes to the guy.\n He nods and steps back just inside the door.\n “He’s not my staff, smart ass,” he says slapping my behind. “Just hired for the night.”\n “I hope I’m not just a hire for the night?” I press my lips together, holding back my smile.\n “Depends on what you have to offer?” He raises an eyebrow, giving me his, fuck-me-now stare.\n “J-Jake Wethers – are you Jake Wethers?” comes a young sounding voice to our right. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-mighty-storm-the-storm-1/page-46.html","bookId":1998,"book":{"id":1998,"title":"The Mighty Storm (The Storm #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Mighty Storm (The Storm #1) \n It\u0027s been twelve years since Tru Bennett last saw Jake Wethers, her former best friend and boy she once loved. \n Jake Wethers, sexy, tattooed and deliciously bad lead singer, and brains behind The Mighty Storm, one of the biggest bands in the world, left Tru with a broken heart when he moved from England to America with his family when they were both fourteen. \n Sent to interview Jake for her music column by the magazine she works for, they are both unprepared for the sparks that fly the instant they reconnect.
