It was a clear day; the first all week. A perfect day for driving. It was Jeremiah\u0027s day off, and I couldn\u0027t believe he was willing to spend it teaching me how to drive stick. I\u0027d been begging him since last year to teach me--Steven had tried and had given up after our third lesson.\\n\\n Steven shook his head and took a swig of orange juice from the carton on the table. \"Do you want to die, man? Because Belly will kill you both, not to mention your clutch. Don\u0027t do it. I\u0027m telling you this as your friend.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Steven!\" I yelled, kicking him under the table. \"Just \u0027cause you\u0027re a terrible teacher ...\" Steven had refused to get into a car with me again after I\u0027d accidentally gotten a teeny-tiny dent in his fender when he was teaching me how to parallel park.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m confident in my teaching skills,\" Jeremiah said. \"By the time I\u0027m finished with her, she\u0027ll be better than you.\\n\\n Steven snorted. \"Good luck. \"Then he frowned. \"How long are you gonna be gone? I thought we were going to the driving range.\"\\n\\n \"You could come with us,\" I offered.\\n\\n Steven ignored me and said to Jeremiah, \"You need to practice your swing, dude.\"\\n\\n I glanced at Jeremiah, who looked at me and hesitated. \"I\u0027ll be back by lunch. We can go after,\" he said.\\n\\n Steven rolled his eyes. \"Fine.\" I could tell he was annoyed and a little hurt, which made me feel both smug and sorry for him. He wasn\u0027t used to being left out of things the way I was.\\n\\n We went out to practice on the road that led down to the other side of the beach. It was quiet. There was no one else out on the road, just us. We listened to Jeremiah\u0027s old Nevermind CD from a million years ago.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hot when a girl can drive stick,\" Jeremiah explained above Kurt Cobain. \"It shows she\u0027s confident, she knows what she\u0027s doing.\"\\n\\n I put the car into first gear and eased my foot off the clutch. \"I thought boys liked it when girls were helpless.\"\\n\\n \"They like that too. But I just happen to prefer smart, confident girls.\"\\n\\n \"Bull. You liked Taylor, and she\u0027s not like that.\"\\n\\n He groaned and stuck his arm out the window. \"Do you have to bring that up again?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just saying. She wasn\u0027t that smart and confident.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe not, but she definitely knew what she was doing,\" he said, before exploding into laughter.\\n\\n I hit him on the arm, hard. \"You\u0027re so gross,\" I said. \"And you\u0027re also a liar. I know for a fact that you guys didn\u0027t even get to second.\"\\n\\n He stopped laughing. \"Okay, fine. We didn\u0027t. But she was a good kisser. She tasted like Skittles.\"\\n\\n Taylor loved Skittles. She was always popping them into her mouth, like vitamins, like they were good for her. I wondered how I\u0027d stacked up against Taylor, if he thought I\u0027d been a good kisser too.\\n\\n I sneaked a peek at him, and he must have seen it on my face, because he laughed and said, \"But you, you were the best, Bells.\"\\n\\n I punched him on the arm, and even then he didn\u0027t stop laughing. He just laughed harder. \"Don\u0027t take your foot off the clutch,\" he said, gasping with laughter.\\n\\n I was kind of surprised he even remembered. I mean, it had been memorable for me, but it had been my first kiss and it had been Jeremiah. But the fact that he remembered, that sort of made his laughing okay.\\n\\n \"You were my first kiss,\" I said. I felt like I could say anything to him at that moment. It felt like how it used to be with us before we grew up and things got complicated. It felt easy and friendly and normal.\\n\\n He looked away, embarrassed. \"Yeah, I know.\"\\n\\n \"How did you know?\" I demanded. Had I been that awful at kissing that he\u0027d suspected? How humiliating.\\n\\n \"Um, Taylor told me. Afterward.\"\\n\\n \"What! I can\u0027t believe she did that. That Judas!\" I almost stopped the car. Actually, I could believe it. But it still felt like a betrayal.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no big deal.\" But his cheeks were patchy and pink. \"I mean, the first time I kissed a girl was a joke. She kept telling me I was doing it wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Who? Who was your first kiss?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know her. It doesn\u0027t matter.\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" I wheedled. \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n We stalled out then, and Jeremiah said, \"Just put your foot on the clutch and put it in neutral.\"\\n\\n \"Not until you tell me.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. It was Christi Turnduck,\" he said, ducking his head.\\n\\n \"You kissed Turducken?\" Now I was laughing. I did so know Christi Turnduck. She used to be a Cousins Beach regular just like us, only she lived there year round.\\n\\n \"She had a big crush on me,\" Jeremiah said, shrugging his shoulders. .\\n\\n \"Did you tell Con and Steven?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, no, I didn\u0027t tell them I kissed Turducken!\" he said. \"And you better not either! Pinky promise.\"\\n\\n I offered him my pinky, and we shook on it.\\n\\n \"Christi Turnduck. She did kiss nice. She taught me everything I know. I wonder what ever happened to her.\"\\n\\n I wondered if Turducken had been a better kisser than me too. She must have been, if she had taught Jeremiah.\\n\\n We stalled out again. \"This sucks. I quit.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no quitting in driving,\" Jeremiah ordered. Come on.\\n\\n I sighed and started the car up again. Two hours later, I had it. Sort of. I still stalled out, but I was getting somewhere. I was driving. Jeremiah said I was a natural.\\n\\n By the time we got back to the house, it was after four and Steven had left. I guessed he\u0027d gotten tired of waiting and had gone to the driving range by himself. My mother and Susannah were watching old movies in Susannah\u0027s room. It was dark, and they had the curtains drawn.\\n\\n I stood outside their door a minute, listening to them laugh. I felt left out. I envied their relationship. They were exactly like copilots, in perfect balance. I didn\u0027t have that kind of friendship, the forever kind of friendship that will last your whole life through, no matter what.\\n\\n I walked into the room, and Susannah said, \"Belly! Come watch movies with us.\"\\n\\n I crawled into bed in between the two of them. Lying on the bed in the semi-dark, it felt cozy, like we were in a cave. \"Jeremiah\u0027s been teaching me how to drive,\" I told them.\\n\\n \"Darling boy,\" Susannah said, smiling faintly.\\n\\n \"Brave, too,\" my mother said. She tweaked my nose.\\n\\n I snuggled under the comforter. He was pretty great. It had been nice of him to take me out driving when no one else would. Just because I\u0027d banged up the car a few times, it didn\u0027t mean that I wasn\u0027t going to end up being an excellent driver like everyone else. Thanks to him, I could drive stick now. I was going to be one of those confident girls, the kind who knows what she\u0027s doing. When I got my license, I would drive up to Susannah\u0027s house and take Jeremiah for a drive, to thank him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-14.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
