{"id":78902,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Susannah was always calling us children, but the thing was, I didn\u0027t even mind. Normally I would. But the way Susannah said it, it didn\u0027t seem like a bad thing, not like we were small and babyish. Instead it sounded like we had our whole lives in front of us.\\n\\n Chapter twelve\\n\\n Mr. Fisher would pop in throughout the summer, an occasional weekend and always the first week of August. He was a banker, and getting away for any real length of time was, according to him, simply impossible. And anyway, it was better without him there, when it was just us. When Mr. Fisher came to town, which wasn\u0027t very often, I stood up a little straighter. Everyone did. Well, except Susannah and my mother, of course. The funny thing was, my mother had known Mr. Fisher for as long as Susannah had--the three of them had gone to college together, and their school was small.\\n\\n Susannah always told me to call Mr. Fisher \"Adam,\" but I could never do it. It just didn\u0027t sound right. Mr. Fisher was what sounded right, so that\u0027s what I called him, and that\u0027s what Steven called him too. I think something about him inspired people to call him that, and not just kids, either. I think he preferred it that way.\\n\\n He\u0027d arrive at dinnertime on Friday night, and we\u0027d wait for him. Susannah would fix his favorite drink and have it ready, ginger and Maker\u0027s Mark. My mother teased her for waiting on him, but Susannah didn\u0027t mind. My mother teased Mr. Fisher, too, in fact. He teased her right back. Maybe teasing isn\u0027t the right word. It was more like bickering. They bickered a lot, but they smiled, too. It was funny: My mother and father had rarely argued, but they hadn\u0027t smiled that much either.\\n\\n I guess Mr. Fisher was good-looking, for a dad. He was better-looking than my father anyway, but he was also vainer than him. I don\u0027t know that he was as good-looking as Susannah was beautiful, but that might\u0027ve just been because I loved Susannah more than almost anyone, and who could ever measure up to a person like that? Sometimes it\u0027s like people are a million times more beautiful to you in your mind. It\u0027s like you see them through a special lens--but maybe if it\u0027s how you see them, that\u0027s how they really are. It\u0027s like the whole tree falling in the forest thing.\\n\\n Mr. Fisher gave us kids a twenty anytime we went anywhere. Conrad was always in charge of it. \"For ice cream,\" he\u0027d say. \"Buy yourselves something sweet.\" Something sweet. It was always something sweet. Conrad worshipped him. His dad was his hero. For a long time, anyway. Longer than most people. I think my dad stopped being my hero when I saw him with one of his PhD students after he and my mother separated. She wasn\u0027t even pretty.\\n\\n It would be easy to blame my dad for the whole thing--the divorce, the new apartment. But if I blamed anyone, it was my mother. Why did she have to be so calm, so placid? At least my father cried. At least he was in pain. My mother said nothing, revealed nothing. Our family broke up, and she just went on. It wasn\u0027t right.\\n\\n When we got home from the beach that summer, my dad had already moved out--his first-edition Heming ways, his chess set, his Billy Joel CDs, Claude. Claude was his cat, and he belonged to my dad in a way that he didn\u0027t to anyone else. It was only right that he took Claude. Still, I was sad. In a way, Claude being gone was almost worse than my dad, because Claude was so permanent in the way he lived in our house, the way he inhabited every single space. It was like he owned the place.\\n\\n My dad took me out for lunch to Applebee\u0027s, and he said, apologetically, \"I\u0027m sorry I took Claude. Do you miss him?\" He had Russian dressing on his beard, newly grown out, for most of the lunch. It was annoying. The beard was annoying; the lunch was annoying.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t look up from my French onion soup. \"He\u0027s yours anyway.\"\\n\\n So my father got Claude, and my mother got Steven and me. It worked out for everyone. We saw my father most weekends. We\u0027d stay at his new apartment that smelled like mildew, no matter how much incense he lit.\\n\\n I hated incense, and so did my mother. It made me sneeze. I think it made my father feel independent and exotic to light all the incense he wanted, in his new pad, as he called it. As soon as I walked into the apartment, I said accusingly, \"Have you been lighting incense in here?\" Had he forgotten about my allergy already?\\n\\n Guiltily, my father admitted that yes, he had lit some; incense, but he wouldn\u0027t do it anymore. He still did, though. He did it when I wasn\u0027t there, out the window, but I could still smell the stuff.\\n\\n It was a two-bedroom apartment; he slept in the master bedroom, and I slept in the other one in a little twin bed with pink sheets. My brother slept on the pullout couch. Which, I was actually jealous of, because he got to stay up watching TV. All my room had was a bed and a white dresser set that I barely even used. Only one drawer had clothes in it. The rest were empty. There was a bookshelf too, with books my father had bought for me. My father was always buying me books. He kept hoping I\u0027d turn out smart like him, someone who loved words, loved to read. I did like to read, but not the way he wanted me to. Not in the way of being, like, a scholar. I liked novels, not nonfiction. And I hated those scratchy pink sheets. If he had asked me, I would have told him yellow, not pink.\\n\\n He did try, though. In his own way, he tried. He bought a secondhand piano and crammed it into the dining room, just for me. So I could still practice even when I stayed over there, he said. I hardly did, though-- the piano was out of tune, and I never had the heart to tell him.\\n\\n It\u0027s part of why I longed for summer. It meant I didn\u0027t have to stay at my father\u0027s sad little apartment. It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t like seeing him: I did. I missed him so much. But that apartment, it was depressing. I wished I could see him at our house. Our real house. I wished it could be like it used to be. And since my mother had us most of the summer, he took Steven and me on a trip when we got back. Usually it was to Florida to see our grandmother. We called her Granna. It was a depressing trip too--Granna spent the whole time trying to convince him to get back together with my mother, whom she adored. \"Have you talked with Laurel lately?\" she\u0027d ask, even way long after the divorce.\\n\\n I hated hearing her nag him about it; it wasn\u0027t like it was in his control anyway. It was humiliating, because it was my mother who had split up with him. It was she who had precipitated the divorce, had pushed the whole thing, I knew that much for sure. My father would have been perfectly content carrying on, living in our blue two-story with Claude and all his books. My dad once told me that Winston Churchill said that Russia was a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma. According to my dad, Churchill had been talking about my mother. This was before the divorce, and he said it half-bitterly, half-respectfully. Because even when he hated her, he admired her. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-8.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
