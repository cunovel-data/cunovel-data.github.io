We sat and watched stiffly. Everyone else busted up laughing at the part when Jack stands at the helm and says, \"I\u0027m the king of the world.\" I was silent. About midway through, Nicole whispered something into Conrad\u0027s ear, and the two of them stood up. \"See you guys later,\" Conrad said. As soon as they were gone, I hissed, \"They\u0027re so disgusting. They probably went upstairs to go at it.\" \"Go at it? Who says \u0027go at it\u0027?\" Cam said, bemused. \"Shut up. Don\u0027t you think she was gross?\" \"Gross? No. I think she\u0027s cute. A little too much bronzer, maybe.\" I laughed in spite of myself. \"Bronzer? What do you know about bronzer?\" \"I have an older sister, remember,\" he said, smiling self-consciously. \"She likes makeup. We share a bathroom.\" I didn\u0027t remember Cam saying he had a sister. \"Well, anyway, she does wear too much bronzer. She\u0027s bright orange! I wonder where her Red Sox hat is,\" I mused. Cam picked up the remote control and paused the movie. \"Why are you so obsessed with her?\" \"I\u0027m not obsessed with her. Why would I be obsessed with her? She has no personality. She\u0027s like one of those pod people. She looks at Conrad like he\u0027s God.\" I knew he was judging me for being so mean, but I couldn\u0027t stop talking. He looked at me like he wanted to say something, but he didn\u0027t. Instead he turned the movie back on. We sat there on the couch and finished watching the movie in silence. Toward the end I heard Conrad\u0027s voice on the stairs, and without even thinking I snuggled closer to Cam. I rested my head on his shoulder. Conrad and Nicole came back downstairs, and Conrad looked at the two of us for a second before saying, \"Tell my mom I took Nicole home.\" I barely looked up. \"Okay.\" As soon as they were gone, Cam sat straight up, and I did too. He took a breath. \"Did you invite me over here to make him jealous?\" \"Who?\" I said. \"You know who. Conrad.\" I could feel a flush rising up my chest and all the way to my cheeks. \"No.\" It seemed like everybody was wanting to know where things stood with Conrad and me. \"Do you still like him?\" \"No.\" He let out a breath of air. \"See, you hesitated.\" \"No, I didn\u0027t!\" Did I? Had I? I was sure I hadn\u0027t. To Cam I said, \"When I look at Conrad, all I feel is disgust.\" I could tell he didn\u0027t believe it. I didn\u0027t either. Because the truth was, when I looked at Conrad, all I felt was a yearning that never went away. It was the same as it had always been. Here I had this really great guy who actually liked me, and deep down inside I was still hung up on Conrad. There, that was the real truth. I had never really let go. I was just like Rose on that stupid makeshift raft. Cam cleared his throat and said, \"You\u0027re leaving soon. Do you want to keep in touch?\" I hadn\u0027t thought about that. He was right, the summer was almost over. Pretty soon I would be home again. \"Um ... do you?\" \"Well, yeah. I do.\" He looked at me like he was expecting something, and I couldn\u0027t figure out what it was for a few seconds. Then I said, \"Me too. I do too.\" But it came too late. Cam took his cell phone out of his pocket and said he\u0027d better get going. I didn\u0027t argue. chapter forty We finally had our movie night. My mother, Susannah, Jeremiah, and I watched Susannah\u0027s favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies in the rec room with all the lights off. My mother made kettle corn in the big cast-iron pot, and she went out and bought Milk Duds and gummy bears and saltwater taffy. Susannah loved saltwater taffy. It was classic, like old times, only without Steven and Conrad, who was working a dinner shift. Halfway through Notorious, her most favorite of all, Susannah fell asleep. My mother covered her with a blanket, and when the movie was over, she whispered, \"Jeremiah, will you carry her upstairs?\" Jeremiah, nodded quickly, and Susannah didn\u0027t even wake up when he lifted her in his arms and carried her up the rec room stairs. He picked her up like she was weightless, a feather. I\u0027d never seen him do that before. Even though we were almost the same age, in that moment he almost seemed grown-up. My mother got up too, stretching. \"I\u0027m exhausted. Are you going to bed, too, Belly?\" \"Not yet. I think I\u0027ll clean up down here first,\" I said. \"Good girl,\" she said, winking at me, and then she headed upstairs. I started picking up the taffy wrappers and a few kernels that had fallen onto the carpet. Jeremiah came back down when I was putting the movie into its case. He sank into the couch cushions. \"Let\u0027s not go to sleep yet,\" he said, looking up at me. \"Okay. Do you wanna watch another movie?\" \"Nah. Let\u0027s just watch TV.\" He picked up the remote and started flipping through channels randomly. \"Where\u0027s Cam Cameron been lately?\" Sitting back down, I sighed a little. \"I don\u0027t know. He hasn\u0027t called, and I haven\u0027t called him. The summer\u0027s almost over. I\u0027ll probably never see him again.\" He didn\u0027t look at me when he said, \"Do you want to? See him again?\" \"I don\u0027t know. . . . I\u0027m not sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\" Jeremiah put the TV on mute. He turned and looked at me then. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s the guy for you.\" His eyes looked somber. I\u0027d never seen him look so somber. Lightly I said, \"Yeah, I doubt it too.\" \"Belly . . . ,\" he began. He took a deep breath of air and puffed up his cheeks, and then he blew it out so hard the hair on his forehead fluttered. I could feel my heart start to pound--something was going to happen. He was going to say something I didn\u0027t want to hear. He was going to go and change everything. I opened my mouth to speak, to interrupt him before he said something he couldn\u0027t take back, and he shook his head. \"Just let me get this out.\" He took another deep breath. \"You\u0027ve always been my best friend. But now it\u0027s more. I see you as more than that.\" He continued, scooting closer to me. \"You\u0027re cooler than any other girl I\u0027ve ever met, and you\u0027re there for me. You\u0027ve always been there for me. I ... I can count on you. And you can count on me too. You know that.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-39.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
