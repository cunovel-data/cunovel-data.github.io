He seemed nervous, which made me feel less nervous.\n As we walked down the boardwalk, I let my arm hang loose-- in case. But he didn\u0027t reach for it. It was one of those perfect summer nights, the kind where there\u0027s a cool breeze and not one drop of rain. There would be rain tomorrow, but that night there were cool breezes and that was it.\n I said, \"Let\u0027s sit down so I can eat my apple,\" so we did. We sat on a bench that faced the beach.\n I bit into my apple, carefully; I was worried I might get caramel all stuck in my teeth, and then how would he kiss me?\n He sipped his Coke noisily, and then glanced down at his watch. \"When you finish that, let\u0027s go to the ring-toss.\"\n He wanted to win me a stuffed animal! I already knew which one I\u0027d pick too--the polar bear with wire-frame glasses and a scarf. I\u0027d had my eye on it all summer. I could already picture myself showing it off to Taylor. Oh, that? Conrad Fisher won it for me.\n I wolfed down the rest of my apple in about two bites. \u0027\"Kay,\" I said, wiping my mouth with the back of my hand. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n Conrad walked straight over to the ringtoss, and I had to walk superquick to keep up. As usual, he wasn\u0027t talking much, so I talked even more to make up for it. \"I think when we get back, my mom might finally get cable. Steven and my dad and I have been trying to convince her for forever. She claims to be so against TV, but then she watches movies on A\u0026E, like, the whole time we\u0027re here. It\u0027s so hypocritical,\" I said, and my voice trailed off when I saw that Conrad wasn\u0027t even listening. He was watching the girl who worked the ringtoss.\n She looked about fourteen or fifteen. The first thing I noticed about her was her shorts. They were canary yellow, and they were really, really short. The exact same kind of shorts that the boys had made fun of me for wearing two days before. I felt so good about buying those shorts with Susannah, and then the boys had laughed at me for it. The shorts looked a whole lot better on her.\n Her legs were skinny and freckled, and so were her arms. Everything about her was skinny, even her lips. Her hair was long and wavy. It was red, but it was so light it was almost peach. I think it might have been the prettiest hair I\u0027d ever seen. She had it pulled over to the side, and it was so long that she had to keep flicking it away as she handed people rings.\n Conrad had come to the boardwalk for her. He\u0027d brought me because he hadn\u0027t wanted to come alone and he hadn\u0027t wanted Steven and Jeremiah to give him a hard time. That was it. That was the whole reason. I could see it all in the way he looked at her, the way he almost seemed to hold his breath.\n \"Do you know her?\" I asked.\n He looked startled, like he\u0027d forgotten I was there. \"Her? No, not really.\"\n I bit my lip. \"Well, do you want to?\"\n \"Do I want to what?\" Conrad was confused, which was annoying.\n \"Do you want to know her?\" I asked impatiently. 1 guess.\n I grabbed him by his shirt sleeve and walked right up to the booth. The girl smiled at us, and I smiled back, but it was just for show. I was playing a part. \"How many rings?\" she asked. She had braces, but on her they looked interesting, like teeth jewelry and not like orthodontics.\n \"We\u0027ll take three,\" I told her. \"I like your shorts.\"\n \"Thanks,\" she said.\n Conrad cleared his throat. \"They\u0027re nice.\"\n \"I thought you said they were too short when I wore the exact same pair two days ago.\" I turned to the girl and said, \"Conrad is so overprotective. Do you have a big brother?\"\n She laughed. \"No.\" To Conrad she said, \"You think they\u0027re too short?\"\n He blushed. I\u0027d never seen him blush before, not in the whole time I\u0027d known him. I had a feeling it might be the last time. I made a big show of looking at my watch and said, \"Con, I\u0027m gonna go ride the Ferris wheel before we leave. Win me a prize, okay?\"\n Conrad nodded quickly, and I said bye to the girl and left. I walked over to the Ferris wheel as fast as I could so they wouldn\u0027t see me cry.\n Later on, I found out the girl\u0027s name was Angie. Conrad ended up winning me the polar bear with the wire-frame glasses and scarf. He said Angie told him it was the best prize they had. He said he thought I\u0027d like it too. I told him I\u0027d rather have had the giraffe, but thanks anyway. I named him Junior Mint, and I left him where he belonged, at the summer house.\n Chapter three\n After I unpacked, I went straight down to the pool, where I knew the boys would be. They were lying around on the deck chairs, their dirty bare feet hanging off the edges.\n As soon as Jeremiah saw me, he sprang up. \"Ladies and Gentlemen-men-men,\" he began dramatically, bowing like a circus ringmaster. \"I do believe it is time ... for our first belly flop of the summer.\"\n I inched away from them uneasily. Too fast a movement, and it would be all over--they\u0027d chase me then. \"No way,\" I said.\n Then Conrad and Steven stood up, circling me. \"You can\u0027t fight tradition,\" Steven said. Conrad just grinned evilly.\n \"I\u0027m too old for this,\" I said desperately. I walked backward, and that\u0027s when they grabbed me. Steven and Jeremiah each took a wrist.\n \"Come on, guys,\" I said, trying to wriggle out of their grasp. I dragged my feet, but they pulled me along. I knew it was futile to resist, but I always tried, even though the bottoms of my feet got burned along the pavement in the process.\n \"Ready?\" Jeremiah said, lifting me up under my armpits.\n Conrad grabbed my feet, and then Steven took my right arm while Jeremiah hung on to my left. They swung me back and forth like I was a sack of flour. \"I hate you guys,\" I yelled over their laughter.\n \"One,\" Jeremiah began.\n \"Two,\" Steven said.\n \"And three,\" Conrad finished. Then they launched me into the pool, clothes and all. I hit the water with a loud smack. Underwater, I could hear them busting up.\n The Belly Flop was something they\u0027d started about a million summers ago. Probably it had been Steven. I hated it. Even though it was one of the only times I was included in their fun, I hated being the brunt of it. It made me feel utterly powerless, and it was a reminder that I was an outsider, too weak to fight them, all because I was a girl. Somebody\u0027s little sister.\n I used to cry about it, run to Susannah and my mother, but it didn\u0027t do any good. The boys just accused me of being a tattletale. Not this time, though. This time I was going to be a good sport. If I was a good sport, maybe that would take away some of their joy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-3.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Belly measures her life in summers.
