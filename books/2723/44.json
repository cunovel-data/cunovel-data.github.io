{"id":78938,"no":44,"title":"Page 44","content":"Somehow we got around to talking about proms and dances. Susannah loved to talk about anything girly; she said I was the only person she could talk to about those kinds of things. My mother certainly wouldn\u0027t, and neither would Conrad and Jeremiah. Only me, her pretend-daughter.\\n\\n She said, \"Make sure you send me pictures of you at your first big dance.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t gone to any of my school\u0027s homecomings or proms yet. No one had asked me, and I hadn\u0027t really felt like it. The one person I wanted to go with didn\u0027t go to my school. I told her, \"I will. I\u0027ll wear that dress you bought me last summer.\"\\n\\n \"What dress?\"\\n\\n \"The one from that mall, the purple one that you and Mom fought over that time. Remember, you put it in my suitcase?\"\\n\\n She frowned, confused. \"I didn\u0027t buy you that dress. Laurel would\u0027ve had a fit.\" Then her face cleared, and she smiled. \"Your mother must have gone back and bought it for you.\"\\n\\n \"My mother?\" My mother would never.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s your mother. So like her.\"\\n\\n \"But she never said . . .\" My voice trailed off. I hadn\u0027t even considered the possibility that it had been my mother who\u0027d bought it for me.\\n\\n \"She wouldn\u0027t. She\u0027s not like that.\" Susannah reached across the table and grabbed my hand. \"You\u0027re the luckiest girl in the world to have her for a mother. Know that.\"\\n\\n The sky was gray, and there was a chill in the air. It would rain soon.\\n\\n It was so misty out that it took me a minute to find him. I finally did, about half a mile down. It always came back to the beach. He was sitting, his knees close to his chest. He didn\u0027t look at me when I sat down next to him. He just stared out at the ocean.\\n\\n His eyes were these bleak and empty abysses, like sockets. There was nothing there. The boy I thought I knew so well was gone. He looked so lost sitting there. I felt that old lurch, that gravitational pull, that desire to inhabit him--like wherever he was in this world, I would know where to find him, and I would do it. I would find him and take him home. I would take care of him, just like Susannah wanted.\\n\\n I spoke first. \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m really, really sorry. I wish I had known--\"\\n\\n \"Please stop talking,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered, starting to get up. I was always saying the wrong thing.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t leave,\" Conrad said, and his shoulders collapsed. His face did too. He hid it in his hands, and he was five years old again, we both were.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so pissed at her,\" he said, each word coming out of him like a gust of concentrated air. He bowed his head, his shoulders broken and bent. He was finally crying.\\n\\n I watched him silently. I felt like I was intruding on a private moment, one he\u0027d never let me see if he weren\u0027t grieving. The old Conrad liked to be in control.\\n\\n The old pull, the tide drawing me back in. I kept getting caught in this current--first love, I mean. First love kept making me come back to this, to him. He still took my breath away, just being near him. I had been lying to myself the night before, thinking I was free, thinking I had let him go. It didn\u0027t matter what he said or did, I\u0027d never let him go.\\n\\n I wondered if it was possible to take someone\u0027s pain away with a kiss. Because that was what I wanted to do, take all of his sadness and pour it out of him, comfort him, make the boy I knew come back. I reached out and touched the back of his neck. He jerked forward, the slightest motion, but I didn\u0027t take my hand away. I let it rest there, stroking the back of his hair, and then I cupped the back of his head, moved it toward me, and kissed him. Tentatively at first, and then he started kissing me back, and we were kissing each other. His lips were warm and needy. He needed me. My mind went pure blinding white, and the only thought I had was, I\u0027m kissing Conrad Fisher, and he\u0027s kissing me back. Susannah was dying, and I was kissing Conrad.\\n\\n He was the one to break away. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, his voice raw and scratchy.\\n\\n I touched my lips with the backs of my fingers. \"For what?\" I couldn\u0027t seem to catch my breath.\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t happen like this.\" He stopped, then started again. \"I do think about you. You know that. I just can\u0027t . .. Can you .. . Can you just be here with me?\"\\n\\n I nodded. I was afraid to open my mouth.\\n\\n I took his hand and squeezed it, and it felt like the most right thing I had done in a long time. We sat there in the sand, holding hands like it was something we\u0027d been doing all along. It started to rain, soft at first. The first raindrops hit the sand, and the grains beaded up, rolled away.\\n\\n It started to come down harder, and I wanted to get up and go back to the house, but I could tell Conrad didn\u0027t. So I sat there with him, holding his hand and saying nothing. Everything else felt really far away; it was just us.\\n\\n Chapter forty - four\\n\\n Toward the end of summer everything slowed down, and it started to feel ready to be done. It was like with snow days. We once had this great big blizzard, and we didn\u0027t go to school for two whole weeks. After a while you just wanted to get out of the house, even if that meant school. Being at the summer house felt like that. Even paradise could be suffocating. You could only sit on the beach doing nothing so many times before you felt ready to go. I felt it a week before we left, every time. And then of course, when the time came, I was never ready to leave. I wanted to stay forever. It was a total catch-22, like a contradiction in terms. Because as soon as we were in the car, driving away, all I wanted to do was jump out and run back to the house.\\n\\n Cam called me twice. Both times I didn\u0027t answer. I let it go to voice mail. The first time he called, he didn\u0027t leave a message. The second time he said, \"Hey, it\u0027s Cam. . . . I hope I get to see you before we both leave. But if not, then, well, it was really nice hanging out with you. So, yeah. Call me back, if you want.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what to say to him. I loved Conrad and I probably always would. I would spend my whole life loving him one way or another. Maybe I would get married, maybe I would have a family, but it wouldn\u0027t matter, because a piece of my heart, the piece where summer lived, would always be Conrad\u0027s. How did I say those things to Cam? How did I tell him that there was a piece saved for him, too? He was the first boy to tell me I was beautiful. That had to count for something. But there was no way for me to say any of those things to him. So I did the only thing I could think to do. I just left it alone. I didn\u0027t call him back.\\n\\n With Jeremiah it was easier. And by that I mean he went easy on me. He let me off the hook. He pretended like it hadn\u0027t happened, like we hadn\u0027t said any of those things down in the rec room. He went on telling jokes and calling me Belly Button and just being Jeremiah. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-44.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
