{"id":78911,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"I didn\u0027t go back to bed right away. I stayed on the front porch awhile, feeling blue and a little teary--not that I would ever admit it to Steven.\\n\\n In a lot of ways it was like the last summer. That fall, Conrad would start college. He was going to Brown. He might not come back next summer. He might have an internship, or summer school, or he might backpack across Europe with all his new dorm buddies. And Jeremiah, he might go to the football camp he was always talking about. There were a lot of things that could happen between now and then. It occurred to me that I was going to have to make the most of this summer, really make it count, in case there wasn\u0027t another one quite like it. After all, I would be sixteen soon. I was getting older too. Things couldn\u0027t stay the same forever.\\n\\n Chapter twenty\\n\\n AGE II\\n\\n The four of us were lying on a big blanket in the sand. Conrad, Steven, Jeremiah, and then me on the edge. That was my spot. When they let me come along .This was one of those rare days.\\n\\n It was already midafternoon, so hot my hair felt like it was on fire, and they were playing cards while I listened in.\\n\\n Jeremiah said, \"Would you rather be boiled in olive oil or skinned alive with a burning hot butter knife?\"\\n\\n \"Olive oil,\" said Conrad confidently. \"It\u0027s over quicker.\"\\n\\n \"Olive oil,\" I echoed.\\n\\n \"Butter knife,\" said Steven. \"There\u0027s more of a chance I can turn the tables on the guy and skin him.\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t an option,\" Conrad told him. \"It\u0027s a question about death, not turning the tables on somebody.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. Olive oil,\" Steven said grumpily. \"What about you, Jeremiah?\"\\n\\n \"Olive oil,\" Jeremiah said. \"Now you go, Con.\"\\n\\n Conrad squinted his eyes up at the sun and said, \"Would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones?\"\\n\\n Jeremiah didn\u0027t say anything for a minute. He loved this game. He loved to mull over the different possibilities. \"With that one perfect day, would I know I was reliving it, like Groundhog Day?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll take the perfect day,\" he decided.\\n\\n \"Well, if the perfect day involves--,\" Steven began, but then he looked over at me and stopped speaking, which I hated. \"I\u0027ll take the perfect day too.\"\\n\\n \"Belly?\" Conrad looked at me. \"What would you pick?\"\\n\\n My mind raced around in circles as I tried to find the right answer. \"Urn. I\u0027d take living my life with decent days. That way I could still hope for that one perfect day,\" I said. \"I wouldn\u0027t want to have a life that\u0027s just one day over and over.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but you wouldn\u0027t know it,\" Jeremiah argued.\\n\\n I shrugged. \"But you might, deep down.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s stupid,\" Steven said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s stupid. I think I agree with her.\" Conrad gave me this look, the kind of look I bet soldiers give each other when they\u0027re teaming up against somebody else. It was like we were in it together.\\n\\n I gave Steven a little shimmy. I couldn\u0027t help myself. \"See?\" I said. \"Conrad agrees with me.\"\\n\\n Steven mimicked, \"Conrad agrees with me. Conrad loves me. Conrad\u0027s awesome--\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Steven!\" I yelled.\\n\\n He grinned and said, \"My turn to ask a question. Belly, would you rather eat mayonnaise every day, or be flat-chested for the rest of your life?\"\\n\\n I turned on my side, grabbed a handful of sand, and threw it at Steven. He was in the middle of laughing, and a bunch got in his mouth and stuck to his wet cheeks. He screamed, \"You\u0027re dead, Belly!\"\\n\\n Then he lunged at me, and I rolled away from him. \"Leave me alone,\" I said defiantly. \"You can\u0027t hurt me or I\u0027ll tell Mom.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a pain in the ass,\" he spat out, grabbing my leg roughly. \"I\u0027m throwing you in the water.\"\\n\\n I tried to shake him off, but I only succeeded in kicking more sand into his face. Which of course only made him madder.\\n\\n Conrad said, \"Leave her alone, Steven. Let\u0027s go swim.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, come on,\" said Jeremiah.\\n\\n Steven hesitated. \"Fine,\" he said, spitting out sand. \"But you\u0027re still dead, Belly.\" He pointed at me, and then made a cutting motion with his finger.\\n\\n I gave him the finger and flipped over, but inside I was shaking. Conrad had defended me. Conrad cared whether or not I was dead.\\n\\n Steven was mad at me the whole rest of the day, but it was worth it. It was also ironic, Steven teasing me about being flat-chested, because two summers later I had to wear a bra, but, like, for real.\\n\\n Chapter twenty-one\\n\\n The night Steven left, I headed down to the pool for one of my midnight swims, and Conrad and Jeremiah and this neighbor guy Clay Bertolet were sitting on the lounge chairs drinking beer. Clay lived way down the street, and he\u0027d been coming to Cousins Beach for almost as long as we had. He was a year older than Conrad. No one had even liked him much. He was just a person to hang out with, I guess.\\n\\n Right away I stiffened and held my beach towel closer to my chest. I wondered if I should turn back. Clay had always made me nervous. I didn\u0027t have to swim that night. I could do it the next night. But no, I had as much right to be out there as they did. More, even.\\n\\n I walked over to them, pretend-confident. \"Hey, guys,\" I said. I didn\u0027t let go of my towel. It felt funny to be standing there in a towel and a bikini when they were all wearing clothes.\\n\\n Clay looked up at me, his eyes narrow. \"Hey, Belly. Long time no see.\" He patted the lounge chair. \"Sit down.\"\\n\\n I hated when people said \"long time no see.\" It was such a dumb way to say hello. But I sat down anyway.\\n\\n He leaned in and gave me a hug. He smelled like beer and Polo Sport. \"So how\u0027ve you been?\" he asked.\\n\\n Before I could answer, Conrad said, \"She\u0027s fine, and now it\u0027s time for bed. Good night, Belly.\"\\n\\n I tried not to sound like a five-year-old when I said, \"I\u0027m not going to sleep yet, I\u0027m swimming.\"\\n\\n \"You should head back up,\" Jeremiah said, putting his beer down. \"Your mom will kill you for drinking.\"\\n\\n \"Hello. I\u0027m not drinking,\" I reminded him.\\n\\n Clay offered me his Corona. \"Here,\" he said, winking. He seemed drunk.\\n\\n I hesitated, and Conrad snapped irritably, \"Don\u0027t give her that. She\u0027s a kid, for God\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n I glared at him. \"Quit acting like Steven.\" For a second or two I considered taking Clay\u0027s beer. It would be my first. But then I\u0027d only be doing it to spite Conrad, and I wasn\u0027t going to let him control what I did.\\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" I told him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-17.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
