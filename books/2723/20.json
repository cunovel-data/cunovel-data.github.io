The blond Red Sox girl looked me up and down. \"Hello,\" she said. Conrad said, \"With who?\" I pointed at Cam. \"Him.\" \"You\u0027re not riding with someone you don\u0027t even know,\" he said flatly. \"I do so know him. He\u0027s Sextus.\" He narrowed his eyes. \"Sex what?\" \"Never mind. His name is Cam, he\u0027s studying whales, and you don\u0027t get to decide who I ride home with. I was just letting you know, as a courtesy. I wasn\u0027t asking for your permission.\" I started to walk away, but he grabbed my elbow. \"I don\u0027t care what he\u0027s studying. It\u0027s not gonna happen,\" he said casually, but his grip was tight. \"If you want to go, I\u0027ll take you.\" I took a deep breath. I had to keep cool. I wasn\u0027t going to let him goad me into being a baby, not in front of all these people. \"No, thanks,\" I said, trying to walk away again. But he didn\u0027t let go. \"I thought you already had a boyfriend?\" His tone was mocking, and I knew he\u0027d seen through my lie the night before. I wanted so badly to throw a handful of sand in his face. I tried to twist out of his grip. \"Let go of me! That hurts!\" He let go immediately, his face red. It didn\u0027t really hurt, but I wanted to embarrass him the way he was embarrassing me. I said loudly, \"I\u0027d rather ride with a stranger than with someone who\u0027s been drinking!\" \"I\u0027ve had one beer,\" he snapped. \"I weigh a hundred and seventy-five pounds. Wait half an hour and I\u0027ll take you. Stop being such a brat.\" I could feel tears starting to spark my eyelids. I looked over my shoulder to see if Cam was watching. He was. \"You\u0027re an ass**le,\" I said. He looked me dead in the eyes and said, \"And you\u0027re a four-year-old.\" As I walked away, I heard the girl ask, \"Is she your girlfriend?\" I whirled around, and we both said \"No!\" at the same time. Confused, she said, \"Well, is she your little sister?\" like I wasn\u0027t standing right there. Her perfume was heavy. It felt like it filled all the air around us, like we were breathing her in. \"No, I\u0027m not his little sister.\" I hated this girl for being a witness to all this. It was humiliating. And she was pretty, in the same kind of way Taylor was pretty, which somehow made things worse. Conrad said, \"Her mom is best friends with my mom.\" So that was all I was to him? His mom\u0027s friend\u0027s daughter? I took a deep breath, and without even thinking, I said to the girl, \"I\u0027ve known Conrad my whole life. So let me be the one to tell you you\u0027re barking up the wrong tree. Conrad will never love anyone as much as he loves himself, if you know what I mean--\" I lifted up my hand and wiggled my fingers. \"Shut up, Belly,\" Conrad warned. The tops of his ears were turning bright red. It was a low blow, but I didn\u0027t care. He deserved it. Red Sox girl frowned. \"What is she talking about, Conrad?\" To her I blurted out, \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, do you not know what the idiom \u0027barking up the wrong tree\u0027 means?\" Her pretty face twisted. \"You little skank,\" she hissed. I could feel myself shrinking. I wished I could take it back. I\u0027d never gotten into a fight with a girl before, or with anyone for that matter. Thankfully, Conrad broke in then and pointed to the bonfire. \"Belly, go back over there, and wait for me to come get you,\" he said harshly. That\u0027s when Jeremiah ambled over. \"Hey, hey, what\u0027s going on?\" he asked, smiling in his easy, goofy way. \"Your brother is a jerk,\" I said. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s going Jeremiah put his arm around me. He smelled like beer. \"You guys play nice, you hear?\" I shrugged out of his hold and said, \"I am playing nice. Tell your brother to play nice.\" \"Wait, are you guys brother and sister too?\" the girl asked. Conrad said, \"Don\u0027t even think about leaving with that guy.\" \"Con, chill out,\" Jeremiah said. \"She\u0027s not leaving. Right, Belly?\" He looked at me, and I pursed my lips and nodded. Then I gave Conrad the dirtiest look I could muster, and I shot one at the girl, too, when I was far enough away that she wouldn\u0027t be able to reach out and grab me by the hair. I walked back to the bonfire, trying to keep my shoulders straight and high, when inside I felt like a kid who\u0027d gotten yelled at at her own birthday party. It wasn\u0027t fair, to be treated like I was a kid when I wasn\u0027t. I bet me and that girl were the same age. Cam said, \"What was that all about?\" I was choking back tears as I said, \"Let\u0027s just go.\" He hesitated, glancing back over at Conrad. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s such a good idea, Flavia. But I\u0027ll stay here with you and hang out for a while. The whales can wait.\" I wanted to kiss him then. I wanted to forget I ever knew Conrad and just be there, existing in the bubble of that moment. The first firework went off, somewhere high above us. It sounded like a teakettle whistling loud and proud. It was gold, and it exploded into millions of gold flecks, like confetti over our heads. We sat by the fire and he told me about whales and I told him about stupid things, like being secretary of French Club, and how my favorite food was pulled pork sandwiches. He said he was a vegetarian. We must have sat there for an hour. I could feel Conrad watching us the whole time, and I was so tempted to give him the finger--I hated it when he won. When it started to get cold, I rubbed my arms, and Cam took off his hoodie and gave it to me. Which, was sort of my dream come true--getting cold and having a guy actually give you his hoodie instead of gloating over how smart he\u0027d been to bring one. Underneath, his T-shirt said STRAIGHT EDGE , with a picture of a razor blade, the kind a guy shaves with. \"What does that mean?\" I asked, zipping up his hoodie. It was warm and it smelled like boy, but in a good way. \"I\u0027m straight edge,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t drink or do drugs. I used to be hardcore, where you don\u0027t take over-the-counter medicine or drink caffeine, but I quit that.\" \"Why?\"\u0027 \"Why was I hardcore straight edge or why did I quit?\" \"Both.\" \"I don\u0027t believe in polluting your body with unnatural stuff,\" he said. \"I quit because it was making my mom crazy. And I also just really missed Dr Pepper.\" I liked Dr Pepper too. I was glad I hadn\u0027t been drinking. I didn\u0027t want him to think badly of me. I wanted him to think I was cool, like the kind of girl who didn\u0027t care what people thought, the kind of person he obviously was. I wanted to be his friend. I also wanted to kiss him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-20.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
