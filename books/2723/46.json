{"id":78940,"no":46,"title":"Page 46","content":"\"Hello,\" I said, still floating on my back. Conrad dipped his toe in. \"It\u0027s kind of cold to swim, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Chicken,\" I said, squawking loudly. \"Just jump in and get it over with.\" They looked at each other. Then Jeremiah made a running leap and cannonballed in, and Conrad followed right behind him. They made two big splashes, and I swallowed a ton of water because I was smiling, but I didn\u0027t care. We swam over to the deep end, and I treaded water to stay afloat. Conrad reached over and pushed my bangs out of my eyes. It was a tiny gesture, but Jeremiah saw, and he turned away, swam closer to the edge of the pool. For a second I felt sad, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, it came to me. A memory, pressed in my heart like a leaf in a book. I lifted my arms in the air and twirled around in circles, like a water ballerina. Spinning, I began to recite, \"Maggie and milly and molly and may / went down to the beach (to play one day) / and maggie discovered a shell that sang / so sweetly she couldn\u0027t remember her troubles, and / milly befriended a stranded star / whose rays five languid fingers were--\" Jeremiah grinned. \"And molly was chased by a horrible thing / which raced sideways while blowing bubbles: and / may came home with a smooth round stone / as small as a world and as large as alone. . . .\" Together, Conrad too, we all said, \"For whatever we lose (like a you or a me) / it\u0027s always ourselves we find in the sea.\" And then there was this silence between us, and no one said anything. It was Susannah\u0027s favorite poem; she\u0027d taught it to us kids a long time ago--we were on one of her guided nature walks where she pointed out shells and jellyfish. That day we marched down the beach, arms linked, and we recited it so loudly that I think we woke up the fish. We knew it like we knew the Pledge of Allegiance, by heart. \"This might be our last summer here,\" I said suddenly. \"No way,\" Jeremiah said, floating up next to me. \"Conrad\u0027s going to college this fall, and you have football camp,\" I reminded him. Even though Conrad going to college and Jeremiah going to football camp for two weeks didn\u0027t really have anything to do with us not coming back next summer. I didn\u0027t say what we were all thinking, that Susannah was sick, that she might never get better, that she was the string that tied us all together. Conrad shook his head. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027ll always come back.\" Briefly I wondered if he meant just him and Jeremiah, and then he said, \"All of us.\" It got quiet again, and then I had an idea. \"Let\u0027s make a whirlpool!\" I said, clapping my hands together. \"You\u0027re such a kid,\" Conrad said, smiling at me and shaking his head. For the first time, it didn\u0027t bother me when he called me a kid. It felt like a compliment. I floated out to the middle of the pool. \"Come on, guys!\" They swam over to me, and we made a circle and started to run as fast as we could. \"Faster!\" Jeremiah yelled, laughing. Then we stopped, let our bodies go limp and get caught in the whirlpool we\u0027d just made. I leaned my head back and let the current carry me. Chapter forty - six When he called, I didn\u0027t recognize his voice, partly because I wasn\u0027t expecting it and partly because I was still half-asleep. He said, \"I\u0027m in my car on my way to your house. Can I see you?\" It was twelve thirty in the morning. Boston was five and a half hours away. He had driven all night. He wanted to see me. I told him to park down the street and I would meet him on the corner, after my mother had gone to bed. He said he\u0027d wait. I turned the lights off and waited by the window, watching for the taillights. As soon as I saw his car, I wanted to run outside, but I had to wait. I could hear my mother rustling around in her room, and I knew she would read in bed for at least half an hour before she fell asleep. It felt like torture, knowing he was out there waiting for me, not being able to go to him. In the dark I put on my scarf and hat that Granna knit me for Christmas. Then I shut my bedroom door and tiptoe down the hallway to my mother\u0027s room, pressing my ear against the door. The light is off and I can hear her snoring softly. Steven\u0027s not even home yet, which is lucky for me, because he\u0027s a light sleeper just like our dad. My mother is finally asleep; the house is still and silent. Our Christmas tree is still up. We keep the lights on all night because it makes it still feel like Christmas, like any minute, Santa could show up with gifts. I don\u0027t bother leaving her a note. I\u0027ll call her in the morning, when she wakes up and wonders where I am. I creep down the stairs, careful on the creaky step in the middle, but once I\u0027m out of the house, I\u0027m flying down the front steps, across the frosty lawn. It crunches along the bottoms of my sneakers. I forgot to put on my coat. I remembered the scarf and hat, but no coat. His car is on the corner, right where it\u0027s supposed to be. The car is dark, no lights, and I open the passenger side door like I\u0027ve done it a million times before. But I haven\u0027t. I\u0027ve never even been inside. I haven\u0027t seen him since August. I poke my head inside, but I don\u0027t go in, not yet. I want to look at him first. I have to. It\u0027s winter, and he\u0027s wearing a gray fleece. His cheeks are pink from the cold, his tan has faded, but he still looks the same. \"Hey,\" I say, and then I climb inside. \"You\u0027re not wearing a coat,\" he says. \"It\u0027s not that cold,\" I say, even though it is, even though I\u0027m shivering as I say it. \"Here,\" he says, shrugging out of his fleece and handing it to me. I put it on. It\u0027s warm, and it doesn\u0027t smell like cigarettes. It just smells like him. So Conrad quit smoking after all. The thought makes me smile. He starts the engine. I say, \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re really here.\" He sounds almost shy when he says, \"Me neither.\" And then he hesitates. \"Are you still coming with me?\" I can\u0027t believe he even has to ask. I would go anywhere. \"Yes,\" I tell him. It feels like nothing else exists outside of that word, this moment. There\u0027s just us. Everything that happened this past summer, and every summer before it, has all led up to this. To now.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-46.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
