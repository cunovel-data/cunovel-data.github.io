{"id":78916,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"But that morning I had no choice. In case Cam called, I mean. So I lay there, sweating and sizzling like a piece of chicken on a grill. It was boring, but it was a necessity.\\n\\n Just after ten, the phone rang. I sprang up and ran into the kitchen. \"Hello?\" I said breathlessly.\\n\\n \"Hi, Belly. It\u0027s Mr. Fisher.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, hi, Mr. Fisher,\" I said. I tried not to sound too disappointed.\\n\\n He cleared his throat. \"So, how\u0027s it going down there?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty good. Susannah\u0027s not home, though. She and my mom went to Dyerstown to visit some galleries.\" \"I see. ... How are the boys?\"\\n\\n \"Good ...\" I never knew what to say to Mr. Fisher. \"Conrad\u0027s at work and Jeremiah\u0027s still asleep. Do you want me to wake him up?\"\\n\\n \"No, no, that\u0027s all right.\"\\n\\n There was this long pause, and I scrambled to think of something to say.\\n\\n \"Are you, um, coming down this weekend?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No, not this weekend,\" he said. His voice sounded really far away. \"I\u0027ll just call back later. You have fun, Belly.\"\\n\\n I hung up the phone. Mr. Fisher hadn\u0027t been down to Cousins once yet. He used to come the weekend after the Fourth, because it was easier getting away from work after the holiday. When he came, he\u0027d fire up the barbecue all weekend long, and he\u0027d wear his apron that said chef knows best . I wondered if Susannah would be sad he wasn\u0027t coming, if the boys would care.\\n\\n I trudged back to my lounge chair, back to the sun. I fell asleep on my lounge chair, and I woke up to Jeremiah sprinkling Kool-Aid onto my stomach. \"Quit it,\" I said grouchily, sitting up. I was thirsty from my extra sweet Kool-Aid (I always made it with double sugar), and I felt dehydrated and sweaty.\\n\\n He laughed and sat down on my lounge chair. \"Is this what you\u0027re doing all day?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, wiping off my stomach and then wiping my hand on his shorts.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be boring. Come do something with me,\" he ordered. \"I don\u0027t have to work until tonight.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m working on my tan,\" I told him.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re tan enough.\"\\n\\n \"Will you let me drive?\"\\n\\n He hesitated. \"Fine,\" he said. \"But you have to rinse off first. I don\u0027t want you getting my seat all oily.\"\\n\\n I stood up, throwing my limp greasy hair into a high ponytail. \"I\u0027ll go right now. Just wait,\" I said.\\n\\n Jeremiah waited for me in the car, with the AC on full blast. He sat in the passenger seat. \"Where are we going?\" I asked, getting into the driver\u0027s seat. I felt like an old pro. \"Tennessee? New Mexico? We have to go far so I can get good practice.\"\\n\\n He closed his eyes and laid his head back. \"Just take a left out of the driveway,\" he told me.\\n\\n \"Yessir,\" I said, turning off the AC and opening all four windows. It was so much better driving with the windows down. It felt like you were actually going somewhere.\\n\\n He continued giving me directions, and then we pulled up to Go Kart City. \"Are you serious?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re gonna get you some driving practice,\" he said, grinning like crazy.\\n\\n We waited in line for the cars, and when it was our turn, the guy told me to get in the blue one. I said, \"Can I drive the red one instead?\"\\n\\n He winked at me and said, \"You\u0027re so pretty, I\u0027d let you drive my car.\"\\n\\n I could feel myself blush, but I liked it. The guy was older than me, and he was actually paying me attention. It was kind of amazing. I\u0027d seen him there the summer before, and he hadn\u0027t looked at me once.\\n\\n Getting into the car next to me, Jeremiah muttered, \"What a freaking cheeseball. He needs to get a real job.\"\\n\\n \"Like lifeguarding is a real job?\" I countered.\\n\\n Jeremiah scowled. \"Just drive.\"\\n\\n Every time my car came back around the track, the guy waved at me. The third time he did it, I waved back.\\n\\n We rode around the track a bunch of times, until it was time for Jeremiah to go to work.\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027ve had enough driving for today,\" Jeremiah said, rubbing his neck. \"I\u0027ll drive us home.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t argue with him. He drove home fast, and dropped me off at the curb and headed to work. I stepped back into the house feeling very tired and tan. And also satisfied.\\n\\n \"Someone named Cam called for you,\" my mother said. She was sitting at the kitchen table, reading the paper with her horn-rimmed reading glasses on. She didn\u0027t look up.\\n\\n \"He did?\" I asked, covering my smile with the back of my hand. \"Well, did he leave a number?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said. \"He said he\u0027d call back.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you ask for it?\" I said, and I hated the whininess in my voice, but when it came to my mother, it was like I couldn\u0027t help it.\\n\\n That\u0027s when she looked at me, perplexed. \"I don\u0027t know. He wasn\u0027t offering it. Who is he anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" I told her, walking over to the refrigerator for some lemonade.\\n\\n \"Suit yourself,\" my mother said, going back to her paper.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t press the issue. She never did. She at least could have gotten his number. If Susannah had been down here instead of her, she would have been singsongy and she would have teased and snooped until I told her everything. Which I would have, gladly.\\n\\n \"Mr. Fisher called this morning,\" I said.\\n\\n My mother looked up again. \"What did he say?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing much. Just that he can\u0027t come this weekend.\"\\n\\n She pursed her lips, but she didn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Susannah?\" I asked. \"Is she in her room?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but she doesn\u0027t feel well. She\u0027s taking a nap,\" my mother said. In other words, Don\u0027t go up and bother her.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with her?\"\\n\\n \"She has a summer cold,\" my mother said automatically.\\n\\n My mother was a terrible liar. Susannah had been spending a lot of time in her room, and there was a sadness to her that hadn\u0027t been there before. I knew something was up. I just wasn\u0027t completely sure what.\\n\\n Chapter twenty -three\\n\\n Cam called again the next night, and the night after that. We talked on the phone twice before we met up again, for, like, four or five hours at a time. When we talked, I lay on one of the lounge chairs on the porch and stared up at the moon with my toes pointed toward the sky. I laughed so hard that Jeremiah yelled out his window for me to keep it down. We talked about everything, and I loved it, but the whole time I wondered when he was going to ask to see me again. He didn\u0027t.\\n\\n So I had to take matters into my own hands. I invited Cam to come over and play video games and maybe swim. I felt like some kind of liberated woman calling him up and inviting him over, like it was the kind of thing I did all the time. When really, I was only doing it because I knew no one was going to be at home. I didn\u0027t want Jeremiah or Conrad or my mother or even Susannah to see him just yet. For now, he was just mine. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-22.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
