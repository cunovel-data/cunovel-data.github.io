Jeremiah said, \"You shouldn\u0027t use the word \u0027gay\u0027 like Taylor opened her mouth and closed it. Then she said, \"I didn\u0027t mean anything by it, Jeremy. I just meant he\u0027s being lame.\" \"Well, \u0027gay\u0027 doesn\u0027t mean \u0027lame,\u0027 Taylor, now does it?\" Jeremiah said. He spoke in a sarcastic tone, but even mean attention was better than no attention. Probably he was just mad about all the attention she\u0027d been giving Conrad that day. Taylor heaved a great big sigh and turned to Conrad. \"Conrad, you\u0027re being very lame. Play truth or dare with us. He ignored her and turned the volume on the TV up louder. Then he pretended to mute her with the remote, which made me laugh out loud. \"Fine, he\u0027s out. Steven, truth or dare.\" Steven rolled his eyes. \"Truth.\" Taylor\u0027s eyes lit up. \"Okay. How far did you go with Claire Cho?\" I knew she\u0027d been saving that one up for a long time, waiting for the exact moment she could ask. Claire Cho was a girl that Steven had dated for most of freshman year. Taylor swore Claire had cankles, but I thought Claire\u0027s ankles were perfectly slim. I thought Claire Cho was kind of perfect. Steven actually blushed. \"I\u0027m not answering that.\" \"You have to. It\u0027s truth or dare. You can\u0027t sit here and listen to other people tell secrets if you\u0027re not going to,\" I said. I had been wondering about him and Claire too. \"Nobody\u0027s even told any secrets yet!\" he protested. \"We\u0027re about to, Steven,\" Taylor said. \"Now man up and tell us.\" \"Yeah, Steven, man up,\" Jeremiah chimed in. We all started to chant, \"Man up! Man up!\" Even Conrad turned the TV on mute to hear the answer. \"Fine,\" Steven said. \"If you shut up, I\u0027ll tell you.\" We shut right up and waited. \"Well?\" I said. \"Third,\" he said at last. I relaxed back into the couch. Third base. Wow. Interesting. My brother had been to third base. Weird. Gross. Taylor looked pink with satisfaction. \"Well done, Stevie.\" He shook his head at her and said, \"Now it\u0027s my turn.\" He looked around the room, and I sank deep into the couch cushions. I really, really hoped he wasn\u0027t going to pick me and make me say it out loud--how I hadn\u0027t even so much as kissed a boy yet. Knowing Steven, he would. He surprised me when he said, \"Taylor. Truth or dare?\" He was actually playing along. Automatically she said, \"You can\u0027t pick me because I just asked you. You have to pick someone else.\" Which was true, that was the rule. \"Are you scared, Tay-Tay? Why don\u0027t you man up?\" Taylor hesitated. \"Fine. Truth.\" Steven grinned evilly. \"Who would you kiss in this room?\" Taylor considered it for a few seconds, and then she got that cat-that-ate-the-canary look on her face. It was the same look she\u0027d had on her face when she\u0027d dyed her little sister\u0027s hair blue when we were eight. She waited until she had everyone\u0027s attention, and then she said, triumphantly, \"Belly.\" There was a stunned kind of silence for a minute, and then everyone started to laugh, Conrad loudest. I threw a pillow at Taylor, hard. \"That\u0027s not fair. You didn\u0027t answer for real,\" Jeremiah said, shaking his finger at her. \"Yes, I did,\" Taylor said smugly. \"I pick Belly. Take a closer look at everybody\u0027s favorite little sister, Jeremy. She\u0027s turning hot before your very eyes.\" I hid my face behind a pillow. I knew I was blushing even harder than Steven had. Mostly because it wasn\u0027t true, I wasn\u0027t turning hot before anyone\u0027s eyes, and we all knew it. \"Taylor, shut up. Please shut up.\" \"Yes, please shut up, Tay- Tay,\" Steven said. He looked kind of red too. \"If you\u0027re so serious, then kiss her,\" said Conrad, his eyes still on the TV. \"Hey,\" I said, glaring at him. \"I\u0027m a person. You can\u0027t just kiss me without my permission.\" He looked at me and said, \"I\u0027m not the one who wants to kiss you.\" Hotly, I said, \"Either way, permission not granted. To either of you.\" I wished I could stick my tongue out at him without being accused of being a big baby. Taylor broke in quickly. She said, \"I picked truth, not dare. That\u0027s why we\u0027re not kissing right now.\" \"We\u0027re not kissing right now because I don\u0027t want to kiss you,\" I told her. I felt flushed, partly because I was mad, and partly because I was flattered. \"Now let\u0027s stop talking about it. It\u0027s your turn to ask.\" \"Fine. Jeremiah. Truth or dare.\" \"Dare,\" he said, leaning against the couch lazily. \"Okay. Kiss somebody in this room, right now .\"Taylor looked at him confidently and waited. It felt like the whole room was sitting on the edge of its seat while we waited for Jeremiah to say something. Would he actually do it? He was not the kind of guy to pass up a dare. I, for one, was curious about what kind of kisser he\u0027d be, if he\u0027d go for a French or if he\u0027d give her a quick peck. I also wondered if it would be their first kiss, or if they\u0027d kissed sometime earlier in the week, like at the arcade when I wasn\u0027t looking, maybe. I was pretty sure they had. Jeremiah sat up straight. \"Easy,\" he said, rubbing his hands together with a smile. Taylor smiled back and tilted her head to the side so her hair fell in her eyes just a little bit. Then he leaned over to me and said, \"Ready?\" and before I could answer, he kissed me right on the lips. His mouth was a little bit open, but it wasn\u0027t a French kiss or anything. I tried to push him off, but he kept on kissing me, for a few more seconds. I pushed him off again, and he leaned back into the couch, as casual as can be. Everyone else was sitting there with their mouths hanging open, except for Conrad, who didn\u0027t even look surprised. But then, he never looked surprised. I, on the other hand, was finding it kind of hard to breathe. I had just had my first kiss. In front of people. In front of my brother. I couldn\u0027t believe that Jeremiah had stolen my first kiss like that. I had been waiting, wanting it to be special, and it had happened during a game of truth or dare. How unspecial could you get? And to top it all off, he had only done it to make Taylor jealous, not because he liked me. It had worked. Her eyes were narrowed, and she was staring at Jeremiah like he had thrown down some kind of gauntlet. Which, I guess he kind of had. \"Gross,\" Steven said. \"This game is gross. I\u0027m outta here.\" Then he looked at all of us disgustedly and left.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-30.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
