{"id":78921,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"As soon as we got inside, I ran up to my room. I wanted to forget what had happened in the car and only remember the way Cam had looked at me, on the stairs with his arm touching my shoulder.\\n\\n Chapter twenty - four\\n\\n The next day, nothing. It wasn\u0027t that he ignored me, because that would have been something. Some kind of proof that it had happened, that something had changed. But no, he treated me the same. Like I was still little Belly, the girl with the messy flyaway ponytail and the bony knees, running after them on the beach. I should have known better.\\n\\n The thing was, whether he was pushing me away or pulling me toward him, I was still going in the same direction. Toward Conrad.\\n\\n Cam didn\u0027t call me for a few days. Not that I blamed him. I didn\u0027t call him either--although I thought about it. I just didn\u0027t know what to say.\\n\\n When he finally called, he didn\u0027t bring up the party. He asked me to go to the drive-in. I said yes. Right away I worried, though--did going to the drive-in mean we were going to have to make out? Like, crazy make out, steamed windows and seats all the way back?\\n\\n Because that was what people did at the drive-in. There were the families, and then there were the hot and heavy couples toward the back of the lot. I\u0027d never been part of a couple before. I\u0027d gone as a family, with Susannah and my mother and everyone, and I\u0027d gone with the boys, but never as a couple, like on a date.\\n\\n Once, Jeremiah and Steven and I went and spied on Conrad on one of his dates. Susannah let Jeremiah drive us, even though he only had a permit. The drive-in was three miles away, and at Cousins, everyone drove, even kids on their parents\u0027 laps. Conrad had been furious when he\u0027d caught us spying on him. He\u0027d been on his way to the concession stand when he saw us. It had been pretty funny--his hair was all messed up as he yelled at us, and his Hps were rosy and they had a glossy sheen. Jeremiah cracked up the whole time.\\n\\n I wished Steven and Jeremiah were out there in the dark somewhere, spying on us and cracking up. It would make me feel comforted somehow. Safer.\\n\\n I was wearing Cam\u0027s hoodie, and I kept it zipped all the way to my neck. I sat with my arms crossed, like I was shivering. Even though I liked Cam, even though I wanted to be there, I had the sudden urge to jump out of the car and walk home. I\u0027d only ever kissed one boy, and that hadn\u0027t been for real. Taylor called me the nun. Maybe I was one, at heart. Maybe I should have joined a convent. I didn\u0027t even know if this was an actual date. Maybe he\u0027d been so turned off by me the other night that all he wanted was to be my friend.\\n\\n Cam tuned the radio until he found the right station. Drumming his hands on the steering wheel, he said, \"Do you want any popcorn or anything?\"\\n\\n I kind of did, but I didn\u0027t want it to get stuck in my teeth, so I said no, thanks.\\n\\n He was pretty into the movie, the way he leaned up close to the windshield to get a closer look sometimes. It was an old horror movie, one that Cam told me was really famous, but I\u0027d never heard of it. I was barely paying attention anyway--I felt like I was watching him way more than I was watching the movie. He licked his lips a lot. He didn\u0027t look over and laugh with me during the funny parts the way Jeremiah did. He just sat on his side of the car, leaned up against the door, as far away from me as possible.\\n\\n When the movie was over, he started the car up. \"Ready?\" he said.\\n\\n I felt a wave of disappointment. He was taking me home already. He wasn\u0027t going to take me to Scoops for an ice cream cone, or a hot fudge sundae to share. The date, if you could even call it that, had been a failure. He didn\u0027t try to make out with me once. Not that I knew if I\u0027d even have let him, but still. He could\u0027ve at least tried.\\n\\n \"Um-hmm,\" I said. I felt like I might cry, and I wasn\u0027t quite sure why, when I hadn\u0027t even been sure if I wanted to kiss him in the first place.\\n\\n We drove home in silence. He parked the car in front of the house--I held my breath a little, my hand on the door handle, waiting to see if he\u0027d turn off the ignition or if I should hop out. But he turned it off and leaned his head back against the headrest a second.\\n\\n \"Do you know why I remembered you?\" he asked me suddenly.\\n\\n It was a question so out of nowhere that it took me a little while to figure out what he was talking about. \"You mean from Latin Convention?\" \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Was it my Coliseum model?\" I was only half-joking. Steven had helped me build it; it had been pretty impressive.\\n\\n \"No.\" Cam ran his hand through his hair. He wouldn\u0027t look at me. \"It\u0027s because I thought you were really pretty. Like, maybe the prettiest girl I\u0027d ever seen.\"\\n\\n I laughed. In the car, it sounded really loud. \"Yeah, right. Nice try, Sextus.\"\\n\\n \"I mean it,\" he insisted, his voice rising.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re making that up.\" I didn\u0027t believe it could be true. I didn\u0027t want to let myself believe it. With the boys any compliment like this would always be the first part of a joke.\\n\\n He shook his head, lips tight. He was offended that I didn\u0027t believe him. I hadn\u0027t meant to hurt his feelings. I just didn\u0027t see how it could be true. It was almost mean of him to lie about it. I knew what I looked like back then, and I wasn\u0027t the prettiest girl anybody had ever seen, not with my thick glasses and chubby cheeks and little-girl body.\\n\\n Cam looked me in the eyes then. \"The first day, you wore a blue dress. It was, like, corduroy or something. It made your eyes look really blue.\"\\n\\n \"My eyes are gray,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes, but that dress made them look blue.\"\\n\\n Which was why I wore it. It was my favorite. I wondered where it was now. Probably packed up in the attic back home, with all my winter clothes. It was too small now anyway.\\n\\n He looked so sweet, the way he watched me, waiting for my reaction. His cheeks were flushed peach. I swallowed hard and said, \"Why didn\u0027t you come up to me?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"You were always with your friends. I watched you that whole week, trying to get up the nerve. I couldn\u0027t believe it when I saw you at the bonfire that night. Pretty bizarre, huh?\" Cam laughed, but he sounded embarrassed.\\n\\n \"Pretty bizarre,\" I echoed. I couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d noticed me. With Taylor by my side, who would have even bothered to look at me?\\n\\n \"I almost messed up my Catullus speech on purpose, so you\u0027d win,\" he said, remembering. He inched a little closer to me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t,\" I said. I reached out and touched his arm. My hand shook. \"I wish you had come up to me.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s when he dipped his head low and kissed me. I didn\u0027t let go of the door handle. All I could think was, J wish this had been my first kiss.\\n\\n Chapter twenty - five\\n\\n When I went into the house, I was walking on cotton candy and clouds, replaying everything that had just happened--until I heard my mother and Susannah arguing in the living room. Fear seized up inside of me; it felt like a fist clenched tight around my heart. They never fought, not really. I\u0027d only ever seen them fight one time. It was last summer. The three of us had gone shopping to this fancy mall an hour away from Cousins. It was an outdoor mall, the kind where people bring their pocket-size dogs on fancy leashes. I saw this dress--it was a purpley plum chiffon, with little off the shoulder straps, way too old for me. I loved it. Susannah said I should try it on, just for fun, so I did. She took one look at me and said I had to have it. My mother shook her head right away. She said, \"She\u0027s fourteen. Where will she wear a dress like that?\" Susannah said it didn\u0027t matter, that it was made for me. I knew we couldn\u0027t afford it, my mother was newly divorced, after all, but I still pleaded with her. I begged. They got into an argument right there in the boutique, in front of people. Susannah wanted to buy it for me, and my mother wouldn\u0027t let her. I told them never mind, I didn\u0027t want it, even though I did. I knew my mother was right, I\u0027d never wear it. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-27.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
