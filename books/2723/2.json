I leaned over Steven and honked the horn twice, which in our summer language meant, Come help with the bags, stat Conrad was eighteen now. He\u0027d just had a birthday. He was taller than last summer, if you can believe it. His hair was cut short around his ears and was as dark as ever. Unlike Jeremiah\u0027s, whose hair had gotten longer, so he looked a little shaggy but in a good way--like a 1970s tennis player. When he was younger, it was curly yellow, almost platinum in the summer. Jeremiah hated his curls. For a while, Conrad had him convinced that crusts made\n your hair curly, so Jeremiah had stopped eating sandwich crusts, and Conrad would polish them off. As Jeremiah got older, though, his hair was less and less curly and more wavy. I missed his curls. Susannah called him her little angel, and he used to look like one, with his rosy cheeks and yellow curls. He still had the rosy cheeks.\n Jeremiah made a megaphone with his hands and yelled, \"Steve-o!\"\n I sat in the car and watched Steven amble up to them and hug the way guys do. The air smelled salty and wet, like it might rain seawater any second. I pretended to be tying the laces on my sneakers, but really I just wanted a moment to look at them, at the house for a little while, in private. The house was large and gray and white, and it looked like most every other house on the road, but better. It looked just the way I thought a beach house should look. It looked like home.\n My mother got out of the car then too. \"Hey, boys. Where\u0027s your mother?\" she called out.\n \"Hey, Laurel. She\u0027s taking a nap,\" Jeremiah called back. Usually she came flying out of the house the second our car pulled up.\n My mother walked over to them in about three strides, and she hugged them both, tightly. My mother\u0027s hug was as firm and solid as her handshake. She disappeared into the house with her sunglasses perched on the top of her head.\n I got out of the car and slung my bag over my shoulder. They didn\u0027t even notice me walk up at first. But then they did. They really did. Conrad gave me a quick glance-over the way boys do at the mall. He had never looked at me like that before in my whole life. Not once. I could feel my flush from the car return. Jeremiah, on the other hand, did a double take. He looked at me like he didn\u0027t even recognize me. All of this happened in the span of about three seconds, but it felt much, much longer.\n Conrad hugged me first, but a faraway kind of hug, careful not to get too close. He\u0027d just gotten a haircut, and the skin around the nape of his neck looked pink and new, like a baby\u0027s. He smelled like the ocean. He smelled like Conrad. \"I liked you better with glasses,\" he said, his lips close to my ear.\n That stung. I shoved him away and said, \"Well, too bad. My contacts are here to stay.\"\n He smiled at me, and that smile--he just gets in. His smile did it every time. \"I think you got a few new ones,\" he said, tapping me on the nose. He knew how self-conscious I was about my freckles and he still teased me every time.\n Then Jeremiah grabbed me next, and he almost lifted me into the air. \"Belly Button\u0027s all growed up,\" he crowed.\n I laughed. \"Put me down,\" I told him. \"You smell like BO.\" Jeremiah laughed loudly. \"Same old Belly,\" he said, but he was staring at me like he wasn\u0027t quite sure who I was.\n He cocked his head and said, \"Something looks different about you, Belly.\"\n I braced myself for the punch line. \"What? I got contacts.\" I wasn\u0027t completely used to myself without glasses either. My best friend Taylor had been trying to convince me to get contacts since the sixth grade, and I\u0027d finally listened.\n He smiled. \"It\u0027s not that. You just look different.\"\n I went back to the car then, and the boys followed me. We unloaded the car quickly, and as soon as we were done, I picked up my suitcase and my book bag and headed straight for my old bedroom. My room was Susannah\u0027s from when she was a child. It had faded calico wallpaper and a white bedroom set. There was a music box I loved. When you opened it, there was a twirling ballerina that danced to the theme song from Romeo and Juliet , the old-timey version. I kept my jewelry in it. Everything about my room was old and faded, but I loved that about it. It felt like there might be secrets in the walls, in the four-poster bed, especially in that music box.\n Seeing Conrad again, having him look at me that way, I felt like I needed a second to breathe. I grabbed the stuffed polar bear on my dresser and hugged him close to my chest--his name was Junior Mint, Junior for short. I sat down with Junior on my twin bed. My heart was beating so loudly I could hear it. Everything was the same but not. They had looked at me like I was a real girl, not just somebody\u0027s little sister.\n Chapter two\n AGE 12\n The first time I ever had my heart broken was at this house. I was twelve.\n It was one of those really rare nights when the boys weren\u0027t all together--Steven and Jeremiah went on an overnight fishing trip with some boys they\u0027d met at the arcade. Conrad said he didn\u0027t feel like going, and of course I wasn\u0027t invited, so it was just me and him.\n Well, not together, but in the same house.\n I was reading a romance novel in my room with my feet on the wall when Conrad walked by. He stopped and said, \"Belly, what are you doing tonight?\"\n I folded the cover of my book over quickly. \"Nothing,\" I said. I tried to keep my voice even, not too excited or eager. I had left my door open on purpose, hoping he\u0027d stop by.\n \"Want to go to the boardwalk with me?\" he asked. He sounded casual, almost too casual.\n This was the moment I had been waiting for. This was it. I was finally old enough. Some part of me knew it too, it was ready. I glanced over at him, just as casual as he\u0027d been. \"Maybe. I have been craving a caramel apple.\"\n \"I\u0027ll buy one for you,\" he offered. \"Just hurry up and put some clothes on and we\u0027ll go. Our moms are going to the movies; they\u0027ll drop us off on the way.\"\n I sat up and said, \"Okay.\"\n As soon as Conrad left, I closed my door and ran over to my mirror. I took my hair out of its braids and brushed it. It was long that summer, almost to my waist. Then I changed out of my bathing suit and put on white shorts and my favorite gray shirt. My dad said it matched my eyes. I smeared some strawberry frosting lip gloss on my lips and tucked the tube into my pocket, for later. In case I needed to reapply.\n In the car Susannah kept smiling at me in the rearview mirror. I gave her a look like, Quit, please--but I wanted to smile back. Conrad wasn\u0027t paying attention anyway. He was looking out the window the whole ride there.\n \"Have fun, kids,\" said Susannah, winking at me as I closed my door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-2.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Belly measures her life in summers.
