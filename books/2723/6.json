It was a constant reminder that I was different, that I wasn\u0027t one of them. Little things have changed, though. It used to be that they left water all over the place, either from splash fights or from just being careless. Now that they shaved, they left their little chin hairs all over the sink. The counter was crowded with their different deodorants and shaving cream and cologne.\n They had more cologne than I had perfume--one pink French bottle my dad bought me for Christmas when I was thirteen. It smelled like vanilla and burnt sugar and lemon. I think his grad student girlfriend picked it out. He wasn\u0027t good at that sort of thing. Anyway, I didn\u0027t leave my perfume in the bathroom mixed in with all their stuff. I kept it on the dresser in my room, and I never wore it anyway. I didn\u0027t know why I even brought it with me.\n Chapter eight\n After dinner I stayed downstairs on the couch and so did Conrad. He sat there across from me, strumming chords on his guitar with his head bent.\n \"So I heard you have a girlfriend,\" I said. \"I heard it\u0027s pretty serious.\"\n \"My brother has a big mouth.\" About a month before we\u0027d left for Cousins, Jeremiah had called Steven. They were on the phone for a while, and I hid outside Steven\u0027s bedroom door listening. Steven didn\u0027t say a whole lot on his end, but it seemed like a serious conversation. I burst into his room and asked him what they were talking about, and Steven accused me of being a nosy little spy, and then he finally told me that Conrad had a girlfriend.\n \"So what\u0027s she like?\" I didn\u0027t look at him when I said this. I was afraid he\u0027d be able to see how much I cared.\n Conrad cleared his throat. \"We broke up,\" he said.\n I almost gasped. My heart did a little ping. \"Your mom is right, you are a heartbreaker.\" I meant it to come out as a joke, but the words rang in my head and in the air like some kind of declaration.\n He flinched. \"She dumped me,\" he said flatly.\n I couldn\u0027t imagine anyone breaking up with Conrad. I wondered what she was like. Suddenly she was this compelling, actual person in my mind. \"What was her name?\"\n \"What does it matter?\" he said, his voice rough. Then, \"Aubrey. Her name is Aubrey.\"\n \"Why did she break up with you?\" I couldn\u0027t help myself. I was too curious. Who was this girl? I pictured someone with pale white blond hair and turquoise eyes, someone with perfect cuticles and oval-shaped nails. I\u0027d always had to keep mine short for piano, and then after I quit, I still kept them short, because I was used to them that way.\n Conrad put down the guitar and stared off into space moodily. \"She said I changed.\" \"And did you?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Everybody changes. You did.\" \"How did I change?\"\n He shrugged and picked up his guitar again. \"Like I said, everybody changes.\"\n Conrad started playing the guitar in middle school. I hated it when he played the guitar. He\u0027d sit there, strumming, halfway paying attention, only halfway present. He\u0027d hum to himself, and he was someplace else. We\u0027d be watching TV, or playing cards, and he\u0027d be strumming the guitar. Or he\u0027d be in his room, practicing. For what, I didn\u0027t know. All I knew was that it took time away from us.\n \"Listen to this,\" he\u0027d said once, stretching out his headphones so I had one and he had the other. Our heads touched. \"Isn\u0027t it amazing?\"\n \"It\" was Pearl Jam. Conrad was as happy and enthralled as if he had discovered them himself. I\u0027d never heard of them, but at that moment, it was the best song I\u0027d ever heard. I went out and bought Ten and listened to it on repeat. When I listened to track five, \"Black,\" it was like I was there, in that moment all over again.\n After the summer was over, when I got back home, I went to the music store and bought the sheet music and learned to play it on the piano. I thought one day I could accompany Conrad and we could be, like, a band. Which was so stupid, the summer house didn\u0027t even have a piano. Susannah tried to get one for the summer house, so I could practice, but my mother wouldn\u0027t let her.\n Chapter nine\n At night when I couldn\u0027t sleep, I\u0027d sneak downstairs and go for a swim in the pool. I\u0027d start doing laps, and I\u0027d keep going until I felt tired. When I went to bed, my muscles felt nice and sore but also shivery and relaxed. I loved bundling myself up after a swim in one of Susannah\u0027s cornflower blue bath sheets--I\u0027d never even heard of bath sheets before Susannah. And then, tiptoeing back upstairs, falling asleep with my hair still wet. You sleep so well after you\u0027ve been in the water. It\u0027s like no other feeling.\n Two summers ago Susannah found me down there, and some nights she\u0027d swim with me. I\u0027d be underwater, doing my laps, and I\u0027d feel her dive in and start to swim on the other side of the pool. We wouldn\u0027t talk; we\u0027d just swim, but it was comforting to have her there. It was the only time that summer that I ever saw her without her wig.\n Back then, because of the chemo, Susannah wore her wig all the time. No one saw her without it, not even my mother. Susannah had had the prettiest hair. Long, caramel-colored, soft as cotton candy. Her wig didn\u0027t even compare, and it was real human hair and everything, the best money could buy. After the chemo, after her hair grew back, she kept it short, cut right below her chin. It was pretty, but it wasn\u0027t the same. Looking at her now, you\u0027d never know who she used to be, with her hair long like a teenager, like mine.\n That first night of the summer, I couldn\u0027t sleep. It always took me a night or two to get used to my bed again, even though I\u0027d slept in it pretty much every summer of my life. I tossed and turned for a while, and then I couldn\u0027t stand it anymore. I put on my bathing suit, my old swim team one that barely fit anymore, with the gold stripes and the racerback. It was my first night swim of the summer.\n When I swam alone at night, everything felt so much clearer. Listening to myself breathe in and out, it made me feel calm and steady and strong. Like I could swim forever.\n I swam back and forth a few times, and on the fourth lap, I started to flip turn, but I kicked something solid. I came up for air and saw it was Conrad\u0027s leg. He was sitting on the edge of the pool with his feet dangling in.\n He\u0027d been watching me that whole time. And he was smoking a cigarette.\n I stayed underwater up to my chin--I was suddenly aware of how my bathing suit was too small for me now. There was no way I was getting out of the water with him still there.\n \"Since when did you start smoking?\" I asked accusingly. \"And what are you doing down here anyway?\"\n \"Which do you want me to answer first?\" He had that amused, condescending Conrad look on his face, the one that drove me crazy. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-6.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Belly measures her life in summers.
