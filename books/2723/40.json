Practically my brother. The hugeness of it all made it hard to breathe. I could barely look at him. Because I didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t see him that way. There was only one person. For me that person was Conrad. \"And I know you\u0027ve always liked Conrad, but you\u0027re over him now, right?\" His eyes looked so hopeful, it killed me, killed me to not answer him the way he wanted me to. \"I ... I don\u0027t know,\" I whispered. He sucked in his breath, the way he did when he was frustrated. \"But why? He doesn\u0027t see you that way. I do.\" I could feel my eyes starting to tear up, which wasn\u0027t fair. I couldn\u0027t cry. It was just that he was right. Conrad didn\u0027t see me that way. I only wished I could see Jeremiah the way he saw me. \"I know. I wish I didn\u0027t. But I do. I still do.\" Jeremiah moved away from me. He wouldn\u0027t look at me; his eyes looked everywhere but at mine. \"He\u0027ll only end up hurting you,\" he said, and his voice cracked. \"I\u0027m so, so sorry. Please don\u0027t be mad at me. I couldn\u0027t take it if you were mad at me.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027m not mad at you. I\u0027m just--why does it always have to be Conrad?\" Then he got up, and left me sitting there. Chapter forty one AGE 12 Mr. Fisher had taken the boys on one of their overnight deep-sea fishing trips. Jeremiah couldn\u0027t go; he\u0027d been sick earlier that day so Susannah made him stay home. The two of us spent the night on the old plaid couch in the basement eating chips and dip and watching movies. In between The Terminator and Terminator 2, Jeremiah said bitterly, \"He likes Con better than me, you know.\" I had gotten up to change the DVDs, and I turned around and said, \"Huh?\" \"It\u0027s true. I don\u0027t really care anyway. I think he\u0027s a dick,\" Jeremiah said, picking at a thread on the flannel blanket in his lap. I thought he was kind of a dick too, but I didn\u0027t say so. You\u0027re not supposed to join in when someone is bashing his father. I just put the DVD in and sat back down. Taking a corner of the blanket, I said, \"He\u0027s not so bad.\" Jeremiah gave me a look. \"He is, and you know it. Con thinks he\u0027s God or something. So does your brother.\" \"It\u0027s just that your dad is so different from our dad,\" I said defensively. \"Your dad takes you guys fishing and, like, plays football with you. Our dad doesn\u0027t do that kind of stuff. He likes chess.\" He shrugged. \"I like chess.\" I hadn\u0027t known that about him. I liked it too. My dad had taught me to play when I was seven. I wasn\u0027t bad either. I had never joined chess club, even though I\u0027d kind of wanted to. Chess club was for the nose-pickers. That\u0027s what Taylor called them. \"And Conrad likes chess too,\" Jeremiah said. \"He just tries to be what our dad wants. And the thing is, I don\u0027t even think he likes football, not like I do. He\u0027s just good at it like he is at everything.\" There was nothing I could say to that. Conrad was good at everything. I grabbed a handful of chips and stuffed them into my mouth so I wouldn\u0027t have to say anything. \"One day I\u0027m gonna be better than him,\" Jeremiah said. I didn\u0027t see that happening. Conrad was too good. \"I know you like Conrad,\" Jeremiah said suddenly. I swallowed the chips. They tasted like rabbit feed all of a sudden. \"No, I don\u0027t,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t like Conrad.\" \"Yes, you do,\" he said, and his eyes looked so knowing and wise. \"Tell the truth. No secrets, remember?\" No secrets was something Jeremiah and I had been saying for pretty much forever. It was a tradition, the same way Jeremiah\u0027s drinking my sweet cereal milk was tradition-- just one of those things we said to each other when it was just the two of us. \"No, I really don\u0027t like him,\" I insisted. \"I like him like a friend. I don\u0027t look at him like that.\" \"Yes, you do. You look at him like you love him.\" I couldn\u0027t take those knowing eyes looking at me for one more second. Hotly I said, \"You just think that because you\u0027re jealous of anything Conrad does.\" \"I\u0027m not jealous. I just wish I could be as good as him,\" he said softly. Then he burped and turned the movie on. The thing was, Jeremiah was right. I did love him. I knew the exact moment it became real too. Conrad got up early to make a special belated Father\u0027s Day breakfast, only Mr. Fisher hadn\u0027t been able to come down the night before. He wasn\u0027t there the next morning the way he was supposed to be. Conrad cooked anyway, and he was thirteen and a terrible cook, but we all ate it. Watching him serving rubbery eggs and pretending not to be sad, I thought to myself, I will love this boy forever. Chapter forty -two He\u0027d gone running on the beach, something he\u0027d started doing recently--I knew because I\u0027d watched him from my window two mornings in a row. He was wearing gym shorts and a T-shirt; sweat had formed in a circle in the middle of his back. He\u0027d left about an hour before, I\u0027d seen him take off, and he was running back to the house now. I walked out there, to the porch, without a real plan in my mind. All I knew was that the summer was almost over. Soon it would be too late. We would drive away, and I would never have told him. Jeremiah had laid it all out on the line. Now it was my turn. I couldn\u0027t go another whole year not having told him. I\u0027d been so afraid of change, of anything tipping our little summer sailboat--but Jeremiah had already done that, and look, we were still alive. We were still Belly and Jeremiah. I had to, I had to do it, because to not do it would kill me. I couldn\u0027t keep yearning for something, for someone who might or might not like me back. I had to know for sure. Now or never. He didn\u0027t hear me coming up behind him. He was bent down loosening the laces of his sneakers. \"Conrad,\" I said. He didn\u0027t hear me, so I said it again, louder. \"Conrad.\" He looked up, startled. Then he stood up straight. Catching him off guard felt like a good sign. He had a million walls. Maybe if I just started talking, he wouldn\u0027t have time to build up a new one. I sucked in my lips and began to speak. I said the first words I thought of, the ones that had been on my heart since the beginning. I said, \"I\u0027ve loved you since I was ten years old.\" He blinked. \"You\u0027re the only boy I\u0027ve ever thought about. My whole life, it\u0027s always been you. You taught me how to dance, you came out and got me the time I swam out too far. Do you remember that? You stayed with me and you pushed me back to shore, and the whole time, you kept saying, \u0027We\u0027re almost there,\u0027 and I believed it. I believed it because you were the one","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-40.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
