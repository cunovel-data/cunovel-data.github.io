If I had been paying attention, it would have been different.\"\\n\\n Jeremiah shook his head. \"She didn\u0027t want you to know.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t want any of us to know. She wanted it to be like this, so we pretended. For her. But I wish I could have told you. It might have been easier or something.\" He wiped his eyes with his T-shirt collar, and I could see him trying so hard to keep it together, to be the strong one.\\n\\n I reached for him, to hug him, and he shuddered, and something seemed to break inside of him. He began to cry, really cry, but quietly. We cried together, our shoulders shaking and shuddering with the weight of all of it. We cried like that for a long time. When we stopped, he let go of me and wiped his nose.\\n\\n \"Scoot over,\" I said.\\n\\n He scooted closer to the wall, and I stretched my legs out next to him. \"I\u0027m sleeping in here, okay,\" I said, but it wasn\u0027t a question.\\n\\n Jeremiah nodded and we slept like that, in our clothes on top of the comforter. Even though we were older, it felt just the same. We slept face-to-face, the way we used to.\\n\\n I woke up early the next morning clinging to the side of the bed. Jeremiah was sprawled out and snoring. I covered him with my side of the comforter, so he was tucked in like with a sleeping bag. Then I left.\\n\\n I headed back to my room, and I had my hand on the doorknob when I heard Conrad\u0027s voice. \"Goood morning,\" he said. I knew right away he\u0027d seen me leave Jeremiah\u0027s room.\\n\\n Slowly I turned around. And there he was. He was standing there in last night\u0027s clothes, just like me. He looked rumpled, and he swayed just slightly. He looked like he was going to throw up.\\n\\n \"Are you drunk?\"\\n\\n He shrugged like he couldn\u0027t care less, but his shoulders were tense and rigid. Snidely he said, \"Aren\u0027t you supposed to be nice to me now? Like the way you were for Jere last night?\"\\n\\n I opened my mouth to defend myself, to say that nothing had happened, that all we\u0027d done was cry ourselves to sleep. But I didn\u0027t want to. Conrad didn\u0027t deserve to know anything. \"You\u0027re the most selfish person I ever met,\" I said slowly and deliberately. I let each word puncture the air. I had never wanted to hurt somebody so bad in my whole life. \"I can\u0027t believe I ever thought I loved you.\"\\n\\n His face turned white. He opened and then closed his mouth. And then he did it again. I\u0027d never seen him at a loss for words before.\\n\\n I walked back to my room. It was the first time I\u0027d ever gotten the last word with Conrad. I had done it. I had finally let him go. It felt like freedom, but freedom bought at some bloody, terrible price. It didn\u0027t feel good. Did I even have a right to say those things to him, with him hurting the way he was? Did I have any rights to him at all? He was in pain, and so was I.\\n\\n When I got back into bed, I got under the covers and cried some more, and here I was thinking I didn\u0027t have any more tears left. Everything was wrong.\\n\\n How could it be that I had spent this whole summer worrying about boys, swimming, and getting tan, while Susannah was sick? How could that be? The thought of life without Susannah felt impossible. It was inconceivable; I couldn\u0027t even picture it. I couldn\u0027t imagine what it would be like for Jeremiah and Conrad. She was their mother.\\n\\n Later that morning I didn\u0027t get out of bed. I slept until eleven, and then I just stayed there. I was afraid to go downstairs and face Susannah and have her see that I knew.\\n\\n Around noon my mother bustled into my room without even knocking. \"Rise and shine,\" she said, surveying my mess. She picked up a pair of shorts and a T-shirt and folded them against her chest.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not ready to get out of bed yet,\" I told her, turning over. I felt mad at her, like I had been tricked. She should have told me. She should have warned me. My whole life, I had never known my mother to lie. But she had. All those times when they\u0027d supposedly been shopping, or at the museum, on day trips--they hadn\u0027t been any of those places. They\u0027d been at hospitals, with doctors. I saw that now. I just wished I had seen it before.\\n\\n My mother walked over to me and sat on the edge of my bed. She scratched my back, and her fingernails felt good against my skin. \"You have to get out of bed, Belly,\" she said softly. \"You\u0027re still alive and so is Susannah. You have to be strong for her. She needs you.\"\\n\\n Her words made sense. If Susannah needed me, then that was something I could do. \"I can do that,\" I said, turning around to look at her. \"I just don\u0027t get how Mr. Fisher can leave her all alone like this when she needs him most.\"\\n\\n She looked away, out the window, and then back down at me. \"This is the way Beck wants things to be. And Adam is who he is.\" She cradled my cheek in her hand. \"It\u0027s not up to us to decide.\"\\n\\n Susannah was in the kitchen making blueberry muffins. She was leaning up against the counter, stirring batter in a big metal mixing bowl. She was wearing another one of her cotton housedresses, and I realized she\u0027d been wearing them all summer, because they were loose. They hid how thin her arms were, the way her collarbone jutted up against her skin.\\n\\n She hadn\u0027t seen me yet, and I was tempted to run away before she did. But I didn\u0027t. I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Susannah,\" I said, and my voice sounded high and false, not like my own.\\n\\n She looked up at me and smiled. \"It\u0027s past noon. I don\u0027t think it counts as morning anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Good afternoon, then.\" I lingered by the door.\\n\\n \"Are you mad at me too?\" she asked me lightly. Her eyes were worried, though.\\n\\n \"I could never be mad at you,\" I told her, coming up behind her and putting my arms around her stomach. I tucked my head in the space between her neck and her shoulder. She smelled like flowers.\\n\\n She said, still in her light voice, \"You\u0027ll look after him, won\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Who?\"\\n\\n I could feel her cheeks form into a smile. \"You know who.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I whispered, still holding on tight. \"Good,\" she said, sighing. \"He needs you.\" I didn\u0027t ask who \"he\" was. I didn\u0027t need to. \"Susannah?\" \"Hmm?\"\\n\\n \"Promise me something.\" \"Anything.\"\\n\\n \"Promise me you\u0027ll never leave.\" \"I promise,\" she said without hesitation. I let out a breath, and then I let go. \"Can I help you with the muffins?\" \"Yes, please.\"\\n\\n I helped her make a streusel topping with brown sugar and butter and oats. We took the muffins out of the oven too early, because we couldn\u0027t stand to wait, and we ate them while they were still steaming hot and gooey in the middle. I ate three. Sitting with her, watching her butter her muffin, it felt like she\u0027d be there forever. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-43.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
