{"id":78939,"no":45,"title":"Page 45","content":"I finally understood Conrad. I mean, I understood what he meant when he said he couldn\u0027t deal with any of it--with me. I couldn\u0027t either. All I wanted to do was spend every single second at the house, with Susannah. To soak up the last drop of summer and pretend it was like all the summers that had come before it. That was all I wanted.\n Chapter forty -five\n I hated the last day before we left, because it was cleanup day, and when we were kids, we weren\u0027t allowed to go to the beach at all, in case we brought in more sand. We washed all the sheets and swept up the sand, made sure all the boogie boards and floats were in the basement, cleaned out the fridge and packed sandwiches for the drive home. My mother was at the helm of this day. She was the one who insisted everything be just so. \"So it\u0027s all ready for next summer,\" she\u0027d say. What she didn\u0027t know was that Susannah had cleaners come in after we left and before we came back.\n I caught Susannah calling them once, scheduling an appointment. She covered the phone with one hand and whispered guiltily, \"Don\u0027t tell your mom, okay, Belly?\"\n I nodded. It was like a secret between us, and I liked that. My mother actually liked to clean and didn\u0027t believe in housekeepers or maids or in other people doing what she considered our work. She\u0027d say, \"Would you ask someone else to brush your teeth for you, or lace up your shoes, just because you could? \"The answer was no.\n \"Don\u0027t worry too much about the sand,\" Susannah would whisper when she\u0027d see me going over the kitchen floor with a broom for the third time. I would keep sweeping anyway. I knew what my mother would say if she felt any grains on her feet.\n That night for dinner we ate everything that was left in the fridge. That was the tradition. My mother heated up two frozen pizzas, reheated lo mein and fried rice, made a salad out of pale celery and tomatoes. There was clam chowder too, and half a rack of ribs, plus Susannah\u0027s potato salad from more than a week before. It was a smorgasbord of old food that no one felt like eating.\n But we did. We sat around the kitchen table picking off of foil-covered plates. Conrad kept sneaking looks at me, and every time I looked back, he looked away. I\u0027m right here, I wanted to tell him. I\u0027m still here.\n We were all pretty quiet until Jeremiah broke the silence like breaking the top of a cr√®me brulee. He said, \"This potato salad tastes like bad breath.\"\n \"I think that would be your upper lip,\" Conrad said.\n We all laughed, and it felt like a relief. For it to be okay to laugh. To be something other than sad.\n Then Conrad said, \"This rib has mold on it,\" and we all started to laugh again. It felt like I hadn\u0027t laughed in a long time.\n My mother rolled her eyes. \"Would it kill you to eat a little mold? Just scrape it off. Give it to me. I\u0027ll eat it.\"\n Conrad put his hands up in surrender, and then he stabbed the rib with his fork and dropped it on my mother\u0027s plate ceremoniously. \"Enjoy it, Laurel.\"\n \"I swear, you spoil these boys, Beck,\u0027\u0027 my mother said, and everything felt normal, like any other last night. \"Belly was raised on leftovers, weren\u0027t you, bean?\"\n \"I was,\" I agreed. \"I was a neglected child who was fed only old food that nobody else wanted.\"\n My mother suppressed a smile and pushed the potato salad toward me.\n \"I do spoil them,\" Susannah said, touching Conrad\u0027s shoulder, Jeremiah\u0027s cheek. \"They\u0027re angels. Why shouldn\u0027t I?\"\n The two boys looked at each other from across the table for a second. Then Conrad said, \"I\u0027m an angel. I would say Jere\u0027s more of a cherub.\" He reached out and tousled Jeremiah\u0027s hair roughly.\n Jeremiah swatted his hand away. \"He\u0027s no angel. He\u0027s the devil,\" he said. It was like the fight had been erased. With boys it was like that; they fought and then it was over.\n My mother picked up Conrad\u0027s rib, looked down at it, and then put it down again. \"I can\u0027t eat this,\" she said, sighing.\n \"Mold won\u0027t kill you,\" Susannah declared, laughing and pushing her hair out of her eyes. She lifted her fork in the air. \"You know what will?\"\n We all stared at her.\n \"Cancer,\" she said triumphantly. She had the best poker face known to man. She held a straight face for four whole seconds before erupting into a fit of giggles. She rustled her hand through Conrad\u0027s hair until he finally wore a smile. I could tell he didn\u0027t want to, but he did it. For her.\n \"Listen up,\" she said. \"Here\u0027s what\u0027s going to happen. I\u0027m seeing my acupuncturist, I\u0027m taking medicine, I\u0027m still fighting this the best I can. My doctor says that at this point that\u0027s the most I can do. I refuse to put any more poison into my body or spend any more time in hospitals. This is where I want to be. With the people who matter most to me. Okay?\" She looked around at us.\n \"Okay.\" We all said it, even though it was in no way, shape, or form okay. Nor would it ever be.\n Susannah continued. \"If and when I go off slow dancing in the ever after, I don\u0027t want to look like I\u0027ve been stuck in a hospital room my whole life. I at least want to be tan. I want to be as tan as Belly.\" She pointed at me with her fork.\n \"Beck, if you want to be as tan as Belly, you\u0027ll need more time. That\u0027s not something you can achieve in one summer. My girl wasn\u0027t born tan; it takes years. And you\u0027re not ready yet,\" my mother said. She said it simply, logically.\n Susannah wasn\u0027t ready yet. None of us were.\n After dinner we all went our separate ways to pack. The house was quiet, too quiet. I stayed in my bedroom, packing up clothes, my shoes, my books. Until it was time to pack my bathing suit. I wasn\u0027t ready to do that yet. I wanted one more swim.\n I changed into my one-piece and wrote two notes, one for Jeremiah and one for Conrad. On each of them I wrote, \"Midnight swim. Meet me in ten minutes.\" I slid a note under each door and then ran downstairs as quick as I could with my towel streaming behind me like a flag. I couldn\u0027t let the summer end like this. We couldn\u0027t leave this house until we had one good moment, for all of us.\n The house was dark, and I made my way outside without turning on the lights. I didn\u0027t need to. I knew it by heart.\n As soon as I got outside, I dove into the pool. I didn\u0027t dive so much as belly flop. The last one of the summer, maybe ever--in this house, anyway. The moon was bright and white, and as I waited for the boys, I floated on my back counting stars and listening to the ocean. When the tide was low like this, it whispered and gurgled and it sounded like a lullaby. I wished I could stay forever, in this moment. Like in one of those plastic snowballs, one little moment frozen in time.\n They came out together, Beck\u0027s boys. I guessed they\u0027d run into each other on the stairs. They were both wearing their swimming trunks. It occurred to me that I hadn\u0027t seen Conrad in his trunks all summer, that we hadn\u0027t swum in this pool since that first day. And Jeremiah, we\u0027d only swum in the ocean once or twice. It had been a summer with hardly any swim time, except for when I swam with Cam or when I swam alone. The thought made me feel unspeakably sad, that this could be the last summer and we\u0027d hardly swum together at all. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-45.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Belly measures her life in summers.
