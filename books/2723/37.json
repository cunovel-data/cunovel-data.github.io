His cheek was stubbly and it felt kind of rough but nice.\\n\\n When it was over, he said, \"Okay?\"\\n\\n I smiled and said, \"Okay.\" I unbuckled my seat belt. \"Good night.\"\\n\\n Then I got out of the car, and he came around and took the driver\u0027s seat. We hugged, and I found myself wishing that Conrad was watching. Even though it didn\u0027t matter, even though I didn\u0027t even like him anymore. I just wanted him to know I didn\u0027t like him anymore, to really know it. To see it with his own two eyes.\\n\\n I ran up to the front door, and I didn\u0027t have to turn around to know that Cam would wait until I was inside before he drove away.\\n\\n The next day my mother didn\u0027t mention anything, but she didn\u0027t have to. She could make me feel guilty without saying a word.\\n\\n Chapter thirty - six\\n\\n My birthday always marked the beginning of the end of summer. It was my final thing to look forward to. And this summer I was turning sixteen. Sweet sixteen was supposed to be special, a really big deal--Taylor was renting out a reception hall for hers, and her cousin was DJ-ing and she was inviting the whole school. She\u0027d had it planned for ages. My birthdays here were always the same: cake; gag gifts from the boys; and looking through all the old photo albums, with me sandwiched between Susannah and my mom on the couch. Every birthday I\u0027ve ever had has been here, in this house. There are pictures of my mother sitting on the porch pregnant, with a glass of iced tea and a wide brimmed hat, and there\u0027s me, inside her belly. There are pictures of the four of us, Conrad, Steven, Jeremiah, and me, running around on the beach--I was na**d except for my birthday hat, chasing after them. My mother didn\u0027t put me in a bathing suit until I was four years old. She just let me run around wild.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t expect this birthday to be any different. Which, was comforting and also kind of depressing. Except, Steven wouldn\u0027t be there--my first birthday without him trying to elbow in and blow out my candles before I could.\\n\\n I already knew what my parents were giving me: Steven\u0027s old car; they were getting it detailed with a new paint job and everything. When I got back to school, I would take driver\u0027s ed, and soon I wouldn\u0027t have to ask for a ride ever again.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if anyone back home remembered it was my birthday. Besides Taylor. She remembered; she always did. She called me at exactly 9:02 in the morning to sing happy birthday, every year. That was nice and all, but the trouble with having a summer birthday and being away was you couldn\u0027t have a party with all your school friends. You didn\u0027t get the balloons taped to your locker or any of it. I\u0027d never really minded, but just then I did, a little.\\n\\n My mother told me I could invite Cam over. But I didn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t even tell him it was my birthday. I didn\u0027t want him to feel like he had to do something. But it was more than that. I figured that if this birthday was going to be like every other one, I might as well really have it be like every other one. It should just be us, my summer family.\\n\\n When I woke up that morning, the house smelled like butter and sugar. Susannah had baked a birthday cake. It was three layers and it was pink with a white border. She wrote in loopy white frosting happy birthday, bells . She\u0027d lit a few sparkler candles on top, and they sizzled and sparked like mad fireflies. She and my mother started to sing, and Susannah gestured for Conrad and Jeremiah to join in. They both did, off-key and obnoxious.\\n\\n \"Make a wish, Belly,\" my mother said.\\n\\n I was still in my pajamas, and I couldn\u0027t stop smiling. The past four birthdays I had wished for the same thing. Not this year. This year I would wish for something else. I watched the sparklers die down, and then I closed my eyes and blew.\\n\\n \"Open my present first,\" Susannah urged. She thrust a small box wrapped in pink paper into my hands.\\n\\n My mother looked at her questioningly. \"What did you do, Beck?\"\\n\\n She smiled a mysterious smile and squeezed my wrist. \"Open it, honey.\"\\n\\n I ripped the paper off and opened the box. It was a pearl necklace, a whole strand of tiny creamy white pearls with a shiny gold clasp. It looked old, not like something you could buy today. It was like my fathers Swiss grandfather clock, beautifully crafted, right down to the clasp. It was the prettiest thing I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n \"Oh my gosh,\" I breathed, lifting it up.\\n\\n I looked at Susannah, who was beaming, and then at my mother, who I thought would say it was much too extravagant, but she didn\u0027t. She smiled and said, \"Are those--\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" Susannah turned to me and said, \"My father gave me those for my sixteenth birthday. I want you to have them.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" I looked back at my mother, to make sure it was okay. She nodded. \"Wow, thank you, Susannah. They\u0027re beautiful.\"\\n\\n She took them from me and fastened them around my neck. I\u0027d never worn pearls before. I couldn\u0027t stop touching them.\\n\\n Susannah clapped her hands. She didn\u0027t like to linger too much after she\u0027d given a gift; she just enjoyed the giving of it. \"Okay, what\u0027s next? Jeremiah? Con?\"\\n\\n Conrad shifted uncomfortably. \"I forgot. Sorry, Belly.\"\\n\\n I blinked. He\u0027d never forgotten my birthday before. \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t even look at him.\\n\\n \"Open mine next,\" Jeremiah said. \"Although, after that, mine kind of sucks in comparison. Thanks a lot, Mom.\" He handed me a small box and leaned back in his chair.\\n\\n I shook the box. \"Okay, what could it be? Plastic poop? A license plate key chain?\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"You\u0027ll see. Yolie helped me pick it out.\" \"Who\u0027s Yolie?\" Susannah asked.\\n\\n \"A girl who\u0027s in love with Jeremiah,\" I said, opening the box.\\n\\n Inside, nestled on a bed of cotton, was a small charm, a tiny silver key.\\n\\n Chapter thirty - seven\\n\\n AGE II\\n\\n \"Happy birthday, butthead,\" Steven sang, dumping a pail full of sand into my lap. A sand crab wriggled out of the sand and crawled onto my thigh. I let out a shriek and jumped up. I chased Steven down the beach, white hot fury pumping through my veins. I wasn\u0027t fast enough to catch him; I never was. He ran circles around me.\\n\\n \"Come and blow out your candles,\" my mother called.\\n\\n As soon as Steven turned around to head back to the towel, I leapt onto his back and with one arm around his neck, I pulled his hair as hard as I could.\\n\\n \"Ow!\" he howled, stumbling. I clung to his back like a monkey, even with Jeremiah grabbing my foot and trying to pull me off. Conrad fell to his knees, laughing.\\n\\n \"Children,\" Susannah called. \"There\u0027s cake!\" I hopped off of Steven\u0027s back and scrambled over to the blanket. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-37.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
