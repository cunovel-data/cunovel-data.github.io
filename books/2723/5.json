Then he stood up and pulled off his shirt. \"Pretty nice, huh?\"\\n\\n Susannah threw her head back and laughed, and my mother did too. \"Sit down, Jeremiah,\" she said, shaking the loaf of bread at him like a sword.\\n\\n \"What do you think, Belly?\" he asked me. He looked like he was winking even though he wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"Pretty nice,\" I agreed, trying not to smile.\\n\\n \"Now it\u0027s Belly\u0027s turn to show off,\" Conrad said mockingly.\\n\\n \"Belly doesn\u0027t need to show off. We can all see how lovely she is just looking at her,\" Susannah said, sipping her wine and smiling at me.\\n\\n \"Lovely? Yeah, right,\" said Steven. \"She\u0027s a lovely pain in my ass.\"\\n\\n \"Steven,\" my mother warned.\\n\\n \"What? What\u0027d I say?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Steven\u0027s too much of a pig to understand the concept of lovely,\" I said sweetly. I pushed the bread to him. \"Oink, oink, Steven. Have some more bread.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind if I do,\" he said, breaking off a crusty chunk.\\n\\n \"Belly, tell us about all the hot friends you\u0027re gonna set me up with,\" Jeremiah said.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t we already try that once?\" I said. \"Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve forgotten about Taylor Jewel already.\"\\n\\n Everyone busted up laughing then, even Conrad.\\n\\n Jeremiah\u0027s cheeks turned pink, but he was laughing too, and shaking his head. \"You\u0027re not a nice girl, Belly,\" he said. \"There\u0027s plenty of cute girls at the country club, so don\u0027t worry about me. Worry about Con. He\u0027s the one missing out.\"\\n\\n The original plan was for both Jeremiah and Conrad to work at the country club as lifeguards. Conrad had done it the summer before. This summer Jeremiah was old enough to do it with him, but Conrad changed his mind at the last minute and decided to bus tables at the fancy seafood buffet instead.\\n\\n We used to go there all the time. Kids twelve and younger could eat there for twenty dollars. There was a time when I was the only one twelve or younger. My mother always made sure to tell the waiter that I was younger than twelve. As, like, principle. Every time she did it, I felt like disappearing. I wished I was invisible. It wasn\u0027t that the boys even made a big deal out of it, which they easily could have, but it was the feeling different, like an outsider, that I hated. I hated it being pointed out. I just wanted to be like them.\\n\\n Chapter six\\n\\n AGE 10\\n\\n Right off the bat, the boys were a unit. Conrad was the leader. His word was pretty much law. Steven was his second in command, and Jeremiah was the jester. That first night, Conrad decided that the boys were going to sleep on the beach in sleeping bags and make a fire. He was a Boy Scout; he knew all about that kind of stuff.\\n\\n Jealously, I watched them plan. Especially when they packed the graham crackers and marshmallows. Don\u0027t take the whole box, I wanted to tell them. I didn\u0027t, though--it wasn\u0027t my place. It wasn\u0027t even my house.\\n\\n \"Steven, make sure you bring the flashlight,\" Conrad directed. Steven nodded quickly. I had never seen him follow orders before. He looked up to Conrad, who was eight months older; it had always been that way.\\n\\n Everybody had somebody but me. I wished I was at home, making butterscotch sundaes with my dad and eating them on our living room floor.\\n\\n \"Jeremiah, don\u0027t forget the cards,\" Conrad added, rolling up a sleeping bag.\\n\\n Jeremiah saluted him and danced a little jig, which made me giggle. \"Sir, yes, sir.\" He turned to me on the couch and said, \"Conrad is bossy like our dad. Don\u0027t feel like you have to listen to him or anything.\"\\n\\n Jeremiah talking to me made me feel brave enough to say, \"Can I come too?\"\\n\\n Right away Steven said, \"No. Guys only. Right, Con?\"\\n\\n Conrad hesitated. \"Sorry, Belly,\" he said, and he really did look sorry for a second. Two seconds, even. Then he went back to rolling his sleeping bag.\\n\\n I turned away from them and faced the TV. \"That\u0027s okay. I don\u0027t really care anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Ooh, watch out, Belly\u0027s gonna cry,\" Steven said joyously. To Jeremiah and Conrad he said, \"When she doesn\u0027t get her way, she cries. Our dad always falls for it.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Steven!\" I yelled. I was worried I really might cry. The last thing I needed was to be a crybaby our first night. Then they\u0027d never take me along for real.\\n\\n \"Belly\u0027s gonna cry,\" Steven said in a singsong voice. Then he and Jeremiah started to dance a jig together.\\n\\n \"Leave her alone,\" Conrad said.\\n\\n Steven stopped dancing. \"What?\" he said, confused.\\n\\n \"You guys are so immature,\" Conrad said, shaking his head.\\n\\n I watched them pick up their gear and get ready to leave. I was about to lose my chance to camp, to be a part of the gang. Quickly I said, \"Steven, if you don\u0027t let me go, I\u0027ll tell Mom.\"\\n\\n Steven\u0027s face twisted. \"No, you won\u0027t. Mom hates it when you tattletale.\"\\n\\n It was true, my mother hated it when I told on Steven for things like this. She\u0027d say he needed his own time, that I could go the next time around, that it would be more fun at the house with her and Beck anyway. I sank into the couch, arms crossed. I\u0027d lost my chance. Now I just looked like a tattletale, a baby.\\n\\n On the way out Jeremiah turned around and danced a quick jig for me, and I couldn\u0027t help it, I laughed. Over his shoulder Conrad said, \"Good night, Belly.\"\\n\\n And that was it. I was in love.\\n\\n Chapter seven\\n\\n I didn\u0027t notice right away that their family had more money than ours. The beach house wasn\u0027t some fancy kind of place. It was a real honest-to-God beach house, the kind that\u0027s lived in and comfortable. It had faded old seersucker couches and a creaking La-Z-Boy us kids always fought over, and peeling white paint and hardwood floors that had been bleached by the sun.\\n\\n But it was a big house, room enough for all of us and more. They\u0027d built an addition years ago. On one end there was my mother\u0027s room, Susannah and Mr. Fisher\u0027s room, and an empty guest room. On the other end was my room, another guest room, and the room the boys shared, which I was jealous of. There used to be bunk beds and a twin in that room, and I hated that I had to sleep all alone in mine when I could hear them giggling\\n\\n and whispering all night through the wall. A couple of times the boys let me sleep in there too, but only when they had some especially gruesome story they wanted to tell. I was a good audience. I always screamed at all the right places.\\n\\n Since we\u0027ve gotten older, the boys have stopped sharing a room. Steven started staying over on the parents\u0027 end, and Jeremiah and Conrad both had their rooms on my end. The boys and I have shared a bathroom since the beginning. Ours is on our end of the house, and then my mother has her own, and Susannah\u0027s is connected to the master bedroom. There are two sinks-- Jeremiah and Conrad shared one, and Steven and I shared the other. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-5.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
