He\u0027s gonna have lots of fun here, reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" Conrad ignored this, but Taylor giggled and tucked her hair behind her ears, which is when I knew that she liked Jeremiah now. Then Susannah said, \"Don\u0027t leave without some money for ice cream.\" I could tell she was happy we were all hanging out, except for Conrad, who seemed to prefer hanging out by himself this summer. Nothing made Susannah happier than thinking up activities for us kids to do. I think that she would have made a really good camp director. In the car we waited for my mother and the boys to come out, and I whispered, \"I thought you liked Conrad.\" Taylor rolled her eyes. \"Blah. He\u0027s boring. I think I\u0027ll like Jeremy instead.\" \"His name is Jeremiah,\" I said sourly. \"I know that.\" Then she looked at me, and her eyes widened. \"Why, do you like him now?\" \"No!\" She let out an impatient breath of air. \"Belly, you\u0027ve got to pick one. You can\u0027t have them both.\" \"I know that,\" I snapped. \"And for your information, I don\u0027t want either of them. It\u0027s not like they look at me like that anyway. They look at me like Steven does. Like a little sister.\" Taylor tugged at my T-shirt collar. \"Well, maybe if you showed a little cleave . . .\" I shrugged her hand away. \"I\u0027m not showing any \u0027cleave.\u0027 And I told you I don\u0027t like either of them. Not anymore.\" \"So you don\u0027t care that I\u0027m going after Jeremy?\" she asked. I could tell the only reason she was asking was so she could absolve herself of any future guilt. Not that she would even feel guilty. So I said, \"If I told you I cared, would you stop?\" She thought for, like, a second. \"Probably. If you really, really cared. But then I would just go after Conrad. I\u0027m here to have fun, Belly.\" I sighed. At least she was honest. I wanted to say, I thought you were here to have fun with me. But I didn\u0027t. \"Go after him,\" I told her. \"I don\u0027t care.\" Taylor wiggled her eyebrows at me, her old trademark move. \"Yay! It is so on.\" \"Wait.\" I grabbed her wrist. \"Promise me you\u0027ll be nice to him.\" \"Of course I\u0027ll be nice. I\u0027m always nice.\" She patted me on the shoulder. \"You\u0027re such a worrier, Belly. I told you, I just want to have fun.\" That\u0027s when my mother and the boys came out, and for the first time there was no fight over shotgun. Jeremiah gave it over to Steven easily. When we got to the boardwalk, Steven headed straight for the arcade and spent the whole night there. Jeremiah walked around with us, and he even rode the carousel, even though I knew he thought it was lame. He got all stretched out on the sleigh and pretended to take a nap while Taylor and I bounced up and down on horses, mine a blond palomino and hers a black stallion . (Black Beauty was still her favorite book, although she\u0027d never admit it.) Then Taylor made him win her a stuffed Tweety Bird with the quarter toss. Jeremiah was a pro at the quarter toss. The Tweety Bird was huge, almost as tall as she was. He carried it for her. I should never have gone along. I could have predicted the whole night, right down to how invisible I\u0027d feel. All the time I wished I was at home, listening to Conrad play the guitar through my bedroom wall, or watching Woody Allen movies with Susannah and my mother. And I didn\u0027t even like Woody Allen. I wondered if this was how the rest of the week was going to be. I\u0027d forgotten that about Taylor, the way she got when she wanted something--driven, single-minded, and determined as all get-out. She\u0027d just arrived, and already she\u0027d forgotten about me. Chapter nineteen We\u0027d only just gotten there, and it was already time for Steven to go. He and our dad were going on their college road trip, and instead of coming back to Cousins after, he was going home. Supposedly to start studying for the SATs, but more likely, to hang out with his new girlfriend. I went to his room to watch him pack up. He hadn\u0027t brought much, just a duffel bag. I was suddenly sad to see him leave. Without Steven everything would be off balance--he was the buffer, the real life reminder that nothing really changes, that everything can stay the same. Because, Steven never changed. He was just obnoxious, insufferable Steven, my big brother, the bane of my existence. He was like our old flannel blanket that smelled like wet dog--smelly, comforting, a part of the infrastructure that made up my world. And with him there, everything would still be the same, three against one, boys against girls. \"I wish you weren\u0027t leaving,\" I said, tucking my knees into my chest. \"I\u0027ll see you in a month,\" he reminded me. \"A month and a half,\" I corrected him sullenly. \"You\u0027re missing my birthday, you know.\" \"I\u0027ll give you your present when I see you at home.\" \"Not the same.\" I knew I was being a baby, but I couldn\u0027t help it. \"Will you at least send me a postcard?\" Steven zipped up his duffel bag. \"I doubt I\u0027ll have time. I\u0027ll send you a text, though.\" \"Will you bring me back a Princeton sweatshirt?\" I couldn\u0027t wait to wear a college sweatshirt. They were like a badge that said you were mature, practically college age if not already. I wished I had a whole drawer full of them. \"If I remember,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll remind you,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll text you.\" \"Okay. It\u0027ll be your birthday present.\" \"Deal.\" I fell back onto his bed and pushed my feet up against his wall. He hated it when I did that. \"I\u0027ll probably miss you, a little bit.\" \"You\u0027ll be too busy drooling over Conrad to notice I\u0027m gone,\" Steven said. I stuck my tongue out at him. Steven left really early the next morning. Conrad and Jeremiah were going to drive him to the airport. I went down to say good-bye, but I didn\u0027t try to go along because I knew he wouldn\u0027t want me to. He wanted some time, just them, and for once I was going to let him have it without a fight. When he hugged me good-bye, he gave me his trademark condescending look--sad eyes and a half grimace-- and said, \"Don\u0027t do anything stupid, all right?\" He said it in this really meaningful way, like he was trying to tell me something important, like I was supposed to understand. But I didn\u0027t. I said, \"Don\u0027t you do anything stupid either, butthead.\" He sighed and shook his head at me like I was a child. I tried not to let it bother me. After all, he was leaving, and things wouldn\u0027t be the same without him. At the very least I could send him off without getting into a petty argument. \"Tell Dad I said hi,\" I said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-summer-1/page-16.html","bookId":2723,"book":{"id":2723,"title":"The Summer I Turned Pretty (Summer #1)","description":"Storyline: Belly measures her life in summers.
