You’re crazy about him and I have to tell you I think it’s great. I don’t want Dad stepping in now and ruining it for you.”\\n\\n “But I don’t know what I want,” she said, sitting down and reaching for her napkin. Although she made a pretense of eating, she hardly swallowed a single bite.\\n\\n “Yes, you do,” Andrew countered softly. “You do know.”\\n\\n “Your father and I have talked about this and maybe he’s right… I’d gotten so wrapped up in you kids and all the volunteer work I did with—”\\n\\n “Mom,” Andrew said, cutting her off. “You’re a good mother. You always were.”\\n\\n “But was I a good wife?”\\n\\n “Yes,” he said emphatically, “and don’t let anyone convince you otherwise. You did everything for Dad. You staged homes and ran errands and organized parties.”\\n\\n “Well, yes, I helped where I could.”\\n\\n “Trust me, you were a good wife.”\\n\\n “I played a role in the divorce, too, Andrew. I didn’t see it right away but I wasn’t completely innocent. I allowed our marriage to grow stale. Your father was manipulated by a woman out to advance her career and the shortest path came through using Grant.\\n\\n Yes, he let her do it, but he paid a high price for that. I wish you’d stop being so hard on him.”\\n\\n Andrew stared at her as if seeing her with new eyes. “I can’t believe you’re defending him.”\\n\\n “Think about it, Andrew. Your father’s alone. Really alone.\\n\\n Oh, he talks to Annie but until recently the two of us hardly ever spoke. You don’t have much contact with him, either. He isn’t fond of his sister and—”\\n\\n “And he doesn’t visit his mother nearly as often as he should.”\\n\\n “Okay, I agree. Not only that, I believe your grandmother might be moving to Florida.”\\n\\n “Yeah, I got that feeling when I talked to her. She’s head over heels for this old boyfriend of hers, isn’t she?”\\n\\n “Yes.” Bethanne smiled. “But getting back to your father…”\\n\\n “Okay, Mom, I see what you mean. Dad’s out in the cold, but frankly he put himself there. It isn’t like we shoved him out the door and then turned the lock. He chose to leave.”\\n\\n “It takes a big man to admit when he’s been wrong,” she said, consciously quoting Ruth. “Your father would give anything to undo the harm he did. I admire him for that. Look at it from his point of view.”\\n\\n Andrew slowly shook his head. “I wish I could. You and Annie might be willing to forgive and forget, but I can’t. Dad was heart less and calculating. He couldn’t dump us fast enough when he left. I tried to talk to him, tried to get him to see reason. I begged him to reconsider, and you know what?” Her son’s voice rose with emotion. “He hung up on me. And you know what else? He doesn’t even remember doing it. My coming to him meant nothing. Nothing. Well, he can come to me now and I’ll give him the same treatment and we’ll see how much he likes being ignored.”\\n\\n “Oh, Andrew…” Bethanne had no idea her son had ever tried to reason with Grant.\\n\\n His jaw was clenched as she reached across the table and laid her hand over his wrist. “I wish I knew what to say.”\\n\\n He grew even more intense. “Don’t ask me to forgive him, Mom, because I don’t think I can.”\\n\\n Thirty-Four\\n\\n “Where’s Dad?” Annie asked anxiously, turning to Bethanne as if she could supply the answer. Annie and the other bridesmaids were lined up at the back of the church. Everyone was there for the wedding rehearsal—everyone except Grant. Courtney carried a paper-plate bouquet comprising the ribbons from her two wedding showers; her grandmother, Vera Pulanski, had created it. Her father, along with her brother, his wife and their two children, were seated in a pew. Her sister, Juliana, was her matron of honor, so she, too, waited with Annie.\\n\\n “Dad should be here,” Annie said. “Grandma and Royce were asking where he is.”\\n\\n “I’m sure he’s on his way,” Bethanne whispered reassuringly. The rehearsal was about to start and he hadn’t shown up yet. This wasn’t like Grant, who was rarely late for anything. The last time they’d spoken he’d said he’d be at the church by five, but it was quarter past now. She glanced at her watch again, fighting down her concern.\\n\\n “Ms. Hamlin,” Pastor Hudson said, smiling over at Bethanne. “I need you to sit here.”\\n\\n “Okay.” She moved to the spot he indicated.\\n\\n “Your husband isn’t here?” he asked.\\n\\n “Apparently, my ex-husband has been delayed,” Bethanne said, and looked at her watch again.\\n\\n “Your ex-husband,” Pastor Hudson repeated. “In that case we should make other arrangements.”\\n\\n Bethanne was about to mention that Grant wanted the two of them to sit in the same pew. She couldn’t decide whether she should. Grant would be disappointed if they took separate pews, but she was afraid their family and friends would read too much into their sitting together.\\n\\n In the end, she didn’t say anything to the pastor; she’d explain it to Grant later.\\n\\n The rehearsal was almost over before he arrived—breathless and contrite. “I got held up in traffic. There was an accident and everything came to a standstill,” he said as he rushed through the church doors. “I tried to phone but everyone’s cell is turned off.”\\n\\n “It’s all right, Dad,” Annie assured him.\\n\\n “I’m sorry,” he said again, and looked at Andrew, who ignored him. “I would’ve been here if it was humanly possible.”\\n\\n “We understand, Grant,” Bethanne murmured.\\n\\n He seemed to appreciate that, but it was several minutes before he calmed down. Pastor Hudson reviewed the procedures a second time. When he pointed out that Grant wouldn’t be sitting with Bethanne, Grant’s eyes shot to hers.\\n\\n His look of chagrin nearly undid her, but she was impressed by his quick recovery. He nodded and silently took his place. Bethanne felt bad about it, but she’d never agreed that they’d sit together as a married couple.\\n\\n “What happened?” Ruth asked when the rehearsal was over. “Everyone was worried.”\\n\\n “Traffic,” Bethanne explained, coming to stand beside Grant.\\n\\n “It’s my own fault,” he said. “I left the office later than I intended.”\\n\\n Royce joined them, slipping his arm around Ruth. The couple were charming together—a reminder to everyone that love is ageless.\\n\\n “We’re heading out for the rehearsal dinner,” Annie said, approaching the group. “Grandma and Royce, do you want to ride with me?”\\n\\n “Sure.”\\n\\n “I’ll take them,” Grant offered. “I need to spend as much time with my mother as I can.”\\n\\n “Why, Grandma?” Annie asked. “Are you going somewhere?” She exchanged a smile with Bethanne.\\n\\n “Florida,” Royce answered. “And the sooner, the better.”\\n\\n “Royce,” Ruth protested, but not too much. “We weren’t going to say anything until after Andrew’s wedding.”\\n\\n “Are you and Royce engaged?” Bethanne asked.\\n\\n Royce raised Ruth’s hand to his lips while she blushed. “We are,” he said. “No ring yet, but I didn’t want even one more day to go by without making it official.”\\n\\n “Congratulations, Mom,” Grant said, hugging her, then shaking hands with Royce. “So you’re moving to Florida.”\\n\\n “I am,” she said as she looked up at Royce. “You won’t miss me.”\\n\\n “Don’t be so sure about that, but I can see you’re in good hands.”\\n\\n “You’re welcome to visit as often as you like,” Royce told him.\\n\\n “Within reason,” Ruth added. “We’re going to be newlyweds and we might not be interested in company for some time.”\\n\\n Grant laughed. “You’ll definitely see me in Vero,” he said. His eyes met Bethanne’s and he smiled.\\n\\n Bethanne kissed the older woman’s cheek. “I couldn’t be happier for you, Ruth.”\\n\\n “Thank you, sweetie.”\\n\\n The church had started to empty; the wedding party, plus assorted family members, were on their way to the Blue Moon, where the rehearsal dinner was being held.\\n\\n Grant led his mother and Royce outside. “Don’t worry,” he joked, “I won’t be late for dinner.” He pulled out his keys and pushed the remote to unlock the car door.\\n\\n Bethanne waved and walked toward her own car.\\n\\n The Blue Moon was a restaurant Bethanne had often worked with through the years. She had a good relationship with the manager, who’d been accommodating and helpful.\\n\\n When she got there, Grant caught up with her just as she was about to enter the banquet room. “Before we go in, I have a question.”\\n\\n “Yes?” Bethanne said, although she would’ve preferred to put off a conversation with him until after dinner. She had a number of last-minute things she needed to check.\\n\\n “Did Andrew decide to serve the wine…Max sent?”\\n\\n “Yes.” No point in prevaricating or dodging the truth.\\n\\n Grant stiffened at her answer.\\n\\n “It was up to Andrew and Courtney.”\\n\\n “If someone asks about the wine, what will you tell them?”\\n\\n “I’ll say it came from a family friend—but why would anyone ask?”\\n\\n Grant held her look for a long moment before he lowered his eyes. “You’re right,” he mumbled. “No one will.”\\n\\n Bethanne reached for his hand and gently squeezed it. “Tonight and tomorrow aren’t about us. This time is for our son and Courtney. Agreed?”\\n\\n Grant nodded. “I shouldn’t have said anything. I can’t seem to keep my foot out of my mouth, can I?”\\n\\n Bethanne patted him on the shoulder. “Grant, it’s fine.” His evening had begun badly with that traffic accident and then arriving late for the rehearsal. She could see how tense he was throughout dinner, not really connecting with anyone, which was uncharacteristic for him. He stayed close to his mother and Royce and made eye contact with Bethanne several times, but she was busy organizing the dinner and greeting family and friends.\\n\\n By the time she was ready to leave, he’d disappeared.\\n\\n The wedding was taking place on Saturday afternoon at three. Bethanne helped Courtney dress, as did Courtney’s sister, Juliana, her matron of honor. In her beautiful slim-fitting gown, with the wedding purse their friend Anne Marie Roche had knit and wearing Bethanne’s gloves, she looked elegant. Lovely. Her beauty came from more than simply her appearance; so much love and happiness shone from her face that Bethanne was nearly brought to tears. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-49.html","bookId":1940,"book":{"id":1940,"title":"A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8)","description":"Storyline: A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8) \\n Six years after he had walked out on his wife and kids, Grant was freshly single again and looking to reconcile with Bethanne Hamlin. To forgive the betrayal was one thing, she did that for herself. To forget was something that she didn’t think she could ever do and she wasn’t sure if she could ever trust him again either. Being willing to at least think about it for the sake of the grown kids, herself, him, she wasn’t sure, but think about it she was. Hearing that her ex-mother-in-law was planning a road trip across the country to her 50th class reunion in Florida was the perfect excuse to get away and do that thinking. With the addition of her daughter Annie, Ruth and Bethanne set out to see America. Even though Ruth had made plans, the addition of Annie added spontaneity to the group, taking them off the plotted course early in the trip. Helping out in a diner for an old friend of Ruth’s was the fist of may changes to come. Then they have trouble with the rental car with only one source of help, and that coming from a group of motorcycle riders they met at the diner. Offering a ride to the nearest town was the best way for Max to help, but the connection they found while offering confessions may make some decisions more difficult.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
