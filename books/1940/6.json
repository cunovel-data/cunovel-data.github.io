The mirror also reflected the queen-size bed her parents had once shared. Even after six years of living alone, her mother still slept on the right-hand side. Not in the middle.\\n\\n Silly as it sounded, this gave Annie hope that her parents would one day reunite. It was what her father wanted most in the world. What Annie wanted, too. Her parents were meant to be together. Her father had made a terrible mistake, but he was sorry. More than anything he wanted to make it up to the family, and in Annie’s opinion they should let him.\\n\\n It felt good to be close to her dad again. Now that the lovely Tiffany was gone, Annie felt there was real hope for a reconciliation between her parents. It just seemed wrong for them to live apart. The problem was getting her mother to recognize how sincere he was and take him back. Annie loved them both so much, and all she wanted was for them to be happy. What they did with their lives wasn’t really up to her, as Andrew pointed out with annoying regularity, but sometimes she felt she understood them better than they understood themselves.\\n\\n The security alarm beeped, indicating that someone had entered the house. “Is that you, Mom?” Annie called down from the second-story hallway.\\n\\n “Annie? What are you doing here?”\\n\\n Annie had her own apartment near the University of Washington campus. “I came to borrow your silver belt. You don’t mind, do you?”\\n\\n “Of course not.”\\n\\n “Are you and Dad finished with dinner already?” she asked as she walked down the stairs.\\n\\n “Yes, it didn’t take long.” Bethanne hung her jacket in the hall closet and smiled over at Annie. “You look fabulous.”\\n\\n “You think so?” Confirmation from her mother meant everything.\\n\\n “What time is Vance picking you up for dinner?” her mother asked, glancing at her watch.\\n\\n “Eight-thirty. Our reservation isn’t until nine.”\\n\\n “That’s a little late for dinner, isn’t it?”\\n\\n Annie nodded. “Vance said that was the earliest he could get us a table. Every tourist visiting Seattle wants to eat at the Space Needle. Vance must have pulled a few strings to even get a reservation.”\\n\\n Her mother considered the comment. “I didn’t realize Vance knew anyone with strings to pull.”\\n\\n “Mom,” she protested. “Vance had classes with Matt, remember? And Matt buses tables at the Space Needle. Matt must’ve put in a word for Vance.”\\n\\n “He must have.” Her mother walked into the living room, where she kept her knitting.\\n\\n “How’re Courtney’s wedding gloves coming along?”\\n\\n “So far so good.” Bethanne settled into her favorite chair. She had the pattern on a clipboard, held there by a magnet that marked her row. Her mother picked up her glasses, perching them on the end of her nose, and her knitting, which only had a few rows completed.\\n\\n This was a far more complicated project than anything Annie would ever undertake. “I want you to knit something for my wedding, too, you know.”\\n\\n “I wouldn’t dream of doing anything else—when the time comes. If you want, you can take a look at the dress and veil I wore when I married your father. It’s yours should you choose to wear it.”\\n\\n “Oh. Mom, could I really wear your wedding dress?”\\n\\n “We’re about the same size, so I don’t see why not.”\\n\\n Her parents’ wedding picture used to hang on the stairway wall. Annie had seen it practically every day of her life until after their divorce. She didn’t know where the photograph was anymore. The last time she’d noticed it, the glass had been cracked. She assumed her mother had broken it the morning her father announced he was in love with the lovely Tiffany.\\n\\n Annie couldn’t quite remember what the wedding dress looked like. What she did recall was the joy on her mother’s face. She’d been such a young woman—younger than Annie—and a beautiful bride. Her father had been young, too, and so handsome. Annie had loved that photograph.\\n\\n “It would make me happy if you decided to wear my wedding dress when you do get married.” Then, as if her mother wanted to change the subject, she said, “Oh, and thank you.”\\n\\n “For what?”\\n\\n “For not mentioning to your father that Grandma Hamlin and I are taking this road trip.”\\n\\n Annie felt uneasy about the whole plan. The thought of her mother and grandmother traveling unescorted across the entire country, from Washington to Florida, sent chills down her spine. “I still don’t think this is a good idea.”\\n\\n “Nonsense.” Her mother leaned forward and, using a yellow pen, marked off the row she’d just finished.\\n\\n “You told Dad, didn’t you?” Annie asked. She hadn’t said anything about it because she was sure her mother would.\\n\\n “Actually, no.”\\n\\n “Mom!” Annie couldn’t believe her mother would keep this a secret. “Dad has a right to know what you’re doing.”\\n\\n Bethanne glanced up from her knitting. “And why is that?”\\n\\n “Because…because he might object.”\\n\\n “Annie, sweetheart, I stopped listening to your father’s objections a long time ago.”\\n\\n “But you’re going with Grandma!”\\n\\n “Then she can tell him.”\\n\\n What her mother said made sense, but Annie had the feeling her grandmother wasn’t going to let Grant or Aunt Robin know what she intended, either.\\n\\n “If you aren’t going to say anything, then someone needs to let him know.”\\n\\n Her mother heaved an exasperated sigh. “Do what you want, but as far as I’m concerned it isn’t any of his business.”\\n\\n “Honestly, Mom, how can you say that?” Annie grabbed her sweater. “I’ve got to go. Wish me luck.” She held up her left hand and wiggled her ring finger, then rushed out the door.\\n\\n Vance picked her up right on time and looked great in his slacks and plaid shirt with a button-down collar. He didn’t have a tie—he hated them—but that was fine. He’d wear a tuxedo for the wedding.\\n\\n Annie had narrowed her bridesmaid choices down to five. She’d ask Courtney, her sister-in-law-to-be, and Libby, Belle, Jazmine and Maddy. Ideally, she’d like six or seven bridesmaids, but that would require the same number of groomsmen and make for an impossibly large wedding party. In any case, with everything she knew about organizing social gatherings, their wedding would be the event of the year.\\n\\n Vance seemed unusually quiet as they drove to the Space Needle. He didn’t use valet parking, so they walked the short distance from the closest lot.\\n\\n “Oh, Vance, this is a lovely idea,” she said, clutching his hand. He could be such a romantic.\\n\\n He responded with a weak smile.\\n\\n His hand was sweaty, and Annie realized Vance was nervous. She longed to hold on to every detail of this special night and keep them close to her heart. One day she’d tell their children about the evening their father proposed. These were the moments of which family stories were made.\\n\\n After the elevator ride to the top of the Space Needle, they were seated at a table overlooking the city. The restaurant did a slow rotation, so that during the course of the meal, they’d be treated to a full view of Puget Sound, the Cascades to the east and the Olympics to the west, along with the Seattle city lights.\\n\\n Staring at her menu, Annie was convinced she wouldn’t be able to eat a single bite until Vance got up the courage to propose. From the way he kept looking uneasily around and drinking from his water glass, she figured he might need some help.\\n\\n “Tonight’s special, isn’t it, Vance?” she said as she set aside her menu.\\n\\n “Very.” He smiled, but his eyes refused to meet hers.\\n\\n “Are you…nervous about something?” This part would make a great addition to the story when she repeated it to their children. “A little.”\\n\\n “Vance, there’s no need. We know each other so well, there isn’t anything we can’t say.”\\n\\n He glanced at her as if to gauge the truth of her words. “You’re sure about that?”\\n\\n “Positively sure.” She offered him one of her brightest, most encouraging smiles.\\n\\n “Maybe we should have dinner first.”\\n\\n “Will you enjoy the meal if you put this off?” she asked gently.\\n\\n He shook his head and his shoulders sagged. “Probably not.”\\n\\n “Then why don’t we discuss what’s on your mind?” Maybe it would help if she told him she knew what he intended, but she decided not to ruin his moment. “I believe I know why you’re trying to make this night so special,” she said instead, hoping she didn’t sound coy. “Please, Vance, don’t be intimidated. Just ask me.”\\n\\n “Okay, if you’re sure.” He braced his forearms on the edge of the table. “First, you know you’re the one for me, right?”\\n\\n Annie’s heart beat just a little faster. “And you’re the man for me.” She stretched her arm across the table and Vance took her hand. His thumb stroked her wrist.\\n\\n Thankfully, the waiter seemed to recognize that now was not the time to take their drink order. He started toward their table, then did a quick about-face.\\n\\n “That’s why this decision has been so difficult,” Vance continued.\\n\\n “Difficult?” Annie didn’t understand why giving her an engagement ring would be the slightest bit difficult.\\n\\n “I’ve decided to go to Europe for a year.” The words came out in a rush as if he were gasping for air.\\n\\n “Europe? A year?” she repeated in confusion.\\n\\n “With Matt,” Vance elaborated.\\n\\n “Matt? The same Matt who got you the reservation for tonight? That Matt?”\\n\\n Vance nodded. “We’ve been talking about it for months,” he said excitedly, “and we both felt that if we were ever going to do it, this is the time. I’ve got my graduation money and Matt’s been saving up what’s left over from his paycheck. We plan on staying in hostels and traveling from country to country by train. There’s even a chance we might be able to work on a dig near Ephesus. That’s in Turkey.”\\n\\n “I know where Ephesus is,” she said through gritted teeth.\\n\\n “Right…sorry. You’re not upset, are you?”\\n\\n This was a joke. It had to be. Only, she wasn’t laughing and Vance seemed about to bolt.\\n\\n “I wanted to make sure you know I love you,” Vance went on. “And…and I didn’t want you to hear from anyone else that Jessie Olivarez is going with us. She’s Matt’s girlfriend and an archaeology major, too, but I didn’t want there to be any misunderstanding. Like, I don’t want you to think I’m dating Jessie because I’m not. I’m in love with you.”\\n\\n “Jessie?” Vance and Matt were taking a girl with them. “Jessie Olivarez is traveling with you?” They’d met twice, and Annie found her clingy and immature.\\n\\n “I knew you couldn’t take that much time out of your life,” Vance said. “You’ve got your brother’s wedding and another year of school. Besides, you’re working with your mom, and that would make it hard to leave for so long.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-6.html","bookId":1940,"book":{"id":1940,"title":"A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8)","description":"Storyline: A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8) \\n Six years after he had walked out on his wife and kids, Grant was freshly single again and looking to reconcile with Bethanne Hamlin. To forgive the betrayal was one thing, she did that for herself. To forget was something that she didn’t think she could ever do and she wasn’t sure if she could ever trust him again either. Being willing to at least think about it for the sake of the grown kids, herself, him, she wasn’t sure, but think about it she was. Hearing that her ex-mother-in-law was planning a road trip across the country to her 50th class reunion in Florida was the perfect excuse to get away and do that thinking. With the addition of her daughter Annie, Ruth and Bethanne set out to see America. Even though Ruth had made plans, the addition of Annie added spontaneity to the group, taking them off the plotted course early in the trip. Helping out in a diner for an old friend of Ruth’s was the fist of may changes to come. Then they have trouble with the rental car with only one source of help, and that coming from a group of motorcycle riders they met at the diner. Offering a ride to the nearest town was the best way for Max to help, but the connection they found while offering confessions may make some decisions more difficult.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
