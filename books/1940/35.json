She owned a couple of them, which she treasured, but didn’t intend to collect more.\\n\\n “May I help you?” a pleasant clerk inquired.\\n\\n “Just looking, thanks,” Bethanne said as she continued down the aisle. Both Annie and Ruth had followed her inside. They each found a different area to explore. The wooden floors creaked with age as Bethanne examined the contents of a display case.\\n\\n “We recently got in something quite unusual, if you’re interested in a memento that’s out of the ordinary,” the clerk said. She moved behind a glass counter and brought out a small box.\\n\\n Inside was a plain fabric button. Bethanne couldn’t see anything special about this particular button, other than its obvious age.\\n\\n “This was sewn in the collar of a Confederate uniform,” the woman said as she reverently took the button from its protective box and held it in the palm of her hand. “I have a photograph of it here.” The clerk laid a picture of a tattered gray uniform beside the now-empty box. “When young men left for the War Between the States, their sweethearts would often soak a button in perfume. Once it was dry they’d sew it into their loved one’s uniform collar, reminding the soldier of all he’d left behind. That way, whenever he was lonely for his home and his sweetheart, all he had to do was breathe deeply.”\\n\\n “That’s so romantic,” Annie said, coming to stand next to her mother.\\n\\n “How much is it?” Bethanne asked.\\n\\n The clerk named a price that shocked her. “For a button? Thank you, but no. That’s way out of my price range.”\\n\\n “Mom, you should get it,” Annie urged.\\n\\n Bethanne shook her head. “What would I do with it?”\\n\\n “Keep it as a souvenir of our trip,” Annie said. “It’s different and historical and so romantic.”\\n\\n Bethanne considered it for a moment. “I think I’d rather buy something else.”\\n\\n “Something more reasonably priced, you mean,” Ruth commented, having joined them, as well.\\n\\n The three shopped a bit longer. Annie bought a number of small items for her girlfriends and Ruth purchased pralines to bring to her own friends at home. In the end, Bethanne didn’t get anything; she wasn’t in much of a buying mood. She missed Max.\\n\\n As soon as they returned to their hotel room, Ruth changed into her pajamas and was asleep almost immediately.\\n\\n Annie was busy on her iPhone, answering emails. Taking the opportunity to soak in the tub, Bethanne sought a quiet thirty minutes to herself. A bubble bath was a luxury she hadn’t enjoyed in a while. As she lay in the hot bubbly water, she closed her eyes.\\n\\n She was completely relaxed when Annie stepped into the bathroom and sat on the edge of the tub.\\n\\n “Do you need anything, sweetie?” Bethanne asked.\\n\\n Annie didn’t say anything right away. “I’m glad Max isn’t here,” she mumbled.\\n\\n “I know.” Bethanne tried not to sound defensive.\\n\\n “I can see how much you like him.”\\n\\n “I do.” Bethanne understood her daughter’s concerns. “You’re afraid Max might ruin any chance of a reconciliation between your father and me. Look, Annie, I know how much you want me to get back with your father. But what you need to remember is that nothing’s the same as it was six years ago. Our family will never return to the way it used to be. You and Andrew are adults now. I’d never attempt to convince either of you to enter a relationship you didn’t feel was right. I expect the same courtesy and respect.”\\n\\n Her daughter blinked and then nodded.\\n\\n “We understand each other?”\\n\\n Annie nodded again. “Just promise me one thing.”\\n\\n “What is it?”\\n\\n “Give Dad a chance. Just give my dad a chance.”\\n\\n Twenty-Three\\n\\n “Mom,” Annie whispered. She hadn’t slept. The glowing digital alarm by her side told her it was a little after three. There was a strip of light under the door from the hallway, but except for that and the clock, the room was dark. Grandma Hamlin snored softly in the other bed.\\n\\n “Hmm?” her mother returned groggily.\\n\\n “Are you awake?”\\n\\n “I am now,” Bethanne said, and rolled onto her back.\\n\\n Annie stared at the ceiling. “Are you mad at me?”\\n\\n Her mother sat up, leaning against the pillows, and studied Annie. “Why would I be mad at you?”\\n\\n “Because of what I said about Max,” she whispered. “The thing is, I think I might really like him if it wasn’t for Dad.” Annie had lain awake, examining her feelings, and realized that Max and Rooster were good guys, kind and helpful. She had no idea what would’ve happened at the lake if they hadn’t come by when they did.\\n\\n “You really care about him, don’t you?” Annie sighed. Her father could have put an end to this romance and he hadn’t. More than that, he’d actually insisted they leave Bethanne alone to make her own decision. Annie admired his attitude, which she viewed as brave and selfless, but she wanted to shout at him to do something and fast. He wouldn’t listen, though. Both her parents were such complicated people.\\n\\n “I do care about Max.” Her mother’s voice was tender.\\n\\n “It’s kind of weird watching my mother fall in love with someone other than my father.”\\n\\n “I can’t say I’m in love with him, Annie. It’s too soon for that. I’m…infatuated with Max, but we haven’t faced any real difficulties yet. I think it would be easy to fall in love with him one day. I like Max a lot, and I hope things work out so we can be together, but they might not.”\\n\\n “But you love Dad, too, right?” She felt as if the dream she held of seeing her parents reconcile was crumbling at her feet.\\n\\n “I do care a great deal for your father. I can’t dismiss our years together because of an error in judgment he made.” Her mother lay down again. “However, I doubt that you woke me up to chat about your father and me. What’s up, sweetie?”\\n\\n Annie sighed, unsure where to start. “I heard from Vance again.” She made it sound like he’d only emailed her a couple of times. The fact was, Vance had contacted her nearly every day since he’d left for Europe with Matt and Jessie. She hadn’t answered most of his emails.\\n\\n “You mentioned that he’s homesick and wants to come back to Seattle.”\\n\\n “He can’t. His ticket home isn’t good until next year. When he tried to change it, the airlines wanted to charge him for a whole new ticket. He doesn’t have that kind of money and he can’t ask his parents. He says the airline’s being unreasonable and I agree with him.”\\n\\n “He must have known that when he booked his flights.”\\n\\n “But he already paid for his return ticket!”\\n\\n “He’s had a pretty quick change of heart, hasn’t he?” Bethanne commented. “He’s only been in Europe a couple of weeks.”\\n\\n “Yes…”\\n\\n “What aren’t you telling me, Annie?”\\n\\n That was the problem with her mother, Annie thought. She read between the lines far too easily.\\n\\n “Okay.” She closed her eyes tightly. “Vance wants me to meet him in France at the end of the month.” There, she’d said it, and held her breath while she waited for her mother’s reaction. “What do you think about that?”\\n\\n Annie should’ve known. Her mother always did this. She turned everything into a question. “I’m not sure,” she admitted. “That’s why I wanted to talk to you. I need advice.”\\n\\n “All right,” her mother said. “Obviously, this is bothering you. Otherwise, you’d be fast asleep.”\\n\\n “And so would you,” Annie added, smiling.\\n\\n “True.”\\n\\n Her mother didn’t sound upset, though, and that was reassuring.\\n\\n “First, how do you feel about Vance?”\\n\\n “Now or before we left?”\\n\\n “Now.”\\n\\n “Well…I miss him. Before he decided to go to Europe, we talked practically every day. We were almost always together, which is one reason I was so upset when I found out he was going to Europe with Matt and Jessie.”\\n\\n “He kept it a secret.”\\n\\n “He wanted to tell me, or so he said, but Matt told him not to.”\\n\\n “And he listened to his friend instead of doing what he knew was right.”\\n\\n “Yeah.”\\n\\n “Did he say why he wants you to meet him in France?”\\n\\n Annie folded her hands behind her head and stared up at the ceiling some more. “He said he’s tired of being a third wheel. Matt and Jessie are having all these arguments and he’s afraid he doesn’t have enough money to last a year and—”\\n\\n “In other words, nothing is turning out the way he thought it would,” her mother finished for her. “And that’s why he invited you to fly over and join him?”\\n\\n Just the way her mother asked told Annie she thought it was a pretty selfish reason. “That’s what he said, but you have to remember Vance isn’t exactly a great communicator.”\\n\\n Annie wanted to believe he was lost and lonely without her and that he regretted everything. He hadn’t said so, but she knew that was what he really meant. Or what she hoped he meant…\\n\\n “Well, you’ll have to decide if he’s sincere,” her mother whispered. “If he’s asking because he wants to be with you or he just doesn’t want to be alone.”\\n\\n Annie lowered her voice, too, not wanting to wake her grandmother. “He does want to be with me!”\\n\\n “That’s not what he said, though, is it?”\\n\\n “Well, no, but it’s what he meant.”\\n\\n Her mother was silent for several minutes. “It sounds to me like you want to be with Vance, too.”\\n\\n That was true, although Annie hated admitting it. “He really hurt me, Mom.”\\n\\n “I know, honey.”\\n\\n “I think he needs to work harder for me to put this behind us, don’t you?”\\n\\n “Are you saying you don’t think he’s suffered enough?”\\n\\n Annie snickered in the dark. “You’re funny, Mom.”\\n\\n “You do want him to suffer, though, right?”\\n\\n “Well, he should. He went behind my back and planned this whole trip without telling me anything. I’m supposed to be his girlfriend—wouldn’t you assume he’d want me to know? I shared everything with him. I thought I wanted to marry him and I believed he felt the same about me.”\\n\\n “I know.”\\n\\n “Not only does he hit me with the news that he’s going to Europe with his two friends, but then he insults my intelligence by asking me to drive him to the airport.”\\n\\n “That does take gall,” her mother agreed.\\n\\n “Wouldn’t you want him to suffer?”\\n\\n “I’m afraid I would.”\\n\\n Annie knew she could count on her mother to be on her side.\\n\\n “But when is it enough? It’s hard to know when I should forgive and forget.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-35.html","bookId":1940,"book":{"id":1940,"title":"A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8)","description":"Storyline: A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8) \\n Six years after he had walked out on his wife and kids, Grant was freshly single again and looking to reconcile with Bethanne Hamlin. To forgive the betrayal was one thing, she did that for herself. To forget was something that she didn’t think she could ever do and she wasn’t sure if she could ever trust him again either. Being willing to at least think about it for the sake of the grown kids, herself, him, she wasn’t sure, but think about it she was. Hearing that her ex-mother-in-law was planning a road trip across the country to her 50th class reunion in Florida was the perfect excuse to get away and do that thinking. With the addition of her daughter Annie, Ruth and Bethanne set out to see America. Even though Ruth had made plans, the addition of Annie added spontaneity to the group, taking them off the plotted course early in the trip. Helping out in a diner for an old friend of Ruth’s was the fist of may changes to come. Then they have trouble with the rental car with only one source of help, and that coming from a group of motorcycle riders they met at the diner. Offering a ride to the nearest town was the best way for Max to help, but the connection they found while offering confessions may make some decisions more difficult.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
