She stepped up to their table, pad and pen in hand. “I’d like French toast,” Annie said, and gave the woman her menu. “One poached egg on dry wheat,” Ruth said. “Max.” Bethanne closed the menu and held it out to the waitress—and found three women staring at her. “What?” she asked, not understanding why her scrambled eggs had elicited all this attention. “There’s no Max on the menu,” the waitress said, grinning. “I said Max?” Bethanne asked, startled to realize she deserved the looks Annie and Ruth were sending her. The waitress continued to grin. “I guess one of you ladies is missing her man.” “My mother is not missing that…biker,” Annie snapped. Ruth refused to meet her eyes. Bethanne’s hand tightened on the menu. “Would you both feel better if I said Grant’s name?” The answer was obvious. Then, glancing at the waitress, she said, “Grant is my ex-husband.” “But he wants to get back together with my mom,” Annie explained. “My son was an idiot, but he’s regained his sanity just in time for my daughter-in-law to lose hers,” Ruth said in a disgruntled voice. The waitress stood there, holding the pad and pen, her gaze wandering from one to the other. “Ladies, I’m no Dr. Laura. All I do around here is take orders and fill coffee cups. If you want advice, I suggest you turn on the radio.” “I’ll have a latte.” Bethanne decided to forgo the scrambled eggs, as her appetite was gone. The waitress wrote down the order, hesitated a moment and then slid into the booth next to Bethanne. “You really should have some protein for breakfast.” “All I want is a latte.” “You got man problems, don’t you, sweetie?” she said, ignoring both Ruth and Annie. “I don’t normally get involved with customers but I’ve been married a time or two myself, and it seems to me it takes a real man to admit when he’s wrong.” She shook her head. “It doesn’t happen often.” “I keep trying to tell Mom that,” Annie insisted. “Did this ex-husband of yours drink too much?” she asked. “No,” Bethanne said. “He didn’t slap you around, did he?” “No!” “Chase skirts?” “Just the once.” It was Annie who answered. “And that was a big mistake.” “It always is,” the waitress said. “Half the time men’s brains are located below their belt buckles. Eventually they come to their senses but by then it’s usually too late.” “Eunice.” The cook stuck his head out of the kitchen. “Are you fraternizing with the customers again?” Eunice rolled her eyes. “If I don’t watch myself I’m going to lose this job.” She hurried toward the kitchen and put their order on a hanging circular device for the cook to grab. “What a sweetheart,” Ruth murmured. “Wise, too,” Annie said pointedly. “I can tell Eunice has been around the block a couple of times and found her way home,” Ruth said. “I’m leaving her an extra-big tip.” Bethanne felt embarrassed about having her personal situation aired in front of a stranger, no matter how sympathetic, and furious at her daughter and mother-in-law. And yet… She’d begun to think they were right. Regardless of her infatuation with Max, she felt she had to give her ex-husband an honest chance. She had to give their relationship an honest chance, and she couldn’t do that with Max hovering in the background. Five minutes later, Eunice returned with their breakfast order. Lost in her thoughts, Bethanne sipped her latte. Thankfully, neither Annie nor Ruth appeared to notice how distracted she was. When she saw Max the night before last, she’d told him she’d call after the wedding. But it wouldn’t be fair to keep him waiting and guessing. The only decent thing to do was call him now and explain that she wouldn’t be contacting him in the future. Bethanne slid out of her booth and headed for the door. “Mom?” her daughter asked. “Where are you going?” “I need to make a phone call” was all she was willing to tell either Annie or Ruth. Standing in the parking lot, Bethanne took out her cell phone. Max had programmed in his number and she hit speed dial, knowing she was about to do something irrevocable. She felt regretful, but relieved, too. Closing her eyes, she leaned against the rental car and silently prayed he’d answer. He picked up on the third ring, but at the sound of his voice, she suddenly couldn’t speak. “Hello,” he said again. After a long moment, his voice softened. “Is that you, Bethanne?” “Yes.” He waited for her to continue. “I won’t be calling you.” Then, because she owed him an explanation, she rushed to say, “I’m truly sorry, but I’ve made my decision.” Her announcement was met with stark silence. “Did you hear me?” she asked. “I heard you.” Silence again. “Don’t you have anything to say?” she demanded. “You’re going back to Grant?” “Yes…” “Your final decision?” “Yes…” It was her final decision—to give a new relationship with her ex-husband every opportunity to succeed. That didn’t guarantee success, of course, but she could only go into this with an open heart. Without reservations. She couldn’t have one eye on the exit as she and Grant tried out their new roles. “You don’t sound convinced.” “I am completely convinced that this is the right thing to do.” “Then why did you call me now?” “I didn’t want you waiting to hear from me.” “Did you assume I was waiting?” “You were, weren’t you?” That was the way she remembered their discussion when they’d parted in Vegas. “What happened? You only left Vegas two days ago.” “Grant phoned and he’s coming to Florida and…and I can’t stop thinking about you and it’s causing all kinds of problems.” She hadn’t intended to admit all that, but it slipped out. “To top everything, we went for breakfast and instead of ordering scrambled eggs, I ordered you.” She could sense his smile. “This isn’t funny, Max.” “I’ve been thinking a lot about you, too. Kate would’ve liked you.” “I can’t do this, Max. I mean it.” “I know.” “You don’t believe me, do you?” “No.” He didn’t even bother to pretend otherwise, which frustrated her. “You won’t be hearing from me again,” she said, trying to sound firm. “Okay. If that’s what you want.” She felt like stamping her foot. “Why don’t you believe me?” “Are you really going back to your ex-husband?” She didn’t respond for a moment. Then she said in a low voice, “I don’t know yet.” “That’s what I thought.” “He loves me,” she insisted. “And you love him,” Max said. “I understand that. But do you love him enough?” “We have children together, a twenty-year history as husband and wife. I already told you all this.” “That doesn’t answer the question.” “I don’t know how I feel. I can’t deal with this,” she whispered, and her voice cracked. “Bethanne, listen,” Max said, speaking softly now. “This doesn’t have to be decided this very minute. I thought we were going to connect after your son’s wedding. It’s in July, right?” “July 16.” “You have lots of time. We both do.” Despite what he’d said about understanding, he really didn’t. No one did. “I want this over now. I can’t be seriously considering getting back with Grant and dreaming about you. Why you? Oh, Max, why does it have to be you? Of all the men I’ve dated in the past six years, none of them made me feel the way you do.” “Me, too,” he whispered, his voice husky. “No one. Not ever. I loved Kate, adored her, but that was…different.” Neither spoke for what seemed like a long time. Then Bethanne saw Annie and Ruth walking out of the restaurant. “I need to get off the phone.” “Where are you?” “Albuquerque.” Fearing he might try to find her, she added, “Don’t come. Please don’t try to follow me.” “I won’t.” “Goodbye, Max.” “Goodbye.” Annie was staring intently at her and so was Ruth. Rather than say anything more, Bethanne snapped her cell shut and dropped it in her purse. “Who was that?” Ruth asked. Bethanne felt incredibly guilty and guessed she must look it, too. But she didn’t respond. She had a right to her private conversations, dammit! Ironically, she’d been trying to do something that should please them. “You were talking to Max, weren’t you?” Annie said. Not waiting for a reply, both women turned toward the parking lot. Bethanne went back inside the restaurant, to the ladies’ room. Her nerves were a mess. Instead of feeling better after talking to Max, she felt worse. She hadn’t settled a thing. Quite the contrary; she’d muddled her thoughts and emotions even more. Washing her hands in the empty room, Bethanne looked at herself in the mirror and announced, “I am my own woman. I will not let the dictates of my family influence my decisions.” Then she dried her hands carefully with a paper towel and left the bathroom. When she got to the car, Annie was in the driver’s seat with Ruth in the back. Bethanne climbed into the front passenger seat and closed the door. She automatically reached for her knitting. Without a word, Annie backed out of the parking space. “I have to tell you that I’m worried about you,” Ruth said, leaning forward. She apparently felt obliged to impart her misgivings. “I appreciate your concern, Ruth, but you don’t need to worry. I know what I’m doing.” “What about Dad?” Annie cried. “What about him?” Bethanne asked. She continued to work the white cashmere wool, knitting faster than she’d thought possible. Thankfully, the pattern wasn’t so complicated that she had to study every row. “He loves you! Doesn’t that matter?” “Of course it does,” Ruth answered for her. “I think we should leave your mother alone. She’s right. This is her decision.” “I’m not sure I can keep quiet,” Annie said, completely ignoring the fact that Bethanne was sitting beside her and could hear every word. “Your mother wants to return to Grant on an even playing field,” Ruth said stiffly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8/page-24.html","bookId":1940,"book":{"id":1940,"title":"A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8)","description":"Storyline: A Turn in the Road (Blossom Street #8) Six years after he had walked out on his wife and kids, Grant was freshly single again and looking to reconcile with Bethanne Hamlin. To forgive the betrayal was one thing, she did that for herself. To forget was something that she didn’t think she could ever do and she wasn’t sure if she could ever trust him again either. Being willing to at least think about it for the sake of the grown kids, herself, him, she wasn’t sure, but think about it she was. Hearing that her ex-mother-in-law was planning a road trip across the country to her 50th class reunion in Florida was the perfect excuse to get away and do that thinking. With the addition of her daughter Annie, Ruth and Bethanne set out to see America. Even though Ruth had made plans, the addition of Annie added spontaneity to the group, taking them off the plotted course early in the trip. Helping out in a diner for an old friend of Ruth’s was the fist of may changes to come. Then they have trouble with the rental car with only one source of help, and that coming from a group of motorcycle riders they met at the diner. Offering a ride to the nearest town was the best way for Max to help, but the connection they found while offering confessions may make some decisions more difficult.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-turn-in-the-road-blossom-street-8.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:09 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:24 AM"}}
