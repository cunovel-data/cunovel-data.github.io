{"id":10732,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 Going Underground","content":"ST BARTLEBY’S SCHOOL FOR YOUNG GENTLEMEN BUTLER had been in Artemis Fowl\u0027s service since the moment of the boy\u0027s birth. He had spent the first night of his charge\u0027s life standing guard on the Sisters of Mercy maternity ward. For over a decade, Butler had been teacher, mentor and protector to the young heir. The pair had never been separated for more than a week, until now. It shouldn\u0027t bother him, he knew that. A bodyguard should never become emotionally attached to his package. It affects his judgement. But in his private moments, Butler couldn\u0027t help thinking of the Fowl heir as the son or younger brother he\u0027d never had. Butler parked the Bentley Arnage Red Label on the college avenue. If anything, the Eurasian manservant had bulked up since mid-term. With Artemis in boarding school, he was spending a lot more time in the gym.Truth be told, Butler was bored pumping iron, but the college authorities absolutely refused to allow him a bunk in Artemis\u0027s room. And when the gardener had discovered the bodyguard\u0027s hideout just off the seventeenth green, they had banned him from the college grounds altogether. Artemis slipped through the college gate, Doctor Po\u0027s comments still in his thoughts. \u0027Problems, sir?\u0027 said Butler, noticing his employer\u0027s sour expression. Artemis ducked into the Bentley\u0027s wine-leather interior, selecting a still water from the bar. \u0027Hardly, Butler. Just another quack spouting psychobabble.\" Butler kept his voice level. \u0027Should I have a word with him?\u0027 \u0027Never mind him now. What news of the Fowl Star?\u0027 \u0027We got an e-mail at the manor this morning. It\u0027s an mpeg; Artemis scowled. He could not access MPEG video files on his mobile phone. Butler pulled a portable computer from the glove compartment. \u0027I thought you might be anxious to see the file, so I downloaded it on to this.\u0027 He passed the computer over his shoulder. Artemis activated the compact machine, folding out the flat colour screen. At first he thought the battery was dead, then realized he was looking at a field of snow. White on white, with only the faintest shadows to indicate dips and drumlins. Artemis felt the uneasiness rolling in his gut. Funny how such an innocent image could be so foreboding. The camera panned upwards, revealing a dull twilit sky. Then a black hunched object in the distance. A rhythmic crunching issued through the compact speakers as the cameraman advanced through the snow. The object grew clearer. It was a man sitting on, no, tied to, a chair. The ice clinked in Artemis\u0027s glass. His hands were shaking. The man was dressed in the rags of a once fine suit. Scars branded the prisoner\u0027s face like lightning bolts, and one leg appeared to be missing. It was difficult to tell. Artemis\u0027s breath was jumpy now, like a marathon runner\u0027s. There was a sign around the man\u0027s neck. Cardboard and twine. On the sign was scrawled in thick black letters: Zdmvstvutye, syn. The camera zoomed in on the message for several seconds, then went blank. \u0027Is that all?\u0027 . Butler nodded. \u0027Just the man and the sign. That\u0027s it.\u0027 \u0027Zdmvstvutye, syn,\u0027 muttered Artemis, his accent flawless. Since his father\u0027s disappearance he had been teaching himself the language. \u0027Should I translate for you?\u0027 asked Butler, also a Russian speaker. He had picked it up during a five-year stint with an espionage unit in the late eighties. His accent, however, was not quite so sophisticated as his young employer\u0027s. \u0027No, I know what it means,\u0027 replied Artemis. ‘Zdmvstvutye, syn: Hello, son.\u0027 Butler pulled the Bentley on to the dual carriageway. Neither of them spoke for several minutes. Eventually Butler had to ask. \u0027Do you think it\u0027s him, Artemis? Could that man be your father?\u0027 Artemis rewound the MPEG, freezing it on the mysterious man\u0027s face. He touched the display, sending rainbow distortions across the screen. \u0027I think so, Butler. But the picture quality is too poor. I can\u0027t be certain.\u0027 Butler understood the emotions battering his young charge. He too had lost someone aboard the Fowl Star. His uncle, the Major, had been assigned to Artemis\u0027s father on that fateful trip. Unfortunately, the Major\u0027s body had turned up in theTchersky morgue. Artemis regained his composure. \u0027I must pursue this, Butler.\u0027 \u0027You know what\u0027s coming next, of course?\u0027 \u0027Yes. A ransom demand. This is merely the teaser, to get my attention. I need to cash in some of the People\u0027s gold. Contact Lars in Zurich immediately.\u0027 Butler accelerated into the fast lane. \u0027Master Artemis, I have had some experience in these matters.\u0027 Artemis did not interrupt. Butler\u0027s career before his current charge\u0027s birth had been varied to say the least. \u0027The pattern with kidnappers is to eliminate all witnesses. Then they will generally try to eliminate each other to avoid splitting the ransom.\u0027 \u0027Your point being?\u0027 \u0027My point being that paying a ransom in no way guarantees your father\u0027s safety. If indeed that man is your father. It is quite possible that the kidnappers will take your money and then kill all of us.\u0027 Artemis studied the screen. \u0027You\u0027re right, of course. I will have to devise a plan.\u0027 Butler swallowed. He remembered the last plan. It had almost got them both killed, and could have plunged the planet into a cross-species war. Butler was a man who didn\u0027t scare easily, but the spark in Artemis Fowl\u0027s eyes was enough to send a shiver crackling down his spine. CHUTE TERMINAL EI: TARA, IRELAND Captain Holly Short had decided to work a double shift and proceed directly to the surface. She paused only for a nutri-bar and energy shake before hopping on the first shuttle to the terminal at Tara. One of Tara\u0027s officials was not making her journey any easier. The head of security was annoyed that Captain Short had not only put all chute traffic on hold to take a priority pod from El, but had then proceeded to commandeer an entire shuttle for the return journey. \u0027Why don\u0027t you check your system again?\u0027 said Holly, through gritted teeth. \u0027I\u0027m sure the authorization from Police Plaza has arrived by now.\u0027 The truculent gnome consulted his hand-held computer. \u0027No, ma\u0027am. I ain\u0027t got nuthin.\u0027 \u0027Look, Mister ...\u0027 \u0027Commandant Terryl.\u0027 \u0027Commandant Terryl. I\u0027m on an important mission here. National security. I need you to keep the arrivals hall completely clear for the next couple of hours.\u0027 Terryl made a great show of almost collapsing. \u0027The next coupl\u0027a hours! Are you crazy, girly? I got three shuttles comin\u0027 in from Atlantis. What\u0027m I s\u0027posed to tell \u0027em? Tour\u0027s off \u0027cause of some LEP secret shenanigans. This is high season. I can\u0027t just shut things down. No way, no how.\u0027 Holly shrugged. \u0027Fine. You just let all your tourists catch sight of the two humans I\u0027m bringing down here. There\u0027ll be a riot. I guarantee it.\u0027 \u0027Two humans?\u0027 said the head of security. \u0027Inside the terminal? Are you nuts?\u0027 Holly was running out of patience, and time. \u0027Do you see this?\u0027 she demanded, pointing to the insignia on her helmet. \u0027I\u0027m LEP. A captain. No rent-a-cop gnome is going to stand in the way of my orders.\u0027 Terryl drew himself up to his full height, which was about seventy centimetres. \u0027Yeah, I heard a you. The crazy girly captain. Caused quite a stir up here last year, didn\u0027t you? My tax ingots gonna be payin\u0027 for that little screw-up for quite some time.\u0027 \u0027Just ask Central, you bureaucratic idiot.\u0027 \u0027Call me what you want, missy. We have our rules here, and without confirmation from below, ain\u0027t nuthin I can do to change \u0027em. \u0027Specially not fer some gun-totin\u0027 girly with an attitude problem.\u0027 \u0027Well get on the blower to Police Plaza then!\u0027 Terryl sniffed. \u0027The magma flares have just started actin\u0027 up. It\u0027s hard to get a line. Maybe I\u0027ll try again, after my rounds. Just you take yourself a seat in the departure lounge.\u0027 Holly\u0027s hand strayed towards her buzz baton. \u0027You know what you\u0027re doing, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 croaked the gnome. \u0027You\u0027re obstructing an LEP operation.\u0027 \u0027I ain\u0027t obstructin\u0027 nuthin \u0027And, as such, it is in my power to remove said obstruction using any force that I deem necessary.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t you threaten me, missy.\u0027 Holly drew the baton, twirling it expertly. \u0027I\u0027m not threatening you. I\u0027m just informing you of police procedure. If you continue to obstruct me, I remove the obstruction, in this case you, and proceed to the next in command.\u0027 Terryl was unconvinced. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t dare.\u0027 Holly grinned. \u0027I\u0027m the crazy girly captain. Remember?\u0027 The gnome considered it. It was unlikely the officer would buzz him, but then again who knew with female elves? \u0027OK,\u0027 he said, printing off a sheet on the computer. \u0027This is a twenty-four-hour visa. But if you\u0027re not back here in that time, I\u0027ll have you taken into custody on your return. Then I\u0027ll be the one making the threats.\u0027 Holly snatched the sheet. \u0027Whatever. Now, remember, make sure Arrivals is clear when I get back.\u0027 IRELAND, EN ROUTE FROM ST BARTLEBY\u0027S TO FOWL MANOR Artemis was bouncing ideas off Butler. It was a technique he often used when trying to come up with a plan. After all, if anybody was an expert on covert operations, it was his bodyguard. \u0027We can\u0027t trace the MPEG?\u0027 \u0027No, Artemis. I tried. They put a decay virus in with the e-mail. I only just managed to get the film on disk before the original disintegrated.\u0027 \u0027What about the MPEG itself? Could we get a geographical fix from the stars?\u0027 Butler smiled. Young Master Artemis was starting to think like a soldier. \u0027No luck. I sent a shot to a friend of mine in NASA. He didn\u0027t even bother putting it into the computer. Not enough definition.\u0027 Artemis was silent for a minute. \u0027How fast can we get to Russia?\u0027 Butler drummed his fingers on the steering wheel. \u0027It depends.\u0027 \u0027Depends on what?\u0027 \u0027On how we go, legal or illegal.\u0027 \u0027Which is quicker?\u0027 Butler laughed. Something you didn\u0027t hear very often. \u0027Illegal is usually faster. Either way is going to be pretty slow. We can\u0027t go by air, that\u0027s for sure. The Mafiya are going to have foot soldiers at every airstrip.\u0027 \u0027Are we sure it\u0027s the Mafiya?\u0027 Butler glanced in the rear-view mirror. \u0027I\u0027m afraid so. All kidnappings go through the Mafiya. Even if an ordinary criminal managed to abduct your father, he would have to hand him over once the Mafiya had found out about it.\u0027 Artemis nodded. \u0027That\u0027s what I thought. So we will have to travel by sea, and that will take a week at the very least. We could really use some help with transport. Something the Mafiya won\u0027t expect. How\u0027s our ID situation?\u0027 \u0027No problem. I thought we\u0027d go native. We\u0027ll arouse less suspicion. I have passports and visas.\u0027 \u0027Da. What is our cover?\u0027 \u0027What about Stefan Bashkir and his Uncle Constantin?\u0027 \u0027Perfect. The chess prodigy and his chaperone.\u0027 They had used this cover many times before on previous search missions. Once, a checkpoint official, himself a chess grandmaster, had doubted their story until Artemis beat him in six moves. The technique had since become known as the Bashkir Manoeuvre. \u0027How soon can we leave?\u0027 \u0027Almost immediately. Missus Fowl and Juliet are in Nice this week. That gives us eight days. We can mail the school, make up some excuse.\u0027 \u0027I dare say St Bartleby\u0027s will be glad to be rid of me for a while.\u0027 \u0027We could go straight to the airport from Fowl Manor. The Lear jet is stocked. At least we can fly as far as Scandinavia and we can try to pick up a boat from there. I just have to pick up a few things at the manor first.\u0027 Artemis could imagine exactly the kind of things his manservant wished to pick up. Sharp things and explosive things. \u0027Good. The sooner the better. We\u0027ve got to find these people before they know we\u0027re looking. We can monitor e-mail as we go.\u0027 Butler took the exit for Fowl Manor. \u0027You know, Artemis,\u0027 he said, glancing in the mirror. \u0027We\u0027re going up against the Russian Mafiya. I\u0027ve had dealings with these people before. They don\u0027t negotiate. This could get bloody. If we take these gangsters on, people are going to get hurt. Most likely us.\u0027 Artemis nodded absently, watching his own reflection in the window. He needed a plan. Something audacious and brilliant. Something that had never been attempted before. Artemis was not unduly worried on that front. His brain had never let him down. TARA SHUTTLE PORT The fairy shuttle port at Tara was an impressive operation. Ten thousand cubic metres of terminal concealed beneath an overgrown hillock in the middle of the McGraney farm. For centuries, the McGraneys had respected the fairy fort\u0027s boundaries and, for centuries, they had enjoyed exceptional good luck. Illnesses mysteriously cleared up overnight. Priceless art treasures unearthed themselves with incredible regularity, and mad cow disease seemed to avoid their herds altogether. Having solved her visa problem, Holly finally made her way to the security door and slipped through the holographic camouflage. She had managed to secure a set of Koboi DoubleDex for the trip. The rig ran on a satellite-bounced solar battery, and employed a revolutionary wing design.There were two sets, or decks; one fixed for gliding, and a smaller set for manoeuvrability. Holly had been dying to try out the DoubleDex, but only a few rigs had made their way across from Koboi Labs. Foaly was reluctant to let them out because he hadn\u0027t designed them. Professional envy. Holly had taken advantage of his absence from the lab to swipe a set from the rack. She soared fifteen metres above the ground, allowing unfiltered surface air to fill her lungs. Though laden with pollutants, it was still sweeter than the recycled tunnel variety. For several minutes, she enjoyed the experience, before turning her concentration to the mission at hand: how to abduct Artemis Fowl. Not from his home, Fowl Manor, that was for certain. Legally, she put herself on very shaky ground by entering a dwelling without permission. Even though, technically, Fowl had invited her in by kidnapping her last year. Not many lawyers would take your case on the basis of that defence. Anyway, the manor was a virtual fortress and had already seen off an entire LEPretrieval team. Why should she fare any better? There was also the complication that Artemis could very welt be expecting her, especially if he was trading with the B\u0027wa Kell.The idea of walking into a trap did not appeal to Holly. She had already been imprisoned once in Fowl Manor. Doubtless her cell was still furnished. Holly activated the computer navigation package, calling up Fowl Manor on her helmet visor. A soft crimson light began to blip beside the 3D plan of the house. The building had been red-flagged by the LEP. Holly groaned. Now she would be treated to a video warning, just in case there was one Recon officer under the world who had not heard of Artemis Fowl. Corporal Lili Frond\u0027s face appeared on the screen. Of course they chose Lili for this assignment. The bimbo face of the LEP. Sexism was alive and well and living in Police Plaza. It was rumoured that Frond\u0027s LEP scores had been bumped up because of her descendancy from the elfin king. \u0027You have selected Fowl Manor,\u0027 said Frond\u0027s image, fluttering her eyelids. \u0027This is a red-flagged building. Unauthorized access is strictly forbidden. Do not even attempt a fly-over. Artemis Fowl is considered an active threat to the People.\u0027 A picture of Fowl appeared beside Frond, a digitally enhanced scowl on his face. \u0027His accomplice, known only as Butler, is not to be approached under any circumstances. He is generally armed and always dangerous.\u0027 Butler\u0027s massive head appeared beside the two other images. Armed and dangerous hardly did him justice. He was the only human in history to have taken on a troll and won. Holly sent the co-ordinates to the flight computer and let the wings do the steering for her. The countryside sped by below. Even since her last visit, the Mud People infestation seemed to have taken a stronger hold. There was barely an acre of land without dozens of their dwellings digging into its soil, and barely a mile of river without one of their factories pouring its poison into the waters. The sun finally dipped below the horizon and Holly raised the filters on her visor. Time was on her side now. She had the entire night to come up with a plan. Holly found that she missed Foaly\u0027s sarcastic comments in her ear. Annoying as the centaur\u0027s observations were, they generally proved accurate and had saved her hide on more than one occasion. She tried to establish a link, but the flares were still high and there was no reception. Nothing but static. Fowl Manor loomed in the distance, completely dominating the surrounding landscape. Holly scanned the building with her thermal bar and found nothing but insect and small rodent life forms. Spiders and mice. Nobody home. That suited her fine. She landed on the head of a particularly gruesome stone gargoyle, and settled in to wait. FOWL MANOR, DUBLIN, IRELAND The original Fowl castle had been built by Lord Hugh Fowl in the fifteenth century, overlooking low-lying country on all sides. A tactic borrowed from the Normans: never let your enemies sneak up on you. Over the centuries, the castle had been extensively remodelled until it became a manor, but the attention to security remained. The manor was surrounded by metre-thick walls, and wired with a state-of-the-art security system. Butler pulled off the road, opening the estate gates with a remote. He glanced back at his employer\u0027s pensive face. Sometimes he thought that, in spite of all his contacts, informants and employees, Artemis Fowl was the loneliest boy he\u0027d ever met. \u0027We could bring a couple of those fairy blasters,\u0027 he said. Butler had relieved LEPretrieval One of their weaponry during the previous year\u0027s siege. Artemis nodded. \u0027Good idea, but remove the nuclear batteries and put the blasters in a bag with some old games and books. We can pretend they\u0027re toys if we\u0027re captured.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir. Good thinking.\u0027 The Bentley Red Label crunched up the driveway, activating the ground\u0027s security lights. There were several lamps on in the main house. These were on randomly alternating timers. Butler undid his seat belt, stepping lithely from the Bentley. \u0027You need anything special, Artemis?\u0027 Artemis nodded. \u0027Grab some caviar from the kitchen. You wouldn\u0027t believe the muck they feed us in Bartleby\u0027s for ten thousand a term.\u0027 Butler smiled again. A teenager asking for caviar. He\u0027d never get used to it. The smile withered on his lips halfway to the recently remodelled entrance. A shiver passed across his heart. He knew that feeling well. His mother used to say that someone had just walked over his grave. A sixth sense. Gut instinct. There was peril somewhere. Invisible, but here nevertheless. Holly spotted the headlights raking the sky from over a mile away. Optix were no good from this vantage point. Even when the automobile\u0027s windscreen came into view, the glass was tinted and the shadows beyond were deep. She felt her heart rate increase at the sight of Fowl\u0027s car. The Bentley wound along the avenue, flickering between the rows of willow and horse chestnut. Holly ducked instinctively, though she was completely shielded from human eyes. You couldn\u0027t be certain with Artemis Fowl\u0027s manservant. Last year Artemis had cannibalized a fairy helmet, constructing an eyepiece that allowed Butler to spot and neutralize an entire crack squad of LEPretrieval commandos. It was hardly likely that he was wearing the lens at the moment but, as Trouble Kelp and his boys had learned, it didn\u0027t pay to underestimate Artemis or his manservant. Holly set the Neutrino to slightly above the recommended stun setting. A couple of Butler\u0027s brain cells might get fried, but she wasn\u0027t about to lose any sleep over it. The car swung into the driveway, crunching across the gravel. Butler climbed out. Holly felt her back teeth grinding. Once upon a time, she had saved his life, healing him after a mortal encounter with a troll. She wasn\u0027t sure if she\u0027d do it again. Holding her breath, LEPrecon Captain Holly Short set the DoubleDex to slow descent. She dropped soundlessly, skimming past the storeys, and aimed her weapon at Butler\u0027s chest. Now there was a target a sun-blinded dwarf couldn\u0027t miss. The human couldn\u0027t have detected her presence. Not possible. Yet something made him pause. He stopped and sniffed the air. The Mud Man was like a dog. No, not a dog, a wolf. A wolf with a big handgun. Holly focused her helmet lens on the weapon, sending a photo to her computer database. Moments later, a hi-res rotating 3D image of the gun appeared in the corner of her visor. \u0027Sig Sauer,\u0027 said a recorded byte of Foaly\u0027s voice. \u0027Nine millimetre. Thirteen in the magazine. Big bullets. One of these hits you and it could blow your head off; something even the magic can\u0027t fix. Other than that you should be all right, presuming you remembered to wear the regulation above-ground micro-fibre jumpsuit recently patented by me. Then again, being a Recon jock, you probably didn\u0027t.\u0027 Holly scowled. Foaly was all the more annoying when he was right. She had jumped on the first available shuttle without even bothering to change into an above-ground suit. Holly\u0027s eyes were level with Butler\u0027s now, yet she was still hovering over a metre from the ground. She released the visor seals, wincing at the pneumatic hiss. Butler heard the escaping gas, swinging the Sig Sauer towards the source. \u0027Fairy,\u0027 he said. \u0027I know you\u0027re there. Unshield or I start shooting.\u0027 This was not exactly the tactical advantage Holly had in mind. Her visor was up, and the manservant\u0027s finger was creaking on his pistol\u0027s hair trigger. She took a deep breath and shut down her shield. \u0027Hello, Butler,\u0027 she said evenly. Butler cocked the Sig Sauer. \u0027Hello, Captain. Come down slowly, and don\u0027t try any of your ...\u0027 \u0027Put your gun away,\u0027 said Holly, her voice layered with the hypnotic mesmer. Butler fought it, the gun barrel shaking erratically. \u0027Put it down, Butler. Don\u0027t make me fry your brain.\u0027 A vein pulsed in Butler\u0027s eyelid. Unusual, thought Holly. I\u0027ve never seen that before. \u0027Don\u0027t fight me, Mud Man. Give in to it.\u0027 Butler opened his mouth to speak. To warn Artemis. She pushed harder, the magic cascading around the human\u0027s head. \u0027I said put it down!\u0027 A bead of sweat ran down the bodyguard\u0027s cheek. \u0027PUT IT DOWN!\u0027 And Butler did, gradually and grudgingly. Holly smiled. \u0027Good, Mud Man. Now, back to the car and act as though nothing\u0027s wrong.\u0027 The manservant\u0027s legs obeyed, ignoring the signals from his own brain. Holly buzzed up her shield. She was going to enjoy this. Artemis was composing an e-mail on his laptop. Dear Principal Guiney ... it read ... Because of your counsellor\u0027s tactless interrogation of my little Arty, I have taken him out of school for a course of therapy sessions with real professionals in the Mont Gaspard Clinic in Switzerland. I am considering legal action. Do not attempt to contact me as that would only serve to irritate me further and, when irritated, I generally call my attorneys. Sincerely, Angeline Fowl Artemis sent the message, allowing himself the luxury of a small grin. It would have been nice to watch Principal Guiney\u0027s expression when he read the electronic letter. Unfortunately, the button camera he\u0027d planted in the headmaster\u0027s office could only be accessed within a mile radius. Butler opened the driver\u0027s door and, after a moment, slipped into the seat. Artemis folded his phone into its wallet. \u0027Captain Short, I presume. Why don\u0027t you stop vibrating and settle into the visible spectrum?\u0027 Holly speckled into view. There was a gleaming gun in her hand. Guess where it was pointed. \u0027Really, Holly, is that necessary?\u0027 Holly snorted. \u0027Well, let\u0027s see. Kidnapping, actual bodily harm, extortion, conspiracy to commit murder. I\u0027d say it\u0027s necessary.\u0027 \u0027Please, Captain Short,\u0027 said Artemis, with a smile, \u0027I was young and selfish. Believe it or not, I do harbour some doubts over that particular venture.\u0027 \u0027Not enough doubts to return the gold?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 admitted Artemis. \u0027Not quite.\u0027 \u0027How did you know I was here?\u0027 Artemis steepled his fingers. \u0027There were several clues. One, Butler did not conduct his usual bomb check under the car. Two, he returned without the items he went to fetch. Three, the door was left open for several seconds, something no good security man would permit. And four, I detected a slight haze as you entered the vehicle. Elementary really.\u0027 Holly scowled. \u0027Observant little Mud Boy, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027I try. Now, Captain Short, if you would be so kind as to tell me why you are here.\u0027 \u0027As if you don\u0027t know.\u0027 Artemis thought for a moment. \u0027Interesting. I would guess that something has happened. Obviously something that I am being held responsible for.\u0027 He raised an eyebrow fractionally. An intense expression of emotion for Artemis Fowl. \u0027There are humans trading with the People.\u0027 \u0027Very impressive,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Or it would be if we didn\u0027t both know that you\u0027re behind it. And if we can\u0027t get the truth out of you, I\u0027m sure your computer files will prove most revealing.\u0027 Artemis closed the laptop\u0027s lid. \u0027Captain. I realize there is no love lost between us, but I don\u0027t have time for this now. It is imperative that you give me a few days to sort out my affairs.\u0027 \u0027No can do, Fowl. There are a few people below ground who would like a word.\u0027 Artemis shrugged. \u0027I suppose after what I did, I can\u0027t really expect any consideration.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right. You can\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Well then,\u0027 sighed Artemis. \u0027I don\u0027t suppose I have a choice.\u0027 Holly smiled. \u0027That\u0027s right, Fowl, you don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Shall we go?\u0027 Artemis\u0027s tone was meek, but his brain was sparking off ideas. Maybe co-operating with the fairies wasn\u0027t such a bad idea. They had certain abilities after all. \u0027Why not?\u0027 Holly turned to Butler. \u0027Drive south. Stay on the back roads.\u0027 \u0027Tara, I presume. I often wondered where exactly the entrance to El was.\u0027 \u0027Keep wondering, Mud Boy,\u0027 muttered Holly. \u0027Now, sleep. All this deduction is wearing me out.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/247.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
