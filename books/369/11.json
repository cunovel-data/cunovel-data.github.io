But he couldn\u0027t do anything with them. He couldn\u0027t even call up Julius and pester him with his hair-brained schemes. Fowl\u0027s laptop seemed to be the centaur\u0027s only weapon. It was like trying to fight a troll with a toothpick.\n Not that the human computer was without some merit, in an ancient-history kind of a way. The e-mail had already proved useful. Provided there was anybody alive to answer it. There was also a small camera mounted on the lid, for video-conferencing. Something the Mud People had only come up with recently. Until then, humans had communicated purely through text or sound waves. Foaly tutted, barbarians. But this camera was pretty high quality, with several filter options. If the centaur didn\u0027t know better, he\u0027d swear someone had been leaking fairy technology.\n Foaly swivelled the laptop with his hoof, pointing the camera towards the screens on the wall. Come on, Cudgeon, he thought. Smile for the birdie.\n He didn\u0027t have long to wait. Within minutes, a com screen flickered into life and Cudgeon appeared, waving a white flag.\n \u0027Nice touch,\u0027 commented Foaly sarcastically.\n \u0027I thought so,\u0027 said the elf, waving the pennant theatrically. \u0027I\u0027m going to need this later.\u0027\n Cudgeon pressed a button on the remote control. \u0027Why don\u0027t I show you what\u0027s going on outside?\u0027\n The windows cleared to reveal several squads of technicians feverishly trying to break the booth\u0027s defences. Most were aiming computer sensors at the booth\u0027s various interfaces, but some were doing it the old-fashioned way. Whacking the sensors with big hammers. None were having any luck.\n Foaly swallowed. He was a rat in a trap. \u0027Why don\u0027t you fill me in on your plan, Briar? Isn\u0027t that what the power-crazed villain usually does?\u0027\n Cudgeon settled back into his swivel chair. \u0027Certainly, Foaly. Because this isn\u0027t one of your precious human movies. There will be no hero rushing in at the last moment. Short and Root are already dead. As are their human partners. No reprieve, no rescue. Just certain death.\u0027\n Foaly knew he should be feeling sadness, but hatred was all he could find.\n \u0027Just when things are at their most desperate, I shall instruct Opal to return weapons control to the LEP. The B\u0027wa Kell will be rendered unconscious, and you will be blamed for the entire affair, provided you survive, which I doubt.\u0027\n \u0027When the B\u0027wa Kell recover, they will name you.\u0027\n Cudgeon wagged a finger. \u0027Only a handful know I am involved, and I shall take care of them personally. They have already been summoned to Koboi Labs. I shall join them shortly. The DNA cannons are being calibrated to reject goblin strands. When the time comes I shall activate them, and the entire squadron will be out for the count.\u0027\n \u0027And then Opal Koboi becomes your empress, I suppose?\u0027\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Cudgeon aloud. But then he manipulated the remote\u0027s keyboard, making certain they were on a secure channel.\n \u0027Empress?\u0027 he breathed. \u0027Really, Foaly. Do you think I\u0027d go to all this trouble to share power? Oh no. As soon as this charade is over Miss Koboi will have a tragic accident. Perhaps several tragic accidents.\u0027\n Foaly bristled. \u0027At the risk of sounding cliched, Briar, you\u0027ll never get away with this.\u0027\n Cudgeon\u0027s finger hovered over the terminate button. \u0027Well if I don\u0027t,\u0027 he said pleasantly, \u0027you won\u0027t be alive to gloat this time.\u0027 And he was gone, leaving the centaur to sweat it out in the booth. Or so Cudgeon thought.\n Foaly reached below the desk to the laptop. \u0027And cut,\u0027 he murmured, pausing the camera. \u0027Take five, people, that\u0027s a wrap.\u0027\n \n CHUTE EII6\n \n Holly clamped the shuttle to the wall of a disused chute.\n \u0027We got about thirty minutes. Internal sensors say there\u0027s a flare coming up here in half an hour, and no shuttle is built to withstand that kind of heat.\u0027\n They gathered in the pressurized lounge to put together a plan.\n \u0027We need to break into Koboi Labs and regain control of the LEP weaponry,\u0027 said the commander.\n Mulch was out of his chair and heading for the door. \u0027No way, Julius. That place has been upgraded since I was there. I heard they\u0027ve got DNA-coded cannons.\u0027\n Root grabbed the dwarf by the scruff of his neck. \u0027One, don\u0027t call me Julius. And two, you\u0027re acting like you have a choice, convict.\u0027\n Mulch glared at him. \u0027I do have a choice, Julius. I can just serve out my sentence in a nice little cell. Putting me in the line of fire is a violation of my civil rights.\u0027\n Root\u0027s facial tones alternated from pastel pink to turnip purple. \u0027Civil rights!\u0027 he spluttered. \u0027You\u0027re talking to me about civil rights! Isn\u0027t that just typical?\u0027\n Then, strangely, he calmed down. In fact, he seemed almost happy. Those who were close to the commander knew that when he was happy, somebody else was about to be extremely sad.\n \u0027What?\u0027 asked Mulch suspiciously.\n Root lit one of his noxious fungus cigars. \u0027Oh, nothing. Just that you\u0027re right, that\u0027s all.\u0027\n The dwarf squinted. \u0027I\u0027m right? You\u0027re saying, in front of witnesses, that I\u0027m right.\u0027\n \u0027Certainly you are. Putting you in the line of fire would violate every right in the book. So, instead of cutting you the fantastic deal that I was about to offer, I\u0027m going to add a couple of centuries to your sentence and throw you in maximum security.\u0027 Root paused, blowing a cloud of smoke at Mulch\u0027s face. \u0027In Howler\u0027s Peak.\u0027\n Mulch paled beneath the mud caking his cheeks. \u0027Howler\u0027s Peak? But that\u0027s a ...\u0027\n \u0027A goblin prison,\u0027 completed the commander. \u0027I know. But for an obvious escape risk such as yourself, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have any trouble convincing the board to make an exception.\u0027\n Mulch dropped into the padded gyro chair. This wasn\u0027t good. The last time he\u0027d been in a cell with goblins, it hadn\u0027t been any fun. And that had been in Police Plaza. He wouldn\u0027t last a week in general population.\n \u0027So what was this deal?\u0027\n Artemis smiled, fascinated: Commander Root was smarter than he looked. Then again, it would be almost impossible not to be.\n \u0027Oh, now you\u0027re interested?\u0027\n \u0027I might be. No promises, mind.\u0027\n \u0027OK, here it is. One-time offer. Don\u0027t even bother bargaining. You get us into Koboi Labs and I give you a two-day head start when this is over.\u0027\n Mulch swallowed. That was a good offer. They must be in a whole lot of trouble.\n \n POLICE PLAZA\n \n Things were hotting up at Police Plaza. The monsters were at the door. Literally. Captain Kelp was running between stations, trying to reassure his men.\n \u0027Don\u0027t worry, people, they can\u0027t get through those doors with Softnoses. Nothing less than some kind of missile —\u0027\n At that moment, a tremendous force buckled the main doors, like a child blowing up a paper bag. They held. Barely.\n Cudgeon came rushing out of the tactical room, his commander\u0027s acorns glinting on his breast. With his reinstatement by the Council, he had made history by becoming the only commander in the LEP to have been appointed twice.\n \u0027What was that?\u0027\n Trouble brought up a front view on the monitors. A goblin stood with a large tube on his shoulder.\n \u0027Bazooka of some kind. I think it\u0027s one of the old wide-bore Softnose cannons.\u0027\n Cudgeon smacked his own forehead. \u0027Don\u0027t tell me. They were all supposed to have been destroyed. A curse on that centaur! How did he manage to sneak all that hardware out from under my nose?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be too hard on yourself,\u0027 said Trouble. \u0027He fooled all of us.\u0027\n \u0027How much more of that can we stand?\u0027\n Trouble shrugged. \u0027Not much. A couple more hits. Maybe they only had one missile.\u0027\n Famous last words. The doorway shook a second time; large chunks of masonry tumbled from the marble pillars.\n Trouble picked himself off the ground, magic zipping a gash on his forehead. \u0027Paramedics, check for casualties. Have we got those weapons charged yet?\u0027\n Grub hobbled over, hampered by the weight of two electric rifles. \u0027Ready to go, Captain. Thirty-two weapons. Twenty pulses each.\u0027\n \u0027OK. Best marks-fairies only. Not one shot fired until I give the word.\u0027\n Grub nodded, his face grim and pale.\n \u0027Good, Corporal, now move it out.\u0027\n When his brother was out of earshot, Trouble spoke quietly to Commander Cudgeon. \u0027I don\u0027t know what to tell you, Commander. They blew the Atlantis tunnel, so there\u0027s no help coming from there. We can\u0027t get a pentagram around them to stop time. We\u0027re completely surrounded, outnumbered and outgunned. If the B\u0027wa Kell breaches the blast doors, it will be over in seconds. We have to get into that Operations\u0027 booth. Any progress?\u0027\n Cudgeon shook his head. \u0027The techies are working on it. We have sensors pointed at every centimetre of the surface. If we hit on the access code, it will be blind luck.\u0027\n Trouble rubbed the tiredness from his eyes. \u0027I need time. There must be a way to stall them.\u0027\n Cudgeon drew a white flag from inside his tunic. \u0027There is a way\n \u0027Commander! You can\u0027t go out there. It\u0027s suicide.\u0027\n \u0027Perhaps,\u0027 admitted the commander. \u0027But if I don\u0027t go, we could all be dead in a matter of minutes. At least this way, we\u0027ll have a few minutes to work on the Operations\u0027 booth.\u0027\n Trouble considered it. There was no other way. \u0027What have you got to bargain with?\u0027\n \u0027The prisoners in Howler\u0027s Peak. Maybe we could negotiate some kind of controlled release.\u0027\n \u0027The Council will never go for that.\u0027\n Cudgeon drew himself up to his full height. \u0027This is not a time for politics, Captain. This is a time for action.\u0027\n Trouble was, quite frankly, amazed. This was not the same Briar Cudgeon he knew. Someone had given this fairy a spine transplant.\n Now the newly appointed commander was going to earn that acorn cluster on his lapel. Trouble felt an emotion well up in his chest. One that he\u0027d never before associated with Briar Cudgeon. It was respect.\n \u0027Open the front door a crack,\u0027 ordered the commander in steely tones. Foaly would be just loving this on camera. \u0027I\u0027m going out to talk to these reptiles.\u0027\n \n Trouble relayed the command. If they ever got out of this, he would see to it that Commander Cudgeon was awarded a posthumous Golden Acorn. At the very least.\n \n UNCHARTED CHUTE, BELOW KOBOI LABORATORIES\n \n The Atlantean shuttle sped down a vast chute, sticking tightly to the walls. Close enough to scrape paint from the hull.\n Artemis poked his head through from the passenger bay.\n \u0027Is this really necessary, Captain?\u0027 he asked, as they avoided death by a centimetre for the umpteenth time. \u0027Or is it just more fly-boy grandstanding?\u0027\n Holly winked. \u0027Do I look like a fly boy to you, Fowl?\u0027\n Artemis had to admit that she didn\u0027t. Captain Short was extremely pretty in a dangerous sort of way. Black-widow pretty. Artemis was expecting puberty to hit in approximately eight months, and he suspected that at that point he would look at Holly in a different light. It was probably just as well that she was eighty years old.\n \u0027I\u0027m hugging the surface to search for this alleged crack that Mulch insists is along here,\u0027 Holly explained.\n Artemis nodded. The dwarf\u0027s theory. Just incredible enough to be true. He returned to the aft bay for Mulch\u0027s version of a briefing.\n The dwarf had drawn a crude diagram on a backlit wall panel. In fairness, there were more artistic chimpanzees. And less pungent ones. Mulch was using a carrot as a pointer — or, more accurately, several carrots. Dwarfs liked carrots.\n \u0027This is Koboi Labs,\u0027 he mumbled around a mouthful of vegetable.\n \u0027That?\u0027 exclaimed Root.\n \u0027I realize, Julius, that it is not an accurate schematic.\u0027\n The commander exploded from his chair. If you didn\u0027t know better, you\u0027d swear there was dwarf gas involved. \u0027An accurate schematic? It\u0027s a rectangle, for heaven\u0027s sake!\u0027\n Mulch was unperturbed. \u0027That\u0027s not important. This is the important bit.\u0027\n \u0027That wobbly line?\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s a fissure,\u0027 protested the dwarf. \u0027Anybody can see that.\u0027\n \u0027Anybody in kindergarten, maybe. So it\u0027s a fissure, so what?\u0027\n \u0027This is the clever bit.Y\u0027see, that fissure is not usually there.\u0027\n Root began strangling the air again. Something he was doing more and more lately. But Artemis was suddenly interested.\n \u0027When does the fissure appear?\u0027\n But Mulch wasn\u0027t just going to give a straight answer. \u0027Us dwarfs. We know something about rocks. Been digging around \u0027em for ages.\u0027 Root\u0027s fingers began beating a tattoo on his buzz baton. \u0027What fairies don\u0027t realize is that rocks are alive. They breathe.\u0027\n Artemis nodded. \u0027Of course. Heat expansion.\u0027\n Mulch bit the carrot triumphantly. \u0027Exactly. And, of course, the opposite. They contract when they cool down.\u0027 Even Root was listening now. \u0027Koboi Labs is built on solid mantle. Three miles of rock. No way in, short of sonix warheads. And I think Opal Koboi might notice them.\u0027\n \u0027And that helps us how?\u0027\n \u0027A crack opens up in that rock when it cools down. I worked on the foundations when they were building this place. Gets you right in under the labs. Still a way to go, but at least you\u0027re in.\u0027\n The commander was sceptical. \u0027So how come Opal Koboi hasn\u0027t noticed this gaping fissure?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I wouldn\u0027t say it was gaping.\u0027\n \u0027How big?\u0027\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027Dunno. Maybe five metres. At its widest point.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s still a pretty big fissure to be sitting there all I day.\u0027\n \u0027Only it\u0027s not there all day,\u0027 interrupted Artemis. \u0027Is it, Mulch?\u0027\n \u0027All day? I wish. I\u0027d say, at a guess, this is only an approximation mind ...\"\n Root was losing his cool. Being one step behind all the time didn\u0027t agree with him.\n \u0027Tell me, convict, before I add another scorch mark to your behind!\u0027\n Mulch was injured. \u0027Stop shouting, Julius, you\u0027re curling my beard.\u0027\n Root opened the cooler, letting the icy tendrils play over his face.\n \u0027OK, Mulch. How long?\u0027\n \u0027Three minutes max. Last time I did it with a set of wings, wearing a pressure suit. Nearly got crushed and fried.\u0027\n \u0027Fried?\u0027\n \u0027Let me guess,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027The fissure only opens when the rock has contracted sufficiently. If this fissure is on a chute wall, then the coolest time would be moments before the next flare.\u0027\n Mulch winked. \u0027Smart, Mud Boy. If the rocks don\u0027t get you, the magma will.\u0027\n Holly\u0027s voice crackled over the com speakers. \u0027I\u0027ve got a visual on something. Could be a shadow, or it could just be a crack in the chute wall.\u0027\n Mulch did a little dance, looking very pleased with himself. Now, Julius, you can say it. I was right again! You owe me, Julius, you owe me.\u0027\n The commander rubbed the bridge of his nose. If he made it through this alive, he was never leaving the station again.\n \n KOBOI LABORATORIES\n \n Koboi Labs was surrounded by a ring of B\u0027wa Kell goblins. Armed to the teeth, tongues hanging out for blood. Cudgeon was hustled past roughly, prodded by a dozen barrels. The DNA cannons hung inoperative in their towers, for the moment. The second Cudgeon felt the B\u0027wa Kell had outlived its usefulness, then the guns would be reactivated.\n The commander was taken to the inner sanctum, and forced to his knees before Opal and the B\u0027wa Kell generals. Once the soldiers had been dismissed, Cudgeon was back on his feet and in command.\n \u0027Everything proceeds according to plan,\u0027 he announced, crossing to stroke Opal\u0027s cheek. \u0027In an hour Haven will be ours.\u0027\n General Scalene was not convinced. \u0027It would be ours a lot faster if we had some Koboi blasters.\u0027\n Cudgeon sighed patiently. \u0027We\u0027ve been through this, General. The disruption signal knocks out all neutrino weapons. If you get blasters, so will the LEP.\u0027\n Scalene shuffled into a corner, licking his eyeballs.\n Of course, that was not the only reason for denying the goblins neutrino weapons. Cudgeon had no intention of arming a group he intended to betray. As soon as the B\u0027wa Kell had disposed of the Council, Opal would return power to the LEP.\n \u0027How are things proceeding?\u0027\n Opal swivelled in her Hoverboy, legs curled beneath her. \u0027Deliciously. The main doors fell moments after you left to ... negotiate.\u0027\n Cudgeon grinned. \u0027Good thing I left. I might have been injured.\u0027\n \u0027Captain Kelp has pulled his remaining forces into the Operations\u0027 room, ringing the booth. The Council is in there too.\u0027\n \u0027Perfect,\u0027 said Cudgeon.\n Another B\u0027wa Kell general, Sputa, banged the conference table. \u0027No, Cudgeon. Far from perfect. Our brothers are wasting away in Howler\u0027s Peak.\u0027\n \u0027Patience, General Sputa,\u0027 said Cudgeon soothingly, actually laying a hand on the goblin\u0027s shoulder. \u0027As soon as Police Plaza falls, we can open the cells in Howler\u0027s Peak without resistance.\u0027\n Internally Cudgeon fumed. These idiot creatures. How he detested them. Clothed in robes fashioned from their own cast-off skin. Repulsive. Cudgeon longed to reactivate the DNA cannons and stop their jabbering for a few sweet hours.\n He caught Opal\u0027s eye. She knew what he was thinking. Her tiny teeth showed in anticipation. What a delightfully vicious creature. Which was, of course, why she had to be disposed of. Opal Koboi could never be happy as second in command.\n He dropped her a wink.\n \u0027Soon,\u0027 he mouthed silently. \u0027Soon.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/255.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
