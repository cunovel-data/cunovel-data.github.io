{"id":10737,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 9 No Safe Haven","content":"OPERATIONS\u0027 BOOTH, POLICE PLAZA FOALY was sitting in front of the LEP mainframe waiting for the results of his latest search. Extensive laser brushing of the goblin shuttle had revealed one complete and one partial thumbprint. The complete print was his own. Easily explicable as Foaly personally inspected all retired shuttle parts. The partial print could well belong to their traitor. Not enough to identify the fairy who\u0027d been running LEP technology to the B\u0027wa Kell, but certainly enough to eliminate the innocent. Cross-reference the remaining names with everybody who had shuttle-part access, and the list got considerably shorter. Foaly switched his tail contentedly. Genius. No point in being humble about it. At the moment, the computer was crunching through personnel files with the partial print. All Foaly could do was twiddle his thumbs and wait for contact with the surface team. The magma flares were still up. Very unusual. Unusual and coincidental. Foaly\u0027s suspicious train of thought was interrupted by a familiar voice. \u0027Search complete,\u0027 said the computer, in Foaly\u0027s own tones. A little vanity. \u0027Three hundred and forty-six eliminated. Forty possibles remaining.\u0027 Forty. Not bad. They could easily be interviewed. An opportunity to use the Retimager once again. But there was another way to narrow the field. \u0027Computer. Cross-reference possibles with Level Three clearance personnel.\u0027 Level Three clearance would include everybody with access to the recycling smelters. \u0027Referencing.\u0027 Of course, the computer would only accept commands from fairies whose voice patterns it was programmed to recognize. And as a further security precaution, Foaly had coded his personal log and other important files in a computer language he\u0027d based on the ancient tongue of the centaurs: Centaurian. All centaurs were a touch paranoid, and with good reason, since there were less than a hundred left. The humans had managed to kill off their cousins, the unicorns, altogether. There were probably six centaurs under the Earth who could read the language, and only one who could decipher the computer dialect. Centaurian was possibly the oldest form of writing, dating back over ten millennia to when humans first began hunting fairies. The opening paragraph of The Scrolls of Capalla, the only surviving illuminated Centaurian manuscript, read: Fairy creatures, heed this warning, On Earth, the human era is dawning. So hide, fairy, lest you be found, And make a home beneath the ground. Centaurs were known for their intellect, not their poetry. Still, Foaly felt the words were as relevant today as they had been all those centuries ago. Cudgeon knocked on the booth\u0027s security glass. Now, technically, Cudgeon shouldn\u0027t be allowed in Ops, but Foaly buzzed him through. He could never resist having a crack at the ex-commander. Cudgeon had been demoted to lieutenant following a disastrous attempt to replace Root as Recon head honcho. If it hadn\u0027t been for his family\u0027s considerable political clout, he would have been booted off the force altogether. All in all, he might have been better off in some other line of work. At least he wouldn\u0027t have had to suffer Foaly\u0027s constant teasing. ‘I have some e-forms for you to initial,\u0027 said the lieutenant, avoiding eye-contact. \u0027No problem, Commander,\u0027 chuckled the centaur. \u0027How\u0027s the plotting going? Any revolutions planned for this afternoon?\u0027 \u0027Just sign the forms please,\u0027 said Cudgeon holding out a digi-pen. His hand was shaking. Amazing, thought Foaly. This broken-down shell of an elf was once on the LEP fast track. \u0027No, but seriously, Cudgeon. You\u0027re doing a bang-up job on the form-signing thing.\u0027 Cudgeon\u0027s eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u0027Thank you, sir.\u0027 A grin tugged at the corner of Foaly\u0027s mouth. \u0027You\u0027re welcome. No need to get a swelled head.\u0027 Cudgeon\u0027s hand flew to his misshapen forehead. Still a touch of the old vanity left. \u0027Oops. Sore subject. Sorry about that.\u0027 There was a spark in the corner of Cudgeon\u0027s eye. A spark that should have warned Foaly. But he was distracted by a beep from the computer. \u0027List complete.\u0027 \u0027Excuse me for a moment, Commander. Important business. Computer stuff, you wouldn\u0027t understand it.\u0027 Foaly turned to the plasma screen. The lieutenant would just have to wait for his signature. It was probably just an order for shuttle parts anyway. The penny dropped. A big penny with a clang louder than a dwarf\u0027s underpants hitting a wall. Shuttle parts. An inside job. Someone with a grudge to settle. A line of sweat filled each groove on Foaly\u0027s forehead. It was so obvious. He looked at the plasma screen for confirmation of what he already knew. There were only two names. The first, Bom Arbles, could be eliminated immediately. The Retrieval officer had been killed in a core-diving accident. The second name pulsed gently. Lieutenant Briar Cudgeon. Demoted to recycling crew around the time Holly retired that starboard booster. It all made sense. Foaly knew that if he didn\u0027t acknowledge the message in ten seconds, the computer would read the name aloud. He casually punched the delete button. \u0027You know, Briar,\u0027 he croaked. \u0027All those jibes about your head problem. It\u0027s all in fun. My way of being sympathetic. Actually, I have some ointment ...\u0027 Something cold and metallic pressed against the back of the centaur\u0027s head. Foaly had seen too many rock \u0027em sock \u0027em movies not to know what it was. \u0027Save your ointment, donkey boy,\u0027 said Cudgeon\u0027s voice in his ear. T have a feeling you\u0027ll be developing some head problems of your own.\u0027 THE MAYAK CHEMICAL TRAIN, NORTHERN RUSSIA The first thing Artemis felt was a rhythmical knocking, jarring along the length of his spine. I\u0027m at the spa in Blackrock, he thought. Irina is massaging my back. Just what my system needs, especially after all that horseplay on the train . . .The train! Obviously they were still aboard the Mayak train. The jerking motion was actually the carriage jolting over the track joins. Artemis forced his eyes open, expecting gargantuan doses of stiffness and pain. But instead he realized he felt fine. More than fine. Great in fact. It must be magic. Holly must have healed his various cuts and bruises while he was unconscious. Nobody else was feeling quite so chipper. Especially Captain Short, who was still unconscious. Root was draping a large coat over his fallen officer. \u0027Oh, you\u0027re awake, are you?\u0027 he said, without so much as a glance at Artemis. \u0027I don\u0027t know how you can sleep at all after what you\u0027ve just done.\u0027 \u0027Done? But I saved you ... at least, I helped.\u0027 \u0027You helped all right, Fowl. You helped yourself to the last of Holly\u0027s magic while she was unconscious.\u0027 Artemis groaned. It must have happened when they fell. Somehow her magic had been diverted. \u0027I see what must have happened. It was an ...\" Root raised a warning finger. \u0027Don\u0027t say it. The great Artemis Fowl doesn\u0027t do anything by accident.\u0027 Artemis fought against the train\u0027s motion, climbing to his knees. \u0027It can\u0027t be anything serious. Just exhaustion, surely?\u0027 And suddenly Root\u0027s face was a centimetre from his own, his complexion rosy enough to generate heat. \u0027Nothing serious!\u0027 spluttered the commander, barely able to get the words out in his rage. \u0027Nothing serious! She lost her trigger finger! The door cut it clean off. Her career is over. And because of you, Holly barely had enough magic to stop the bleeding. She\u0027s drained of power now. Empty.\u0027 \u0027She lost a finger?\u0027 echoed Artemis numbly. \u0027Not lost exactly,\u0027 said the commander, waving the severed digit. \u0027It poked me in the eye on the way past.\u0027 His eye was already beginning to blacken. \u0027If we go back now, surely your surgeons can graft it on?\u0027 Root shook his head. \u0027If we could go back now. I have a feeling that the situation below ground is a lot different from when we left. If the goblins sent a hit team to get us, you can bet something big is going on below ground.\u0027 Artemis was shocked. Holly had saved all their lives, and this was how he had repaid her. While it was true that he was not directly to blame for the injury, it had been inflicted while trying to save his father. There was a debt to be paid here. \u0027How long?\u0027 he snapped. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027How long ago did it happen?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. A minute.\u0027 \u0027Then there\u0027s still time.\u0027 The commander sat up. \u0027Time for what?\u0027 \u0027We can still save the finger.\u0027 Root rubbed a welt of fresh scar tissue on his shoulder, a reminder of his trip along the side of the train. \u0027With what? I barely have enough power left for the mesmer.\u0027 Artemis closed his eyes. Concentrating. \u0027What about the Ritual? There must be a way.\u0027 All the People\u0027s magic came from the Earth. In order to top up their powers, they had to periodically complete the Ritual. \u0027How can we complete the Ritual here?\u0027 Artemis racked his brain. He had committed large sections of the Fairy Book to memory in preparation for the previous year\u0027s kidnapping operation. \u0027From the earth thine power flows, Given through courtesy, so thanks are owed. Pluck thou the magick seed, Where full moon, ancient oak and twisted water meet. And bury it far from where it was found, So return your gift into the ground.\u0027 Artemis scrambled across the flooring and began patting down Holly\u0027s jumpsuit. Root\u0027s heart nearly shut down then and there. \u0027In heaven\u0027s name, Mud Boy, what are you doing?\u0027 Artemis didn\u0027t even look up. \u0027Last year, Holly escaped because she had an acorn.\u0027 Through some miracle, the commander managed to restrain himself. \u0027Five seconds, Fowl. Talk fast.\u0027 \u0027An officer like Holly wouldn\u0027t forget something like that. I\u0027d be willing to bet ...\" Root sighed. \u0027It\u0027s a good idea, Mud Boy. But the acorns have to be freshly picked. If it hadn\u0027t been for the time-stop, that seed mightn\u0027t have worked. You\u0027ve got a couple of days, tops. I know Foaly and Holly put together some proposal for a sealed acorn unit, but the Council rejected it. Heresy apparently.\u0027 It was a long speech for the commander. He wasn\u0027t used to explaining himself. But a part of him was hoping. Maybe, just maybe. Holly had never been averse to bending a few rules. Artemis unzipped Captain Short\u0027s tunic. There were two tiny items on the gold chain around her neck. Her copy of the Book, the fairy bible. Artemis knew that it would combust if he tried to touch it without Holly\u0027s permission. But there was another item. A small plexiglass sphere filled with earth. \u0027That\u0027s against regulations,\u0027 said Root, not sounding too upset. Holly stirred, half-emerging from her stupor. \u0027Hey, Commander. What happened to your eye?\u0027 Artemis ignored her, cracking the tiny sphere against the carriage floor. Earth and a small acorn tumbled into his palm. \u0027Now all we need to do is bury it.\u0027 The commander slung Holly over his shoulder. Artemis tried not to look at the space where her index finger used to be. \u0027Then it\u0027s time to get off this train.\u0027 Artemis glanced at the Arctic landscape whipping past outside the carriage. Getting off the train wasn\u0027t as easy as the commander made it sound. Butler dropped nimbly through the overhead hatch, where he\u0027d been keeping an eye on the goblin hit squad. \u0027Nice to see you\u0027re so limber,\u0027 commented Artemis drily. The manservant smiled. \u0027Good to see you too, Artemis.\u0027 \u0027Well? What did you see up there?\u0027 said Root, interrupting the reunion. Butler placed a hand on his young master\u0027s shoulders. They could talk later. \u0027The goblins are gone. Funny thing. Two of them dropped low for reconnaissance, then the other one shot them in the back.\u0027 Root nodded. \u0027Power play. Goblins are their own worst enemies. But right now, we\u0027ve got to get off this train.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s another bend coming up in about half a klick,\u0027 said Butler. \u0027That\u0027s our best chance.\u0027 \u0027So, how do we disembark?\u0027 asked Artemis. Butler grinned. \u0027Disembark is a pretty gentle term for what I have in mind.\u0027 Artemis groaned. More running and jumping. OPERATIONS\u0027 BOOTH Foaly\u0027s brain was bubbling like a sea slug in a deep-fat fryer. He still had options, providing Cudgeon didn\u0027t actually shoot him. One shot and it was all over. Centaurs didn\u0027t have magic. Not a drop. They got by on brains alone. That and their ability to trample their enemies underfoot. But Foaly had a feeling that Briar wouldn\u0027t plug him just yet. Too busy gloating. \u0027Hey, Foaly,\u0027 said the lieutenant. \u0027Why don\u0027t you go for the intercom? See what happens.\u0027 Foaly could guess what would happen. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Briar. No sudden moves.\u0027 Cudgeon laughed, and he sounded genuinely happy. \u0027Briar? First name terms now, is it?You must realize how much trouble you\u0027re in.\u0027 Foaly was starting to realize just that. Beyond the tinted glass, LEP techs were beavering away trying to track down the mole, oblivious to the drama being played out not two metres away. He could see and hear them, but it was one-way surveillance. The centaur had only himself to blame. He had insisted that the Operations\u0027 booth be constructed to his own paranoid standards. A titanium cube with blast-proof windows. The entire room was wireless, not even a fibre-optic cable to connect Operations to the outside world. Totally impregnable. Unless, of course, you opened the door to throw a few insults at an old enemy. Foaly groaned. His mother had always said that his smart mouth would get him into trouble. But all was not lost. He still had a few tricks up his sleeve. A plasma floor, for instance. \u0027So what\u0027s this all about, Cudgeon?\u0027 asked the centaur, raising his hooves just off the tiles. \u0027And please don\u0027t say world domination.\u0027 Cudgeon continued to smile. This was his/moment. \u0027Not immediately. The Lower Elements will suffice for now.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 Cudgeon\u0027s eyes were tinged with madness. \u0027Why?You have the gall to ask me why? I was the the Council\u0027s golden boy! In fifty years I would have been chairman! And then along comes the Artemis Fowl Affair. In one short day all my hopes are dashed. I end up deformed and demoted! And it was all because of you, Foaly. You and Root! So the only way to get my life back on track is to discredit both of you. You will be blamed for the goblin attacks, and Julius will be dead and dishonoured. And as an added bonus, I even get Artemis Fowl. It\u0027s as close to perfect as I could have hoped.\u0027 Foaly snorted. \u0027Do you really think you can defeat the LEP with a handful of Softnose weapons?\u0027 \u0027Defeat the LEP? Why would I want to do that? I am the hero of the LEP. Or rather I will be. You will be the villain of this piece.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll see about that, baboon face,\u0027 said Foaly, activating a switch, sending an infra-red signal to a receiver in the floor. In five-tenths of a second, a secret membrane of plasma would warm up. Half a second later, a neutrino charge would spread across the plasma gel like wildfire, hopping anyone connected to the floor off at least three walls. In theory. Cudgeon giggled delightedly. \u0027Don\u0027t tell me. Your plasma tiles aren\u0027t working.\u0027 Foaly was flummoxed. Momentarily. Then he lowered his hooves gingerly and pressed another button. This one engaged a voice-activated laser. Basically, the next person to talk got plugged. The centaur held his breath. \u0027No plasma tiles,\u0027 continued Cudgeon. \u0027And no voice-activated laser. You really are slipping, Foaly. Not that I\u0027m surprised. I always knew you\u0027d be exposed for the donkey you are.\u0027 The lieutenant settled into a swivel chair, propping his feet on the computer bank. \u0027So have you figured it out yet?\u0027 Foaly thought. Who could it be? Who could beat him at his own game? Not Cudgeon, that was for sure. A techno fool if ever there was one. No, there was only one person with the ability to crack the Centaurian code and deactivate the booth\u0027s safety measures. \u0027Opal Koboi,\u0027 he breathed. Cudgeon patted Foaly\u0027s head. \u0027That\u0027s right. Opal planted a few spy cams during the upgrading work. Once you were kind enough to translate a few documents for the camera, it was a simple matter to crack your code and do a little reprogramming. And the funny thing is, the Council footed the bill. She even charged for the spy cameras. Even now, the B\u0027wa Kell is preparing to launch its attack on the cjty: LEP weapons and communications are down, and the best thing is that you, my horsy friend, will be held responsible. After all, you have locked yourself in the Operations\u0027 booth in the middle of a crisis.\u0027 \u0027Nobody will believe it!\u0027 protested Foaly. \u0027Oh yes they will, especially when you disengage the LEP security, including the DNA cannons.\u0027 \u0027Which I won\u0027t be doing anytime soon.\u0027 Cudgeon twirled a matt-black remote between his fingers. \u0027I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s not up to you any more. Opal took your little operation apart and wired the whole lot into this little beauty.\u0027 Foaly swallowed. \u0027You mean ...?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Cudgeon. \u0027Nothing works unless I press the button.\u0027 He pressed the button. And even if Foaly had had the reactions of a sprite, he would never have had time to draw up all his hooves before the plasma shock blasted him right out of his specially modified swivel chair. ARCTIC CIRCLE Butler instructed everyone to attach themselves to the Moonbelt, one per link. Floating slightly in the buffeting wind, the group manoeuvred itself to the carriage doorway like a drunken crab. It\u0027s simple physics, Artemis told himself. Reduced gravity will prevent us being dashed against the Arctic ice. In spite of all his logic, when Root launched the group into the night, Artemis couldn\u0027t hold back a single gasp. Later, when he replayed the incident in his mind\u0027s eye, Artemis would edit out the breath. The slipstream spun them beyond the railway sleepers, into a drift. Butler turned off the anti-gravity belt a second before impact, otherwise they could have bounced away, like men on the moon. Root was first to detach, scooping handfuls of snow from the surface until his fingers reached the compacted ice below. \u0027It\u0027s no use,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t break through the ice.\u0027 He heard a click behind his shoulder. \u0027Stand back,\u0027 advised Butler, taking aim with his handgun. Root obliged, shielding his eyes with a forearm. Ice slivers could blind you just as efficiently as six-inch nails. Butler put a full clip into a narrow spread, blasting a shallow hollow in the frozen surface. Instant sleet drenched the already sodden group. Root was checking the results before the smoke cleared. He brought Butler up to speed — they had seconds left before Holly\u0027s time ran out. They needed to complete the Ritual. After a certain time it mightn\u0027t be wise to attempt a graft. Even if they could. The commander jumped into the dip, sweeping aside layers of loose ice. There was a disk of brown among the white. \u0027Yes!\u0027 he crowed. \u0027Earth!\u0027 Butler lowered Holly\u0027s twitching form into the hole. She seemed like a doll in his powerful hands. Tiny and limp. Root curled Holly\u0027s fingers around the illegal acorn, thrusting her left hand deep into the shattered soil. He pulled a roll of tape from his belt, crudely securing the finger to roughly its original position. The elf and two humans gathered around and waited. \u0027It mightn\u0027t take,\u0027 muttered Root nervously. \u0027This sealed acorn thing is new. Never been tested. Foaly and his ideas. But they usually work. They usually do.\u0027 Artemis laid a hand on his shoulder. It was all he could think to do. Giving comfort was not one of his strong points. Five seconds. Ten. Nothing. Then . . . \u0027Look!\u0027 cried Artemis. \u0027A spark.\u0027 A solitary blue spark travelled lazily along the length of Holly\u0027s arm, winding along the veins. It crossed her chest, climbed her pointed chin and sank into the flesh right between the eyes. \u0027Stand-back,\u0027 advised Root. \u0027I saw a two-minute healing in Tulsa one night. Damn near destroyed an entire shuttle port. I\u0027ve never even heard of a four-minuter.\u0027 They back-pedalled to the lip of the crater and not a moment too soon. More sparks erupted from the Earth, targeting Holly\u0027s hand as the area most in need of assistance. They sank into her finger joint like plasma torpedoes, melting the plastic tape. Holly shot upright, arms swinging like a puppet. Her legs began to jerk, kicking invisible enemies. Then the vocal cords, a high-pitched keening that cracked the thinner sheets of ice. \u0027Is this normal?\u0027 whispered Artemis, as though Holly could hear. \u0027I think so,\u0027 answered the commander. \u0027The brain is running a systems check. It\u0027s not like fixing cuts and bruises, if you know what I mean.\u0027 Every pore in Holly\u0027s body started to steam, venting trace radiation. She thrashed and kicked, sinking back down into a pool of slush. Not a pretty sight. The water evaporated, shrouding the LEP captain in mist. Only her left hand was visible, fingers a desperate blur. Holly suddenly stopped moving. Her hand froze, then dropped through the mist. The Arctic night rushed in to reclaim the silence. They inched closer, leaning into the fog. Artemis wanted to see, but he was afraid to look. Butler took a breath, batting aside sheets of mist. All was quiet below. Holly\u0027s frame lay still as the grave. Artemis peered at the shape in the hole. \u0027I think she\u0027s awake ... \u0027 He was cut short by Holly\u0027s sudden return to consciousness. She bolted upright, icicles coating her eyelashes and auburn hair. Her chest ballooned as she swallowed huge gulps of air. Artemis grabbed her shoulders, for once abandoning his shell of icy composure. \u0027Holly. Holly, speak to me. Your finger. Is it OK?\u0027 Holly wiggled her fingers, then curled them into a fist. \u0027I think so,\u0027 she said, and whacked Artemis right between the eyes. The surprised boy landed in a snowdrift for the fourth time that day. Holly winked at an amazed Butler. \u0027Now, we\u0027re even,\u0027 she said. Commander Root didn\u0027t have many treasured memories. But in future days, when things were at their grimmest, he would conjure up this moment and have a quiet chuckle. OPERATIONS\u0027 BOOTH Foaly woke up sore, which was unusual for him. He couldn\u0027t even remember the last time he\u0027d experienced actual pain. His feelings had been hurt a few times by Julius\u0027s barbed comments, but actual physical discomfort was not something he cared to endure when he could avoid it. The centaur was lying on the Operations\u0027 Security-booth floor, tangled in the remains of his office chair. \u0027Cudgeon,\u0027 he growled, and what followed was about two minutes\u0027 worth of unprintable obscenity. When he had finally vented his anger, the centaur\u0027s brain kicked in, and he hauled himself up from the plasma tiles. His rump was singed. He was going to have a couple of bald spots on his hind quarters. Very unattractive in a centaur. It was the first thing a prospective mate looked for in a nightclub. Not that Foaly had ever been much of a dancer. Four left hooves. The booth was sealed. Tighter than a gnome\u0027s wallet, as the saying went. Foaly typed in his exit code. \u0027Foaly. Doors.\u0027 The computer remained silent. He tried verbal. \u0027Foaly. One two one override. Doors.\u0027 Not a peep. He was trapped. A prisoner of his own security devices. Even the windows were set to blackout, blocking his view of the Operations\u0027 room. Completely locked out, and locked in. Nothing worked. Well, that wasn\u0027t completely accurate. Everything worked, but his precious computers wouldn\u0027t respond to his touch. And Foaly was only too well aware that there was no way out of the booth without access to the mainframe. Foaly plucked the tin foil hat from his head, crunching it into a ball. \u0027A lot of good you did me!\u0027 he said, tossing it into the waste recycler. The recycler would analyse the chemical make-up of the item, then divert it to the appropriate tank. A plasma monitor crackled into life on the wall. Opal Koboi\u0027s magnified face appeared, plastered with the widest grin the centaur had ever seen. \u0027Hello, Foaly. Long time no see.\u0027 Foaly returned the grin, but his wasn\u0027t quite as wide. \u0027Opal. How nice to see you. How are the folks?\u0027 Everyone knew how Opal had bankrupted her father. It was a legend in the corporate world. \u0027Very well, thanks. Cumulus House is a lovely asylum.\u0027 Foaly decided he would try sincerity. It was a tool he didn\u0027t use very often. But he would give it a go. \u0027Opal. Think about what you\u0027re doing. Cudgeon is insane, for pity\u0027s sake. Once he has what he wants, he will dispose of you in a heartbeat!\u0027 The pixie shook a perfectly manicured finger. \u0027No, Foaly, you\u0027re wrong. Briar needs me. He really does. He\u0027d be nothing without me and my gold.\u0027 The centaur looked deep into Opal\u0027s eyes. The pixie actually believed what she was saying. How could someone so brilliant be so deluded? \u0027I know what this is all about, Opal.\u0027 \u0027Oh, you do?\u0027 \u0027Yes. You\u0027re still sore because I won the science medal back in university.\u0027 For a second, Koboi\u0027s composure slipped, and her features didn\u0027t seem quite so perfect. \u0027That medal was mine, you stupid centaur. My wing design was far superior to your ridiculous iris-cam. You won because you were a male. And that\u0027s the only reason.\u0027 Foaly grinned, satisfied. Even with the odds so hugely against him, he hadn\u0027t lost the ability to be the most annoying creature under the world when he wanted to be. \u0027So what do you want, Opal? Or did you just call to chat about our schooldays?\u0027 Opal took a long drink from a crystal glass. \u0027I just called, Foaly, to let you know I\u0027m watching, so don\u0027t try anything. I also wanted to show you something from the security cameras downtown. This is live footage by the way, and Briar is with the Council right now, blaming you for it. Happy viewing.\u0027 Opal\u0027s face disappeared to be replaced by a high-angle view of downtown Haven. A tourist district, outside Spud\u0027s Spud Emporium. Generally, this area would be thronged with Atlantean couples taking photos of each other in front of the fountain. But not today, because today the square was a battleground. The B\u0027wa Kell was waging open war with the LEP and, by the looks of things, it was a one-sided battle. The goblins were firing their Softnose weapons, but the police were not shooting back.
