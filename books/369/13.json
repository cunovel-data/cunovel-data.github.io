{"id":10742,"no":13,"title":"An Epilogue or Two","content":"TARA\\n\\n \\n\\n Artemis was heading back to St Bartleby\u0027s. This was where he had to be when the Helsinki medical services identified his father from the suitably weathered passport Foaly had run up for him.\\n\\n Holly had done her best for the injured man, healing his chest wound and even restoring sight to his blinded eye. But it was too late to reattach the leg, which they didn\u0027t have in any case. No, Artemis Senior needed prolonged medical attention, and it had to begin somewhere that could be rationally explained. So Holly had flown south-west to Helsinki, depositing the unconscious man at the doors of the University Hospital. One porter had spotted the flying patient, but he had been successfully mind-wiped.\\n\\n When Artemis Senior regained consciousness the past two years would be a blur, and his last memory would be a happy one: bidding his family farewell at Dublin harbour. Thanks again to Foaly and his mind-wiping technology.\\n\\n \u0027Why don\u0027t I just move in with you?\u0027 the centaur had quipped when they returned to Police Plaza. \u0027Do your ironing while I\u0027m at it.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis smiled. He had been doing that a lot lately. Even the parting with Holly had gone better than he could have expected, considering she\u0027d seen him shoot his own father. Artemis shuddered. He anticipated many sleepless nights over that particular strategy.\\n\\n The captain escorted them to Tara, slipping them out through a holographic hedge. There was even a holographic cow chewing the virtual leaves to throw humans off the fairy scent.\\n\\n Artemis was back in his school uniform, which had been miraculously restored by the People\u0027s technology. He sniffed his lapel.\\n\\n \u0027This blazer smells unusual,\u0027 he commented. \u0027Not unpleasant, but unusual.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s completely clean,\u0027 said Holly, smiling. \u0027Foaly had to put it through three cycles in the machine to purge...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To purge the Mud People from it,\u0027 completed Artemis.\\n\\n \u0027Exactly.\u0027\\n\\n There was a full moon overhead, bright and pocked like a golf ball. Holly could feel its magic singing to her.\\n\\n \u0027Foaly said, in the light of the help you\u0027ve given us, he\u0027s pulling the surveillance on Fowl Manor.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s good to know,\u0027 said Artemis.\\n\\n \u0027Is it the right decision?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis considered it. \u0027Yes. The People are safe from me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Because a large section of the Council wanted you mind-wiped. And with a chunk of memory this big, your IQ could take a bit of a dip.\u0027\\n\\n Butler extended a hand. \u0027Well, Captain. I don\u0027t suppose I\u0027ll see you again.\u0027\\n\\n Holly shook it. \u0027If you do, it\u0027ll be too late.\u0027 Captain Short turned towards the fairy fort. \u0027I had better go. It will be light soon. I don\u0027t want to be caught unshielded on a spy satellite. The last thing I need is my photo all over the Internet. Not when I\u0027ve just been reinstated at Recon.\u0027\\n\\n Butler elbowed his employer gently.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Holly ... Eh, Captain Short.\u0027 Eh? Artemis couldn\u0027t believe he\u0027d actually said eh. It wasn\u0027t even a word.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Mud B ... Yes, Artemis?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis looked Holly in the eye, just as Butler had instructed. This \u0027being civil\u0027 business was more difficult than one would think. \u0027I would like to ... I mean.What I mean is ...\"\\n\\n Another elbow from Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Thank you. I owe you everything. Because of you I have my parents. And the way you flew that craft was nothing short of spectacular. And on the train ... Well, I could never have done what you ...\u0027\\n\\n A third elbow. This time to stop the babbling.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry. Well, you get the idea.\u0027\\n\\n Holly\u0027s elfin features wore a strange expression. Somewhere between embarrassment and — could it possibly be? — delight. She recovered quickly.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe I owe you something too, human,\u0027 she said, drawing her pistol. Butler almost reacted, but decided to give Holly the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\n Captain Short plucked a gold coin from her belt, flicking it twenty metres into the moonlit sky. With one fluid movement, she brought her weapon up and loosed a single blast. The coin rose another twenty metres, then spun earthwards. Artemis somehow managed to snatch it from the air. The first cool moment of his young life.\\n\\n \u0027Nice shot,\u0027 he said. The previously solid disc now had a tiny hole in the centre.\\n\\n Holly held out her hand, revealing the still-raw scar on her finger. \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for you, I would have missed altogether. No mech-digit can replicate that kind of accuracy. So, thank you too, I suppose.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis held out the coin.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027You keep it, to remind you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To remind me?\u0027\\n\\n Holly stared at him frankly. \u0027To remind you that deep beneath the layers of deviousness, there is a spark of decency. Perhaps you could blow on that spark occasionally.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis closed his fingers around the coin. It was warm against his palm. \u0027Yes, perhaps.\u0027\\n\\n A small two-seater plane buzzed overhead. Artemis glanced skywards, and when he looked back Holly was gone. A slight heat haze hovered above the grass.\\n\\n \u0027Goodbye, Holly,\u0027 he said softly.\\n\\n The Bentley started on the first turn of the key. In less than an hour they arrived at St Bartleby\u0027s main gate.\\n\\n \u0027Make sure your phone\u0027s switched on,\u0027 Butler said, holding the door. \u0027The Helsinki officials should be getting the results of their trace from Interpol soon. Your father\u0027s file has been reactivated in their mainframe thanks, once again, to Foaly.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis nodded, checking his phone was switched on. \u0027Try to locate Mother and Juliet before the news comes through. I don\u0027t want to be hunting through every spa in the south of France looking for them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Artemis.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And check my accounts are well hidden. No need for Father to know exactly what I\u0027ve been up to for the past two years.\u0027\\n\\n Butler smiled. \u0027Yes, Artemis.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis took a few steps towards the school gates, then turned. \u0027And, Butler, one more thing. In the Arctic ...\"\\n\\n Artemis couldn\u0027t ask, but his bodyguard knew the answer anyway.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Artemis,\u0027 he said gently. \u0027You did the right thing. It was the only way.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis nodded, standing by the gates until the Bentley had disappeared down the avenue. From this moment on, life would be different. With two parents in the manor, his schemes would have to be much more carefully planned. Yes, he owed it to the People to leave them alone for a while, but Mulch Diggums ... that was a different matter. So many secure facilities, so little time.\\n\\n \\n\\n COUNSELLOR\u0027S OFFICE, ST BARTLEBY\u0027S SCHOOL FOR YOUNG GENTLEMEN\\n\\n \\n\\n Not only was Doctor Po still employed at St Bartleby\u0027s, but he seemed fortified by his break from Artemis. His other patients were relatively straightforward cases of anger management, exam stress and chronic shyness. And that was just the teachers.\\n\\n Artemis settled on to the couch, taking care not to accidentally press the power button on his mobile.\\n\\n Doctor Po nodded at his computer. \u0027Principal Guiney forwarded me your e-mail. Charming.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry about that,\u0027 muttered Artemis, surprised to find that he actually was sorry. Upsetting other people didn\u0027t usually upset him. \u0027I was in denial. So, I projected my anxieties on to you.\u0027\\n\\n Po half chuckled. \u0027Yes, very good. Just what it says in the book.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Artemis. And he did know. Doctor F. Roy Dean Schlippe had contributed a chapter to that particular book.\\n\\n Doctor Po laid down his pen, something he had never done before.\\n\\n \u0027You know, we still haven\u0027t resolved that last issue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which issue is that, Doctor?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The one we touched on at our last session. About respect?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah, that issue.\u0027\\n\\n Po steepled his fingers. \u0027I want you to pretend I\u0027m as smart as you are, and give me an honest answer.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis thought of his father lying in a Helsinki hospital, of Captain Holly Short risking her life to help him and, of course, Butler, without whom he would never have made it out of Koboi Laboratories. He looked up, catching Doctor Po smiling at him.\\n\\n \u0027Well, young man, have you found anyone worthy of your respect?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis smiled back. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said. \u0027I believe I have.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n THE END\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/257.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
