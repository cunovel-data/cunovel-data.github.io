He could have been in any police interview room in the world. Same uncomfortable furniture, same old routine. Root jumped right in. \u0027OK, Fowl, start talking.\u0027 Artemis took a moment to get his bearings. Holly and Root were facing him across a low plastic-topped table. A high-watt bulb shone directly into his face.\n \u0027Really, Commander. Is this it? I expected more.\u0027 \u0027Oh there\u0027s more. Just not for criminals like you.\u0027 Artemis noted that his hands were shackled to the chair.\n \u0027You\u0027re not still upset about last year, are you? After all, I won. That is supposed to be that, according to your own Book.\u0027\n Root leaned forward until the tip of his cigar was centimetres from Artemis\u0027s nose. \u0027This is an entirely different case, Mud Boy. So don\u0027t give me the innocent act.\u0027\n Artemis was unperturbed. \u0027Which one are you? Good Cop or Bad Cop?\u0027\n Root laughed heartily, the tip of his cigar drawing patterns in the air. \u0027Good Cop, Bad Cop! Hate to tell you this, Dorothy, but you ain\u0027t in Kansas any more.\u0027 The commander loved quoting The Wizard of Oz. Three of his cousins were in the movie.\n A figure emerged from the shadows. It had a tail, four legs, two arms and was holding what looked like a pair of common kitchen plungers.\n \u0027OK, Mud Boy,\u0027 said the figure. \u0027Just relax and this might not hurt too much.\u0027\n Foaly attached the suction cups to Artemis\u0027s eyes and the boy immediately fell unconscious.\n \u0027The sedative is in the rubber seals,\u0027 explained the centaur. \u0027Gets in through the pores. They never see it coming. Tell me I\u0027m not the cleverest individual in the universe.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Root innocently. \u0027That pixie Koboi is one pretty sharp female.\u0027\n Foaly stamped a hoof angrily. \u0027Koboi? Koboi? Those wings of hers are ridiculous. If you ask me, we\u0027re using far too much Koboi technology these days. It\u0027s not good to let one company have all the LEP\u0027s business.\u0027\n \u0027Unless it\u0027s yours, of course.\u0027\n ‘I’m serious, Julius. I know Opal Koboi from my days at university. She\u0027s not stable. There are Koboi chips in all the new Neutrinos. If those labs go under, all we\u0027d have left are the DNA cannons in Police Plaza and a few cases of electric stun guns.\u0027\n Root snorted. \u0027Koboi just upgraded every gun and vehicle in the force. Three times the power, half the heat emission. Better than the last statistics from your lab, Foaly.\u0027\n Foaly threaded a set of fibre-optic cables back to the computer.\n \u0027Yes, well, maybe if the Council would give me a decent budget ...\"\n \u0027Quit your moaning, Foaly. I saw the budget for this machine. It better do more than unblock the drains.\u0027\n Foaly flicked his tail, highly offended.\n \u0027This is a Retimager, I\u0027m considering going private with this baby.\u0027\n \u0027And it does what exactly?\u0027\n Foaly activated a plasma screen on the holding-cell wall.\n \u0027You see these dark circles? These are the human\u0027s retinas. Every image leaves a tiny etching, like a photo negative. We can feed whatever pictures we want into the computer and search for matches.\u0027\n Root didn\u0027t exactly fall to his knees in awe. \u0027Isn\u0027t that handy.\u0027\n \u0027Well, yes, it is actually. Observe.\u0027\n Foaly called up an image of a goblin, cross-referencing it with the Retimager\u0027s database.\n \u0027For every matching point we get a hit. About two hundred hits is normal. General shape of the head, features and so on. Anything significantly above that and he\u0027s seen that goblin before.\u0027\n One eighty-six flashed up on the screen.\n \u0027Negative on the goblin. Let\u0027s try a Softnose.\u0027\n Again, the count was under two hundred.\n \u0027Another negative. Sorry, Captain, but Master Fowl here is innocent. He\u0027s never even seen a goblin, much less traded with the B\u0027wa Kell.\u0027\n \u0027They could have mind-wiped him.\u0027\n Foaly removed the seals from Artemis\u0027s eyes. \u0027That\u0027s the beauty of this baby. Mind-wipes don\u0027t work. The Retimager operates on actual physical evidence. You\u0027d have to scrub the retinas.\u0027\n \u0027Anything on the human\u0027s computer?\u0027\n \u0027Plenty,\u0027 replied Foaly. \u0027But nothing incriminating. Not a single mention of goblins or batteries.\u0027\n Root scratched his square jaw. \u0027What about the big one? He could have been the go-between.\u0027\n \u0027Did him already with the Retimager. Nothing. Face it, the LEP have pulled in the wrong Mud Men. Wipe \u0027em and send \u0027em home.\u0027\n Holly nodded. The commander didn\u0027t.\n \u0027Wait a minute. I\u0027m thinking.\u0027\n \u0027About what?\u0027 asked Holly. \u0027The sooner we get Artemis Fowl\u0027s nose out of our business, the better.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe not. Since they\u0027re already here ...\"\n Holly\u0027s jaw dropped. \u0027Commander. You don\u0027t know Fowl like I do. Give him half a chance and he\u0027ll be a bigger problem than the goblins.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe he could help us with our Mud Man problem.\u0027\n \u0027I have to object, Commander.These humans are not to be trusted.\u0027\n Root\u0027s face would have glowed in the dark.\n \u0027Do you think I like this, Captain? Do you think I relish the idea of crawling to this Mud Boy? I do not. I would rather swallow live stink worms than ask Artemis Fowl for help. But someone is powering the B\u0027wa Kell\u0027s arms, and I need to find out who. So get with the programme, Holly. There\u0027s more at stake here than your little vendetta.\u0027\n Holly bit her tongue. She couldn\u0027t oppose the commander, not after all he\u0027d done for her, but asking Artemis Fowl for help was the wrong course of action whatever the situation. She didn\u0027t doubt for a minute that the human would have a solution to their problem, but at what cost?\n Root drew a deep breath. \u0027OK, Foaly, bring him round. And fit him with a translator. Speaking Mud Man gives me a headache.\u0027\n \n \n *\n \n \n Artemis massaged the puffy skin beneath his eyes.\n \u0027Sedative in the seals?\u0027 he said, glancing at Foaly. \u0027Micro-needles?\u0027\n The centaur was impressed. \u0027You\u0027re pretty sharp for a Mud Boy.\u0027\n Artemis touched the crescent-shaped nodule fixed above his ear.\n \u0027Translator?\u0027\n Foaly nodded at the commander. \u0027Speaking in tongues gives some people a headache.\u0027\n Artemis straightened his school tie. \u0027I see. Now, how can I be of service?\u0027\n \u0027What makes you think we need help from you, human?\u0027 growled Root around the butt of his cigar.\n The boy smirked. \u0027I have a feeling, Commander, that if you did not need something from me, I would be regaining consciousness in my own bed, with absolutely no memory of our encounter.\u0027\n Foaly hid his grin behind a hairy hand.\n \u0027You\u0027re lucky you\u0027re not waking up in a cell,\u0027 said Holly.\n \u0027Still bitter, Captain Short? Can\u0027t we wipe the slate clean?\u0027\n Holly\u0027s glare was all the answer he needed.\n Artemis sighed. \u0027Very well. I shall guess. There are humans trading with the Lower Elements. And you need Butler to track these merchants down. Close enough?\u0027\n The fairies were silent for a moment. Hearing it from Fowl suddenly brought the reality home to them.\n \u0027Close enough,\u0027 admitted Root. \u0027OK, Foaly, bring Mud Boy up to speed.\u0027\n The consultant loaded a file from the LEP central server. A series of Network News clips flashed up on the plasma screen. The reporter was a middle-aged elf with a quiff the size of a Honolulu roller.\n \u0027Downtown Haven,\u0027 crooned the reporter. \u0027Another contraband seizure by the LEP. Hollywood laser disks with an estimated street value of five hundred gold grams. The B\u0027wa Kell goblin triad is suspected.\u0027\n \u0027It gets worse,\u0027 said Root grimly.\n Artemis smiled. \u0027There\u0027s worse?\u0027\n The reporter appeared again. This time flames billowed from the windows of a warehouse behind him. His quiff looked a bit crispy.\n \u0027Tonight the B\u0027wa Kell has staked its claim to the East Bank by torching a warehouse used by Koboi Laboratories. Apparently the pixie with the golden touch refused to pay the triad\u0027s protection fee.\u0027\n The flames were replaced by another news bite, this time featuring an angry mob.\n \u0027Controversy today outside Police Plaza as the public protest at the LEP\u0027s failure to deal with the goblin problem. Many ancient houses have been put out of business by the B\u0027wa Kell\u0027s racketeering. Most heavily targeted has been Koboi Laboratories, which has suffered six counts of sabotage in the past month alone.\u0027\n Foaly froze the image. The public did not look happy.\n \u0027The thing you have to understand, Fowl, is that goblins are dumb. I\u0027m not insulting them. It\u0027s scientifically proven. Brains no bigger than rats.\u0027\n Artemis nodded. \u0027So who\u0027s organizing them?\u0027\n Root ground out his cigar. \u0027We don\u0027t know. But it\u0027s getting worse. The B\u0027wa Kell has graduated from petty crime to an all-out war on the police. Last night we intercepted a delivery of batteries from the surface. These batteries are being used to power outlawed Softnose laser weapons.\u0027\n \u0027And Captain Short thought that I might be the Mud Man on the other end of the deal.\u0027\n \u0027Can you blame me?\u0027muttered Holly.\n Artemis ignored the comment. \u0027How do you know the goblins aren\u0027t just ripping off wholesalers? After all, batteries are rarely under guard.\u0027\n Foaly chuckled. \u0027No, I don\u0027t think you understand just how stupid goblins are. Let me give you an example. One of the B\u0027wa Kell generals, and this is their top fairy, was caught trying to pass off forged credit slips by signing his own name. No, whoever is behind this would need a human contact to make sure the deals weren\u0027t fouled up.\u0027\n \u0027So you\u0027d like me to find out who this human contact is,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027And more importantly, how much he knows.\u0027\n As he spoke, Artemis\u0027s mind was racing. He could work this entire situation to his advantage. The People\u0027s powers would be valuable aces to hold in a negotiation with mobsters. The seeds of a plan began to sprout in his brain.\n Root nodded reluctantly. \u0027That\u0027s it. I can\u0027t risk putting LEPrecon agents above ground. Who knows what technology the goblins have traded. I could be walking my men into a trap. As humans, you could both blend in.\u0027\n \u0027Butler blend in?\u0027 said Artemis, smiling. \u0027I doubt it.\u0027\n \u0027At least he doesn\u0027t have four legs and a tail,\u0027 observed Foaly.\n \u0027Point taken. And there is no doubt that if any man alive can track down your rogue trader, it\u0027s Butler. But ...\u0027\n Here we go, thought Holly. Artemis Fowl does nothing for nothing.\n \u0027But?\u0027 prompted Root.\n \u0027But if you want my help, I will require something in return.\u0027\n \u0027What exactly?\u0027 said Root warily.\n \u0027I need transport to Russia,\u0027 replied Artemis. \u0027The Arctic Circle to be precise. And I need help with a rescue attempt.\u0027\n Root frowned. \u0027Northern Russia is not good for us. We can\u0027t shield there because of the radiation.\u0027\n \u0027Those are my conditions,\u0027 said Artemis. \u0027The man I intend to rescue is my father. For all I know, it\u0027s already too late. So I really don\u0027t have time to negotiate.\u0027\n The Mud Boy sounded sincere. Even Holly\u0027s heart softened for a moment. But you never knew with Artemis Fowl — this could all be part of yet another scheme. Root made an executive decision.\n \u0027Deal,\u0027 he said, holding out his hand.\n They shook. Fairy and human. A historic moment.\n \u0027Good,\u0027 said Root. \u0027Now, Foaly, wake the big one and give that goblin shuttle a quick systems check.\u0027\n \u0027What about me?\u0027 asked Holly. \u0027Back on stakeout duty?\u0027\n If Root had not been a commander, he probably would have cackled. \u0027Oh no, Captain. You\u0027re the best shuttle pilot we have. You\u0027re going to Paris.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/248.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
