{"id":10741,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 13 Into the Breach","content":"BELOW KOBOI LABORATORIES\\n\\n \\n\\n AN LEP shuttle is shaped like a teardrop, bottom heavy with thrusters and a nose that could cut through steel. Of course our heroes weren\u0027t in an LEP shuttle, they were in the ambassador\u0027s luxury cruiser. Comfort was definitely favoured over speed. It had a nose like a gnome\u0027s behind. Bulky and expensive-looking, with a grill you could use to barbecue buffalo.\\n\\n \u0027So, you\u0027re saying this fissure is going to open up for a couple of minutes and I have to fly through. And that\u0027s the entire plan?\u0027 said Holly.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s the best we\u0027ve got,\u0027 said Root glumly. \u0027Well, at least we\u0027ll be in padded seats when we get squashed. This thing handles like a three-legged rhinoceros.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How was I to know?\u0027 grumbled Root. \u0027This was supposed to be a routine run. This shuttle has an excellent stereo.\u0027\\n\\n Butler raised his hand. \u0027Listen. What\u0027s that sound?\u0027\\n\\n They listened. The noise came from below them, like a giant clearing its throat.\\n\\n Holly consulted the keel cams.\\n\\n \u0027Flare,\u0027 she announced. \u0027Big sucker. It\u0027ll be roasting our tail feathers any minute.\u0027\\n\\n The rock face before them cracked and groaned in constant expansion and retraction. Fissures heaved like grinning mouths lined with black teeth.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s it. Let\u0027s go,\u0027 urged Mulch. \u0027That fissure is going to seal up faster than a stink worm\u0027s —\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not enough room yet,\u0027 snapped Holly. \u0027This is a shuttle, not one fat dwarf riding stolen wings.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was too scared to be insulted. \u0027Just move it. It\u0027ll widen as we go.\u0027\\n\\n Generally Holly would have waited for Root to give the green light. But this was her area. No one was going to argue with Captain Holly Short at the controls of a shuttle.\\n\\n The chasm shuddered open another metre.\\n\\n Holly gritted her teeth. \u0027Hold on to your ears,\u0027 she said, ramming the thrusters to maximum.\\n\\n The craft\u0027s occupants clutched their armrests, and more than one of them closed their eyes. But not Artemis. He couldn\u0027t. There was something morbidly fascinating about flying into an uncharted tunnel at a reckless speed, with only a kleptomaniac dwarf\u0027s word for what lay at the other end.\\n\\n Holly concentrated on her instruments. Hull cameras and sensors fed information to various screens and speakers. Sonar was going crazy, beeping so fast it was almost a continuous whine. Fixed halogen headlights fed frightening images to the monitors, and laser radar drew a green 3D line picture on a dark screen. Then, of course, there was the quartz windscreen. But with sheets of rock dust and larger debris, the naked eye was next to useless.\\n\\n \u0027Temperature increasing,\u0027 she muttered, glancing at the rear-view monitor. An orange magma column blasted past the fissure mouth, spilling over into the tunnel.\\n\\n They were in a desperate race. The fissure was closing behind them and expanding before the craft\u0027s prow. The noise was terrific. Thunder in a bubble.\\n\\n Mulch covered his ears. \u0027Next time, I\u0027ll take Howler\u0027s Peak.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Quiet, convict,\u0027 growled Root. \u0027This was all your idea.\u0027\\n\\n Their arguing was interrupted by a tremendous grating, sending sparks dancing across the windscreen.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 apologized Captain Short. \u0027There goes our communications array.\u0027\\n\\n She flipped the craft sideways, scraping between two shifting plates. The magma\u0027s heat coated the rock face, dragging the plates together. A jagged edge clipped the shuttle\u0027s rear as the plates crashed behind them. A giant\u0027s handclap. Butler held his Sig Sauer. It was a comfort thing.\\n\\n Then they were through, spiralling into a cavern towards three enormous titanium rods.\\n\\n \u0027There,\u0027 gasped Mulch. \u0027The foundation rods.\u0027\\n\\n Holly rolled her eyes. \u0027You don\u0027t say,\u0027 she groaned, firing the docking clamps.\\n\\n Mulch had drawn another diagram. This one looked like a bendy snake.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re being led by an idiot with a crayon,\u0027 said Root, with deceptive calmness.\\n\\n \u0027I got you this far, didn\u0027t I, Julius?\u0027 said Mulch, pouting.\\n\\n Holly was finishing the last bottle of mineral water. A good third of it went over her head.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you dare start sulking, dwarf,\u0027 she said. \u0027As far as I can see, we\u0027re stuck in the centre of the Earth, with no way out and no communications.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch backed up a step. \u0027I can see you\u0027re a bit tense after the flight. Let\u0027s all calm down now, shall we?\u0027\\n\\n Nobody looked very calm. Even Artemis seemed slightly shaken by the ordeal. Butler still hadn\u0027t let go of the Sig Sauer.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s the hard bit over. We\u0027re in the foundations now. The only way is up.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh really, convict?\u0027 said Root. \u0027And how do you suggest we go up exactly?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch plucked a carrot from the cooler, waving it at his diagram. \u0027This here is ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A snake?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Julius. It\u0027s one of the foundation rods.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The solid titanium foundation rods, sunk in impregnable bedrock?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The very ones. Except one isn\u0027t exactly solid.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis nodded. \u0027I thought so. You cut corners on this work, didn\u0027t you, Mulch?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was unrepentant. \u0027You know what building regulations are like. Solid titanium pillars? Do you have any idea how expensive that is? Threw our estimate right off. So me \u0027n\u0027 cousin Nord decided to forget the titanium packing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you had to fill that column with something,\u0027 interrupted the commander. \u0027Koboi would have run scans.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch nodded guiltily.\\n\\n \u0027We hooked up the sewage pipes to it for a couple of days. The sonographs came up clean.\u0027\\n\\n Holly felt her throat clench. \u0027Sewage. You mean ...\"\\n\\n \u0027No. Not any more. That was a hundred years ago, it\u0027s just clay now. Very good clay as it happens.\u0027\\n\\n Root\u0027s face could have boiled a large cauldron of water.\\n\\n \u0027You expect us to climb through twenty metres of ... manure?\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf shrugged. \u0027Hey, do I care? Stay here forever if you want, I\u0027m going up the pipe.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis did not like this sudden turn of events. Running, jumping, injury. OK. But sewage? \u0027This is your plan?\u0027 he managed to mutter.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter, Mud Boy,\u0027 smirked Mulch. \u0027Afraid of getting your hands dirty?\u0027\\n\\n It was only a figure of speech, Artemis knew. But true nevertheless. He glanced at his slender fingers. Yesterday morning they were pianist\u0027s fingers with manicured nails. Today they could have belonged to a builder.\\n\\n Holly clapped Artemis on the shoulder. \u0027OK,\u0027 she declared. \u0027Let\u0027s do it. As soon as we save the Lower Elements, we can get back to rescuing your father.\u0027\\n\\n Holly noticed a change in Artemis\u0027s face. Almost as if his features weren\u0027t sure how to arrange themselves. She paused, realizing what she had said. For her, the remark had been a casual encouragement, the kind of thing an officer said every day. But it seemed as though Artemis was not accustomed to being a member of a team.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t think I\u0027m getting chummy or anything. It\u0027s just that when I give my word, I stick to it.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis decided not to respond. He\u0027d already been punched once today.\\n\\n \\n\\n *\\n\\n \\n\\n They descended from the shuttle on a folding stairway.\\n\\n Artemis stepped on to the surface, picking his way through the jagged stones and construction debris abandoned by Mulch and his cousin a century earlier. The cavern was lit by the star-like twinkle of rock phosphorescence.\\n\\n \u0027This place is a geological marvel,\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027The pressure at this depth should be crushing us, but it isn\u0027t.\u0027 He knelt to examine a fungus sprouting from a rusting paint tin. \u0027There\u0027s even life.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch wrenched the remains of a hammer from between two rocks.\\n\\n \u0027So that\u0027s where this got to. We overdid it a bit on the explosives, blasting the shaft for these columns. Some of our waste must have ... fallen down here.\u0027\\n\\n Holly was appalled. Pollution is an abomination to the People.\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve broken so many laws here, Mulch, I don\u0027t even have the fingers to count them. When you get that two-day head start, you better move fast, because I\u0027m going to be the one chasing you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Here we are,\u0027 said Mulch, ignoring the threat. When you\u0027d heard as many as he had, they just rolled right off.\\n\\n There was a hole bored into one of the columns. Mulch rubbed the edges fondly.\\n\\n \u0027Diamond laser cutter. Little nuclear battery.That baby could cut through anything.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember that cutter too,\u0027 said Root. \u0027You nearly decapitated me with it once.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch sighed. \u0027Happy days, eh, Julius?\u0027\\n\\n Root\u0027s reply was a swift kick in the behind. \u0027Less talk, more eating dirt, convict.\u0027\\n\\n Holly placed her hand into the hole. \u0027Air currents. The pressure field from the city must have equalized this cave over the years. That\u0027s why we\u0027re not flat as manta rays right now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Butler and Root simultaneously. Another lie for the list.\\n\\n Mulch undid his bum-flap.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll tunnel up to the top and wait for you there. Clear as much of the debris as you can. I\u0027ll spread the recycled mud around, to avoid closing up the shaft.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis groaned. The idea of crawling through Mulch\u0027s recyclings was almost intolerable. Only the thought of his father kept him going.\\n\\n Mulch stepped into the shaft. \u0027Stand back,\u0027 he warned, unhinging his jaw.\\n\\n Butler moved quickly — he was not about to get nailed by dwarf gas again.\\n\\n Mulch disappeared up to his waist in the titanium column. In moments he had disappeared entirely. The pipe began to shudder with strange, unappetizing sounds. Chunks of clay clattered against the metal walls. A constant stream of condensed air and debris spiralled from the hole.\\n\\n \u0027Amazing,\u0027 breathed Artemis. \u0027What I could do with ten like him. Fort Knox would be a pushover.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t even think about it,\u0027 warned Root. He turned to Butler. \u0027What have we got?\u0027\\n\\n The manservant drew his pistol. \u0027One Sig Sauer handgun with twelve rounds in the magazine. That\u0027s it. I\u0027ll take the gun, as I\u0027m the only one who can lift it. You two pick up whatever you can on the run.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what about me?\u0027 asked Artemis, even though he knew what was coming.\\n\\n Butler looked his master straight in the eye. \u0027I want you to stay here. This is a military operation. All you can do is get yourself killed.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My job is to protect you, Artemis, and this is quite possibly the safest spot on the planet.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis didn\u0027t argue. In truth, these facts had already occurred to him. Sometimes being a genius was a burden.\\n\\n \u0027Very well, Butler. I shall remain here. Unless ...\u0027\\n\\n Butler\u0027s eyes narrowed. \u0027Unless what?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis gave a dangerous smile. \u0027Unless I have an idea.\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n POLICE PLAZA\\n\\n \\n\\n In Police Plaza the situation was desperate. Captain Kelp had pulled the remaining forces into a circle behind overturned workstations. The goblins were taking pot shots through the doorway, and none of the warlocks had a drop of magic left in them. Anyone who got injured from now on, stayed injured.\\n\\n The Council was huddled behind a wall of troops. All except Wing Commander Vinyaya, who had demanded to be given one of the electric rifles. She hadn\u0027t missed yet.\\n\\n The techs were crouched behind their desks, trying every code combination in the book to gain access to the Operations\u0027 booth. Trouble didn\u0027t hold out much hope on that front. If Foaly locked a door then it stayed locked.\\n\\n Meanwhile, inside the booth, all the centaur could do was pound his fists in frustration. It was a sign of Cudgeon\u0027s cruelty that he allowed Foaly to view the battle beyond the blast windows.\\n\\n It seemed hopeless. Even if Julius and Holly had received his message, it was too late now to do anything. Foaly\u0027s lips and throat were dry. Everything had deserted him. His computer, his intellect, his glib sarcasm. Everything.\\n\\n \\n\\n BELOW KOBOI LABORATORIES\\n\\n \\n\\n Something wet slapped Butler in the head.\\n\\n \u0027What was that?\u0027 he hissed at Holly, who was bringing up the rear.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t ask,\u0027 croaked Captain Short. Even through her helmet filters the smell was foul.\\n\\n The contents of the column had had a century to ferment, and smelled as toxic as the day it went in. Probably worse. At least, thought the bodyguard, I don\u0027t have to eat this stuff.\\n\\n Root was on point, his helmet lights cutting swathes through the darkness. The pillar was on a forty-degree angle, with regular grooves that were intended to anchor the titanium block filling.\\n\\n Mulch had done a sterling job of breaking down the pipe\u0027s contents. But the recycling had to go somewhere. Mulch, in fairness to him, chewed every mouthful thoroughly to avoid too many lumps.\\n\\n The raiding party struggled on grimly, trying not to think about what they were actually doing. By the time they caught up with the dwarf, he was clinging to a ridge, face constricted in pain.\\n\\n \u0027What is it, Mulch?\u0027 asked Root, concern accidentally slipping into his tones.\\n\\n \u0027Geddup,\u0027 Mulch groaned. \u0027Geddup rih now.\u0027\\n\\n Root\u0027s eyes widened with something approaching panic. \u0027Up!\u0027 he hissed. \u0027Everybody up!\u0027\\n\\n They scrambled into the tight wedge of space above the dwarf. Not a second too soon. Mulch relaxed, releasing a burst of dwarf gas that could have inflated a circus tent. He rehinged his jaw.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s better,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027Lotta air in that soil. Now would you mind getting that beam out of my face. You know how I feel about light.\u0027\\n\\n The commander obliged, switching to infra-red.\\n\\n \u0027OK, now we\u0027re up here, how do we get out? You didn\u0027t bring your cutter, I seem to remember.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf grinned. \u0027No problem. A good thief always plans on a return visit. See here.\u0027 Mulch was pointing to an area of titanium that seemed exactly like the rest of the pipe. \u0027I patched this up last time. It\u0027s just flexi-bond.\u0027\\n\\n Root had to smile. \u0027You are a cunning reprobate. How did we ever catch you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Luck,\u0027 replied the dwarf, elbowing a section of the pipe. A large circle popped out, revealing the hundred-year-old hole. \u0027Welcome to Koboi Labs.\u0027\\n\\n They clambered into a dimly lit corridor. Loaded hover trolleys were stacked four deep around the walls. Strip lighting operated with minimum illumination overhead.\\n\\n \u0027I know this place,\u0027 noted Root. \u0027I\u0027ve been here before on inspection for the special-weapons permits. We\u0027re two corridors across from the computer centre. We have a real chance of making it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about these DNA stun cannons?\u0027 enquired Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Tricky,\u0027 admitted the commander. \u0027If the cannon\u0027s onboard doesn\u0027t recognize you, you\u0027re dead. They can be programmed to reject entire species.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tricky,\u0027 agreed the manservant.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m betting they\u0027re not active,\u0027 continued Root. \u0027First, if this place is crawling with goblins, they hardly came in through the front door. And second, if Foaly is being blamed for this little uprising, Koboi will want to pretend they had no weapons, just like the LEP.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Strategy?\u0027 asked Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Not much,\u0027 admitted the commander. \u0027Once we turn the corner, we\u0027re on camera. So down the corridor as fast as you can, hit anything that gets in your way. If it has a weapon, confiscate it. Mulch, you stay here and widen the tunnel, we may need to get out fast. Ready?\u0027\\n\\n Holly extended a hand. \u0027Gentlemen, it\u0027s been a pleasure.\u0027\\n\\n The commander and manservant laid their hands on hers. \u0027Likewise.\u0027\\n\\n They headed down the corridor. Two hundred goblins versus our three virtually unarmed heroes. It was going to be close.\\n\\n \\n\\n INNER SANCTUM, KOBOI LABORATORIES\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Intruders,\u0027 squealed Opal Koboi delightedly. \u0027Inside the building.\u0027\\n\\n Cudgeon crossed to the surveillance plasma screen.\\n\\n \u0027I do believe it\u0027s Julius. Amazing. Obviously your hit team was exaggerating, General Sputa.\u0027\\n\\n Sputa licked his eyeballs furiously. Lieutenant Nyle would be losing his skin before shedding season.\\n\\n Cudgeon whispered into Opal\u0027s ear. \u0027Can we activate the DNA cannons?\u0027\\n\\n The pixie shook her head. \u0027Not immediately. They\u0027ve been reprogrammed to reject goblin DNA. It would take a few minutes.\u0027\\n\\n Cudgeon turned to the four goblin generals. \u0027Have an armoured squad come up behind and another one from the flank. We can trap them at the door. There will be no way out.\u0027\\n\\n Cudgeon stared raptly at the plasma screen. \u0027This is even better than I\u0027d planned. Now, my old friend, Julius, it\u0027s my turn to humiliate you.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis was meditating. This was a time for concentration. He sat cross-legged on a rock, visualizing the various rescue strategies that could be utilized when they returned to the Arctic. If the Mafiya managed to set up the drop before Artemis could reach them, then there was only one plan that could work. And it was a high-risk plan. Artemis searched deeper inside his brain. There must be another way.\\n\\n He was disturbed by an orchestral noise emanating from the titanium column. It sounded like a sustained note on a bassoon. Dwarf gas, he reasoned. The column had decent acoustics.\\n\\n What he needed was a brainwave. One crystal thought that would slice through this mire he had become embroiled in, and save the day.\\n\\n After eight minutes, he was interrupted again. Not gas this time. A cry for help. Mulch was in trouble, and in pain.\\n\\n Artemis was about to suggest that Butler deal with it when he realized that his bodyguard wasn\u0027t there. Off on his mission to save the Lower Elements. It was up to him.\\n\\n He poked his head into the column. It was black as the inside of an old boot, and twice as pungent. Artemis decided that an LEP helmet was his first requirement. He quickly retrieved a spare from the shuttle and, after a moment\u0027s experimentation, activated the lights and seals.\\n\\n \u0027Mulch? Are you up there?\u0027\\n\\n No reply. Could this be a trap? Was it possible that he, Artemis Fowl, was about to fall for the oldest ruse in the book? Entirely possible, he decided. But in spite of that, he couldn\u0027t really afford to take chances with that hairy little creature\u0027s life. Somewhere since Los Angeles, and against his better judgement, he had bonded with Mister Diggums. Artemis shuddered. It was happening more and more since his mother\u0027s return to sanity.\\n\\n Artemis climbed into the tube, beginning his journey to the disc of light above. The smell was horrendous. His shoes were ruined, and no amount of dry-cleaning could redeem the St Bartleby\u0027s blazer. Mulch had better be in a lot of pain.\\n\\n When he reached the entrance, he found Mulch writhing on the floor, face contorted in genuine agony.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 he asked, peeling off the helmet and kneeling by the dwarf\u0027s side.\\n\\n \u0027Blockage in my gut,\u0027 grunted the dwarf, beads of sweat sliding down his beard hairs. \u0027Something hard. Can\u0027t break it down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What can I do?\u0027 Artemis asked, though he dreaded the possible replies.\\n\\n \u0027My left boot. Take it off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your boot? Did you say boot?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 howled the dwarf, pain stiffening his entire torso. \u0027Get it off!\u0027\\n\\n Artemis couldn\u0027t stifle a relieved sigh. He\u0027d been fearing much worse. He hefted the dwarf\u0027s leg into his lap and pulled at the climbing boot.\\n\\n \u0027Nice boots,\u0027 he commented.\\n\\n -\u0027Rodeo Drive,\u0027 gasped Mulch. \u0027Now, if you wouldn\u0027t mind.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 Sorry.\u0027\\n\\n The boot slid off, revealing a not-quite-so-designer sock, complete with toe holes and darn patches.\\n\\n \u0027Little toe,\u0027 said Mulch, eyes closed with pain.\\n\\n \u0027Little toe what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Squeeze the joint. Hard.\u0027\\n\\n Squeeze the joint. Must be a reflexology thing. Every part of the body corresponds to an area of the foot. The body\u0027s keyboard, so to speak. Practised in the Orient for centuries.\\n\\n \u0027Very well. If you insist.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis placed his finger and thumb around Mulch\u0027s hairy toe. It could have been his imagination, but it seemed that the hairs parted to allow him access.\\n\\n \u0027Squeeze,\u0027 gasped the dwarf. \u0027Why aren\u0027t you squeezing?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis wasn\u0027t squeezing because his eyes were crossed, looking at the laser barrel in the middle of his forehead.\\n\\n Lieutenant Nyle, who was holding the weapon, couldn\u0027t believe his luck. He\u0027d single-handedly captured two intruders, plus he\u0027d discovered their bolt hole. Who said hanging back to avoid the fighting didn\u0027t have advantages? This was turning out to be an exceptional revolution for him. He\u0027d be colonel before shedding his third skin.\\n\\n \u0027On your feet,\u0027 he ordered, panting blue flames. Even through the translator it sounded reptilian.\\n\\n Artemis stood slowly, lifting Mulch\u0027s leg with him.The dwarf\u0027s bum-flap flopped open.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong with him anyway?\u0027 asked Nyle, bending in for a closer look.\\n\\n \u0027Something he ate,\u0027 said Artemis, and squeezed the joint.\\n\\n The resulting explosion knocked the goblin off his feet, sending him tumbling down the corridor. There was something you didn\u0027t see every day.\\n\\n Mulch hopped to his feet.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks, kid. I thought I was a goner there. Must\u0027ve been something hard. Granite maybe, or diamond.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis nodded. Not ready for words.\\n\\n \u0027Those goblins are dumb. Did you see the look on his face?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis shook his head. Still not ready.\\n\\n \u0027Do you want to go look?\u0027\\n\\n The tactless humour snapped Artemis out of his daze. \u0027That goblin. I doubt he was on his own.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch buttoned up his bum-flap. \u0027Nope. A whole squadron of \u0027em just went past. This guy must have been trying to avoid the action. Typical goblin.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis rubbed his temples. There must be something he could do to help his friends. He had the highest tested IQ in Europe, for heaven\u0027s sake.\\n\\n \u0027Mulch, I have an important question for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose I owe you one, for saving my hide.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis draped an arm around the dwarf\u0027s shoulder. \u0027I know how you got into Koboi Labs. But you couldn\u0027t go back that way, the flare would get you. So, how did you get out?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch grinned. \u0027Simple. I activated the alarm, then left in the LEP uniform I came in.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis scowled. \u0027No use, there must be another way. There has to be.\u0027\\n\\n The DNA cannons were obviously out of commission. Root was just starting to feel optimistic when he heard the thunder of approaching boots.\\n\\n \u0027D\u0027Arvit. Rumbled. You two keep going. I\u0027ll hold them here as long as I can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Commander,\u0027 said Butler. \u0027With respect, we only have one weapon, and I can hit a lot more with it than you. I\u0027ll take them coming around the corner. You try to get the door open.\u0027\\n\\n Holly opened her mouth to argue. But who was going to argue with a man that size?\\n\\n \u0027OK. Good luck. If you\u0027re wounded, lie as still as you can until I get back. Four minutes, remember.\u0027\\n\\n Butler nodded. \u0027I remember.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And, Butler?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, Captain?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That little misunderstanding last year. When you and Artemis kidnapped me.\u0027\\n\\n Butler gazed at the ceiling. He would have stared at his shoes, but Holly was in the way. \u0027Yes, that. I\u0027ve been meaning to talk to ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just forget it. After this, all square.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Holly, move it out,\u0027 ordered Root. \u0027Butler, don\u0027t let them get too close.\u0027\\n\\n Butler wrapped his fingers around the gun\u0027s moulded grip. He looked like an armed bear. \u0027They better not. For their sake.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis climbed up on a hover trolley, tapping one of the overhead conduits that ran the length of the corridor.\\n\\n \u0027This pipe appears to run along the entire ceiling structure. What is it, a ventilation system?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch snorted. \u0027I wish. It\u0027s the plasma supply for the DNA cannons.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why didn\u0027t you come in this way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, a little matter of there being enough charge in every drop of plasma to fry a troll.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis placed his palm against the metal. \u0027What if the cannons weren\u0027t operational?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Once the cannons are deactivated, the plasma is just so much radioactive slop.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Radioactive?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch tugged at his beard thoughtfully. \u0027Actually, Julius reckons the cannons have been turned off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Any way to be certain?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We could open this unopenable panel.\u0027 Mulch ran his fingers along the curved surface. \u0027Ahh, see here. A micro-keyhole. To service the cannons. Even plasma needs recharging.\u0027 He pointed to a tiny hole in the metal. It could have been a speck of dirt. \u0027Now, observe a master at work.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf fed one of his chin hairs into the hole. When the tip reappeared, Mulch plucked the hair out by the root. The hair died as soon as Mulch plucked it, stiffening in rigor mortis and retaining the precise shape of the lock\u0027s interior.\\n\\n Mulch held his breath, twisting the makeshift key. The hatch dropped open.\\n\\n \u0027That, my boy, is talent.\u0027\\n\\n Inside the pipe, an orange jelly pulsed gently. Occasional sparks roiled in its depths. The plasma was too dense even to spill from the hatch, and hung on to its cylindrical shape.\\n\\n Mulch squinted through the wobbling gel. \u0027Deactivated all right. If that stuff were live, our faces would be getting a nice tan about now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about those sparks?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Residual charge. They\u0027d give you a bit of a tingle, but nothing serious.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis nodded. \u0027Right,\u0027 he said, strapping on the helmet.\\n\\n Mulch blanched. \u0027You are not serious, MudWhelp? Do you have any idea what will happen if those cannons are activated?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m trying not to think about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s probably just as well.\u0027 The dwarf shook his head, bewildered. \u0027OK. You\u0027ve got thirty metres to go, and no more than ten minutes of air in that helmet. Keep the filters closed. The air may get a bit stale after a while, but it\u0027s better than sucking plasma. And here, take this.\u0027 He plucked the stiffened hair from the keyhole.\\n\\n \u0027What for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I presume you will want to get out again at the other end. Or hadn\u0027t you thought of that, genius boy?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis swallowed. He hadn\u0027t. There was more to this heroism thing than rushing in blindly.\\n\\n \u0027Just feed it in gently. Remember, it\u0027s hair not metal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Feed it in gently. Got it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And don\u0027t use any lights. Halogen could reactivate the plasma.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis felt his head beginning to spin.\\n\\n \u0027And make sure you get foamed as soon as you can.The anti-rad canisters are blue. They\u0027re everywhere in this facility.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Blue canisters. Anything else, Mister Diggums?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, there are the plasma snakes\\n\\n Artemis\u0027s knees almost collapsed. \u0027You\u0027re not serious?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 Mulch conceded. \u0027I\u0027m not. Now, your reach is about half a metre. So calculate for sixty pulls and then get out of there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Slightly under half a metre I\u0027d say. Perhaps sixty-three pulls.\u0027 He placed the dwarf hair inside his breast pocket.\\n\\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027Whatever, kid. It\u0027s your skin. Now in you go.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf interlaced his fingers and Artemis stepped into the makeshift stirrup. He was considering changing his mind when Mister Diggums heaved him into the pipe. The orange gel sucked him in, enveloping his body in a second.\\n\\n The plasma coiled around him like a living being, popping bubbles of air trapped in his clothing. A residual spark brushed his leg, sending sharp pain spasming through his body. A bit of a tingle?\\n\\n Artemis gazed out through the orange gel. Mulch was there giving him the thumbs up. Grinning like a loon. Artemis decided that if he made it through this, then he would have to place the dwarf on the payroll.\\n\\n He began to crawl blindly. One pull, two pulls ...\\n\\n Sixty-three seemed a long way off.\\n\\n Butler cocked the Sig Sauer. The footsteps were ear-splitting now, bouncing off the metal walls. Shadows stretched around the corner, ahead of their owners. The manservant took approximate aim.\\n\\n A head appeared. Froglike. Licking its own eyeballs. Butler pulled the trigger. The slug punched a melon-sized hole in the wall above the goblin\u0027s head. The head was hurriedly withdrawn. Of course, Butler had missed on purpose. Scared was always better than dead. But it couldn\u0027t last forever. Twelve more shots to be precise.\\n\\n The goblins grew braver, sneaking out further and further. Eventually, Butler knew he would be forced to shoot one.\\n\\n The manservant decided that it was time to go close-quarters. He rose from his hunkers, making slightly less noise than a panther, and hurtled down the corridor towards the enemy.\\n\\n There were only two men on the planet better educated in the various martial arts than Butler, and he was related to one of them. The other lived on an island in the South China Seas and spent his days meditating and beating up palm trees. You really had to feel sorry for those goblins.\\n\\n The B\u0027wa Kell had two guards on the sanctum door. Both armed to the teeth and both as thick as several short planks. In spite of repeated warnings, they were both falling asleep inside their helmets when the elves came running around the corner.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 mumbled one. \u0027Elves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Huh?\u0027 said the other, the denser of the two.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t matter,\u0027 said number one. \u0027LEP don\u0027t got no guns.\u0027\\n\\n Number two gave his eyeballs a lick. \u0027Yeah, but they sure are irritable.\u0027\\n\\n And that was when Holly\u0027s boot impacted with his chest, slamming him into the wall.\\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 complained number one, bringing up his own gun. \u0027Not fair.\u0027\\n\\n Root didn\u0027t bother with fancy spinning kicks, preferring instead to body-slam the sentry against the titanium door.\\n\\n \u0027There,\u0027 panted Holly. \u0027Two down. That wasn\u0027t so hard.\u0027 A premature statement as it happened. Because that was when the rest of the two-hundred-strong B\u0027wa Kell squadron thundered down the perpendicular corridor. \\n\\n \u0027That wasn\u0027t so hard,\u0027 mimicked the commander, curling his fingers into fists.\\n\\n Artemis\u0027s concentration was failing him. There seemed to be more sparks now, and each shock disrupted his focus. He had lost count twice. He was at fifty-four now. Or fifty-six. The difference was life or death.\\n\\n He trawled ahead, reaching out one arm and then the other, swimming through a turgid sea of gel. Vision was next to useless. Everything was orange. And the only confirmation he had that any progress was being made was when his knee sank into a recess, where the plasma diverted into a cannon.\\n\\n Artemis punched one last time through the gel, filling his lungs with stale air — sixty-three. That was it. Soon the air purifiers in his helmet would be useless and he would be breathing carbon dioxide.\\n\\n He placed his fingertips against the pipe\u0027s inner curve, searching for a keyhole. Again his eyes were no help. He couldn\u0027t even activate the helmet lamps for fear of igniting a river of plasma.\\n\\n Nothing. No indent. He was going to die here alone. He would never be great. Artemis felt his brain going, spiralling off into a black tunnel. Concentrate, he told himself. Focus. There was a spark approaching. A silver star in the sunset. It coiled lazily along the tube, lighting each section it passed.\\n\\n There! A hole. The hole. Revealed for a moment by the passing spark. Artemis reached into his pocket like a drunken swimmer, pulling out the dwarf hair. Would it work? There was no reason this access port should have a different locking mechanism.\\n\\n Artemis slid the hair into the keyhole. Gently. He squinted through the gel. Was it going in? He thought so. Perhaps sixty per cent sure. It would have to be enough.\\n\\n Artemis twisted. The flap dropped open. He imagined Mulch\u0027s grin. That, my boy, is talent.\\n\\n It was quite possible that every enemy he had in the underworld was waiting outside that hatch, big nasty guns pointed at his head. At that point, Artemis didn\u0027t much care. He couldn\u0027t bear one more of his own oxygen-depleted breaths or one more excruciating shock to his body.\\n\\n So, Artemis Fowl poked his helmet through the plasma\u0027s surface. He flipped the visor, savouring what could very well be his last breath. Lucky for him, the room\u0027s occupants were looking at the view screen.\\n\\n Watching his friends fight for their lives. Not so lucky for his friends.\\n\\n There are too many, thought Butler as he rounded the corner and saw almost an entire army of B\u0027wa Kell slotting fresh batteries into their weapons.\\n\\n The goblins, when they noticed Butler, began to think things like, O gods, it\u0027s a troll in clothes; or, why didn\u0027t I listen to Mummy and stay out of the gangs?\\n\\n Then Butler was above them and on the way down. He landed like the proverbial tonne of bricks, except with considerably more precision. Three goblins were out cold before they knew they\u0027d been hit. One shot himself in the foot and several others lay down pretending to be unconscious.\\n\\n Artemis watched it all on the control room\u0027s plasma screen. Along with all the other occupants of the inner sanctum. It was entertainment to them. TV. The goblin generals chuckled and winced as Butler decimated their men. It was all immaterial. There were hundreds of goblins in the building and no way into this room.\\n\\n Artemis had seconds to decide on a course of action. Seconds. And he had no idea how to use any of this technology. He scanned the walls below him for something he could use. Anything.\\n\\n There. On a small picture-in-picture screen, away from the main console, was Foaly. Trapped in the Operations\u0027 booth. The centaur would have a plan. He had certainly had time to come up with one. Artemis knew that as soon as he emerged from the conduit he was a target. They would kill him without hesitation.\\n\\n He dragged himself from within the tube, falling to Earth with a thick slap. His saturated clothes slowed his progress to the monitor bank. Heads were turning, he could see them out the corner of his eye. Figures came his way. He didn\u0027t know how many.\\n\\n There was a reed mike below Foaly\u0027s image. Artemis pressed the button.\\n\\n \u0027Foaly!\u0027 he rasped, globs of gel splatting on to the console.\u0027Can you hear me?\u0027\\n\\n The centaur reacted instantly. \u0027Fowl? What happened to you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Five seconds, Foaly. I need a plan or we\u0027re all dead.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly nodded curtly. \u0027I\u0027ve got one ready. Put me on all screens.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What? How?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Press the conference button. Yellow. A circle with lines shooting out, like the sun. Do you see it?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis saw it. He pressed it. Then something pressed him. Very painfully.\\n\\n General Scalene first noticed the creature flopping out of the plasma pipe. What was it? A pixie? No. No, by all the gods. It was human.\\n\\n \u0027Look!\u0027 he cackled. \u0027A Mud Man.\u0027\\n\\n The others were oblivious, too interested in the spectacle on-screen.\\n\\n But not Cudgeon. A human in the inner sanctum. How could this be? He seized Scalene by the shoulders. \u0027Kill him!\u0027\\n\\n All the generals were listening now. There was killing to be done. With no danger to themselves.They would do this the old-fashioned way: with claws and fireballs.\\n\\n The human stumbled to one of the consoles and they surrounded him, tongues dangling excitedly. Sputa spun the human around to face his fate.\\n\\n One by one, the generals conjured fireballs around their fists, closing in for the kill. But then something made them completely forget the injured human. Cudgeon\u0027s face had appeared on all the screens. And the B\u0027wa Kell executive didn\u0027t like what it was saying:\\n\\n \u0027— Just when things are at their most desperate, I shall instruct Opal to return weapons control to the LEP. The B\u0027wa Kell will be rendered unconscious, and you will be blamed for the entire affair, provided you survive, which I doubt -\u0027\\n\\n Sputa whirled on his ally. \u0027Cudgeon! What does this mean?\u0027\\n\\n The generals advanced, hissing and spitting. \u0027Treachery, Cudgeon! Treachery!\u0027\\n\\n Cudgeon was not unduly worried. \u0027OK,\u0027 he said. \u0027Treachery.\u0027\\n\\n It took Cudgeon a moment to figure out what had happened. It was Foaly. He must have recorded their conversation somehow. How tiresome. Still, you had to hand it to the centaur. He was resourceful.\\n\\n Cudgeon quickly crossed to the main console, shutting off the broadcast. It wouldn\u0027t do for Opal to hear the rest of it. Particularly the part concerning her tragic accident. He really would have to cut out this grandstanding. Still, no matter. Everything was on track.\\n\\n \u0027Treachery!\u0027 hissed Scalene.\\n\\n \u0027OK,\u0027 admitted Cudgeon. \u0027Treachery.\u0027 And directly after that he said, \u0027Computer, activate DNA cannons. Authorization Cudgeon B. Alpha alpha two two.\u0027\\n\\n On her hover chair, Opal spun with sheer joy, clapping her tiny hands in delight. Briar was sooo ugly, but he was sooo evil.\\n\\n Throughout Koboi Labs, robot DNA cannons perked up in their cradles and ran swift self-diagnostics. Apart from a slight drain in the inner sanctum, everything was in order. And so, without further ado, they began to obey their program parameters and target anything with goblin DNA at a rate often blasts per second.\\n\\n It was swift and, as with everything Koboi, efficient. In less than five seconds, the cannons settled back into their cradles. Mission accomplished: two hundred unconscious goblins throughout the facility.\\n\\n \u0027Phew,\u0027 said Holly, stepping over rows of snoring goblins. \u0027Close one.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me about it,\u0027 agreed Root.\\n\\n Cudgeon kicked Sputa\u0027s sleeping body.\\n\\n \u0027You see, you haven\u0027t accomplished anything, Artemis Fowl,\u0027 he said, drawing his Redboy.\\n\\n \u0027Your friends are out there. You\u0027re in here. And the goblins are unconscious, soon to be mind-wiped with some particularly unstable chemicals. Just as I planned.\u0027 He smiled at Opal hovering above them. \u0027Just as we planned.\u0027\\n\\n Opal returned the smile.\\n\\n At another time, Artemis would have been forced to pass a snide comment. But the possibility of imminent death was occupying his thoughts for the moment.\\n\\n \u0027Now, I simply reprogram the cannons to target your friends, return power to the LEP cannons, and take over the world. And nobody can get in here to stop me.\u0027\\n\\n Of course, you should never say something like that, especially when you\u0027re an arch-villain. It\u0027s just asking for trouble.\\n\\n Butler hurried down the corridor, catching up with the others outside the inner sanctum. He could see Artemis\u0027s predicament through the door\u0027s quartz pane. In spite of all his efforts, Master Artemis had still managed to place himself in mortal danger. How was a bodyguard supposed to do his job when his charge insisted on jumping into bear pits, so to speak?\\n\\n Butler felt the testosterone building in his system. One door was all that separated him from Artemis. One little door, designed to withstand fairies with ray guns. He took several steps backwards.\\n\\n Holly could tell what he was thinking. \u0027Don\u0027t bother. That door is reinforced.\u0027\\n\\n The manservant didn\u0027t answer. He couldn\u0027t. The real Butler was submerged beneath layers of adrenalin and brute force.\\n\\n With a roar, Butler charged the entrance, concentrating all of his considerable might in the triangular point of his shoulder. It was a blow that would have felled a medium-sized hippopotamus. And while this door was tested for plasma dispersion and moderate physical resistance, it was certainly not Butler-proof. The metal portal crumpled like tin foil.\\n\\n Butler\u0027s momentum took him halfway across the inner sanctum\u0027s rubber tiling. Holly and Root followed, pausing only to grab some Softnose lasers from the unconscious goblins.\\n\\n Cudgeon moved fast, dragging Artemis upright. \u0027Don\u0027t move, any of you. Or I\u0027ll kill the Mud Boy.\u0027\\n\\n Butler kept right on going. His last rational thought had been to disable Cudgeon. Now this was his sole aim in life. He raced forward, arms outstretched.\\n\\n Holly dived desperately, latching on to Butler\u0027s belt. He dragged her like a string of cans behind a wedding car.\\n\\n \u0027Butler, stop,\u0027 she grunted.\\n\\n The bodyguard ignored her.\\n\\n Holly hung on, digging in her heels. \u0027Stop!\u0027 she repeated, this time layering her voice with the mesmer.\\n\\n Butler seemed to wake up. He shook the cave man from his system.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right, Mud Man,\u0027 said Cudgeon. \u0027Listen to Captain Short. Surely we can work something out here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No deals, Briar,\u0027 said Root. \u0027It\u0027s all over, so just put the Mud Boy down.\u0027\\n\\n Cudgeon cocked the Redboy. ‘I’ll put him down all right.\u0027\\n\\n This was Butler\u0027s worst nightmare. His charge was in the hands of a psychopath with nothing to lose. And there was nothing he could do about it.\\n\\n A phone rang.\\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s mine,\u0027 said Artemis automatically.\\n\\n Another ring. Definitely his mobile phone. Amazing the thing worked at all really, considering what it had been through. Artemis ripped open the case.\\n\\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n It was one of those frozen moments. Nobody knew what to expect.\\n\\n Artemis tossed the handset at Opal Koboi. \u0027It\u0027s for\\n\\n The pixie swooped low to catch the tiny mobile phone. Cudgeon\u0027s chest heaved. His body knew what was happening even if his brain hadn\u0027t figured it out yet.\\n\\n Opal placed the tiny speaker to her pointed ear.\\n\\n \u0027— Really, Foaly,\u0027 said Cudgeon\u0027s voice. \u0027Do you think I\u0027d go to all this trouble to share power? Oh no. As soon as this charade is over, Miss Koboi will have a tragic accident. Perhaps several tragic accidents — \u0027\\n\\n All colour drained from Opal\u0027s face. \u0027You!\u0027 she screeched.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a trick!\u0027 protested Cudgeon. \u0027They\u0027re trying to turn us against each other.\u0027\\n\\n But his eyes told the real story.\\n\\n Pixies are feisty creatures, in spite of their size. They put up with so much and then explode. For Opal Koboi, it was explosion time. She manipulated the Hoverboy\u0027s controls, dropping in a steep dive.\\n\\n Cudgeon didn\u0027t hesitate. He put two bursts into the chair, but the thick cushion protected its pilot.\\n\\n Opal Koboi flew straight at her former partner. When the elf raised his arms to protect himself, Artemis slid to the floor. Briar Cudgeon was not so lucky. He became entangled in the Hoverboy\u0027s safety rail and was borne aloft by the wildcat pixie. They whirled around the chamber ricocheting off several walls before crashing straight through the open plasma panel in the cannon Pipe - Unfortunately for Cudgeon, the plasma was now active. He had activated it himself. But this irony did not occur to him as he was fried by a million radioactive tendrils.\\n\\n Koboi was lucky. She was pitched from the hoverchair and lay moaning on the rubber tiles.\\n\\n Butler was on the move before Cudgeon landed. He flipped Artemis over, checking his frame for wounds. A couple of scratches. Superficial. Nothing a shot of blue sparks wouldn\u0027t take care of.\\n\\n Holly checked Opal Koboi\u0027s status.\\n\\n \u0027She conscious?\u0027 asked the commander.\\n\\n Koboi\u0027s eyes flickered open. Holly shut them with a swift rabbit punch to the forehead. \u0027Nope,\u0027 she said innocently. \u0027Out cold.\u0027\\n\\n Root took one look at Cudgeon and realized there was no point checking for vitals. Maybe he was better off. The alternative would have been a couple of centuries in Howler\u0027s Peak.\\n\\n Artemis noticed movement by the door. It was Mulch. He was grinning and waving. Waving goodbye, just in case Julius forgot about his two-day head start. The dwarf pointed to a blue canister mounted on a wall bracket and he was gone.\\n\\n \u0027Butler,\u0027 rasped Artemis, with the absolute last ounce of his strength. \u0027Could someone spray me down? And then could we please go to Murmansk?\u0027\\n\\n Butler was mystified. \u0027Spray? What spray?\u0027\\n\\n Holly unhooked the anti-rad foam canister, flipping the safety catch. \u0027Allow me,\u0027 she said, grinning. \u0027It would be my pleasure.\u0027\\n\\n She directed a jet of foul-smelling foam at Artemis. In seconds, he resembled a half-melted snowman. Holly laughed. Who said there were no perks in law enforcement?\\n\\n \\n\\n OPERATIONS\u0027 BOOTH\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Once the cannon plasma had short-circuited Cudgeon\u0027s remote control, power came rushing back to the Operations\u0027 booth. Foaly lost no time in activating the subcutaneous sleepers planted below goblin offenders\u0027 skin. That put half of the B\u0027wa Kell out of action straight away. Then he reprogrammed Police Plaza\u0027s own DNA cannons for non-lethal bursts. It was all over in seconds. Captain Kelp\u0027s first thought was for his subordinates. \u0027Sound off,\u0027 he shouted, his voice slicing through the chaos. \u0027Did we lose anyone?\u0027\\n\\n The squadron leaders answered in sequence, confirming that there had been no fatalities.\\n\\n \u0027We were lucky,\u0027 remarked a warlock medic. \u0027There\u0027s not a drop of magic left in the building. Not even a medi-pac. The next officer to go down would have stayed down.\u0027\\n\\n Trouble turned his attention to the Ops\u0027 booth. He did not look amused.\\n\\n Foaly depolarized the quartz window and opened a channel. \u0027Hey, guys. I wasn\u0027t behind this. It was Cudgeon. I just saved everyone. I sent a sound recording to a mobile phone; that wasn\u0027t easy. You should be giving me a medal.\u0027\\n\\n Trouble clenched his fist. \u0027Yeah, Foaly, come on out here and let me give you your medal.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly may not have had many social skills, but he knew thinly veiled threats when he heard them.\\n\\n \u0027Oh no. Not me. I\u0027m staying right here until Commander Root gets back. He can explain everything.\u0027\\n\\n The centaur blacked out the window and busied himself running a bug sweep. He would isolate every last trace of Opal Koboi and flush it out of the system. Paranoid was he? Who was the paranoid one now, Holly? Who was the paranoid one now?\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/256.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
