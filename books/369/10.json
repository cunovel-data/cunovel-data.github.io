{"id":10739,"no":10,"title":"Chapter 11 Mulch Ado About Nothing","content":"LOS ANGELES, USA\\n\\n \\n\\n MULCH Diggums was, in fact, outside the apartment of an Oscar-winning actress.\\n\\n Of course, she didn\u0027t know he was there.\\n\\n And, naturally, he was up to no good. Once a thief, always a thief.\\n\\n Not that Mulch needed the money. He\u0027d done very well out of the Artemis Fowl Affair. Well enough to take out a lease on a penthouse apartment in Beverly Hills. He\u0027d stocked the apartment with a Pioneer entertainment system, a full DVD library and enough beef jerky to last a lifetime. Time for a decade of rest and relaxation.\\n\\n But life is not like that. It refuses to curl up and sit quietly in a corner. The habits of several centuries would not go away. Halfway through the James Bond Collection, Mulch realized that he missed the bad old days. Soon the penthouse suite\u0027s reclusive occupant was taking midnight strolls. These strolls generally ended up inside other people\u0027s homes.\\n\\n Initially Mulch just visited, savouring the thrill of defeating sophisticated Mud Man security systems. Then he began to take trophies. Small things — a crystal goblet, an ashtray, or a cat if he was peckish. But soon Mulch Diggums began to crave the old notoriety and his pilferings grew larger. Gold bars, goose egg diamonds, or pit bull terriers if he was really famished.\\n\\n The Oscar thing began quite by accident. He nabbed one as a curiosity on a midweek break to New York. Best original screenplay. The following morning he was front page news coast to coast. You\u0027d think he\u0027d ripped off a medical convoy instead of a gilded statuette. Mulch, of course, was delighted. He\u0027d found his new nocturnal pastime.\\n\\n In the next fortnight, Mulch filched best soundtrack and best special effects Academy Awards. The tabloids went crazy. They even gave him a nickname: the Grouch, after another well-known Oscar. When Mulch read that one, his toes wriggled for joy. And dwarf toes wriggling are quite a sight. They are as nimble as fingers, double-jointed and the less said about the smell the better. Mulch\u0027s mission became clear. He had to assemble an entire set.\\n\\n Over the next six months, the Grouch struck all across the United States. He even made a trip to Italy to collect a best foreign-language film award. He had a special cabinet made, with tinted glass that could be blacked out at the touch of a button. Mulch Diggums felt alive again.\\n\\n Of course, every Oscar winner on the planet trebled their security, which was just the way Mulch liked it. There was no challenge in breaking into a shack on the beach. High rise and high-tech. That\u0027s what the public wanted. So that\u0027s what the Grouch gave them. The papers ate it up. He was a hero. During the daylight hours, when he couldn\u0027t venture outside, Mulch busied himself writing the screenplay of his own exploits.\\n\\n Tonight was a big night. The last statuette. He was going for a best actress award. And not just any old best actress. Tonight\u0027s target was the tempestuous Jamaican beauty, Maggie V. This year\u0027s winner for her portrayal of Precious, a tempestuous Jamaican beauty. Maggie V had stated publicly that if the Grouch tried anything in her apartment, he would get a lot more than he had bargained for. How could Mulch resist a challenge like that?\\n\\n The building itself was easy to locate, a ten-storey block of glass and steel just off Sunset Boulevard, a midnight stroll south of Mulch\u0027s own home. So one cloudy night, the intrepid dwarf packed his tools, preparing to burglarize his way into the history books.\\n\\n Maggie V was on the top floor. There was no question of going up the stairs, lift or shaft. It would have to be an outside job.\\n\\n In preparation for the climb, Mulch had not had anything to drink in two days. Dwarf pores are not just for sweating, they can take in moisture too. Very handy when you are trapped in a cave-in for days on end. Even if you can\u0027t get your mouth to a drink, every centimetre of skin can leech water from the surrounding earth. When a dwarf was thirsty, as Mulch was now, his pores opened to the size of pinholes and began to suck like crazy. This could be extremely useful if, say, you had to climb up the side of a tall building.\\n\\n Mulch took off his shoes and gloves, donned a stolen LEP helmet and began to climb.\\n\\n \\n\\n CHUTE E93\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly could feel the commander\u0027s glare crisping the hairs on the back of her neck. She tried to ignore it, concentrating on not dashing the Atlantean ambassador\u0027s shuttle against the walls of the Arctic chute.\\n\\n \u0027So, all this time, you knew Mulch Diggums was alive?\u0027\\n\\n Holly nudged the starboard thruster to avoid a missile of half-melted rock. \u0027Not for sure. Foaly just had this theory.\u0027\\n\\n The commander wrung an imaginary neck. \u0027Foaly! Why am I not surprised?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis smirked from his seat in the passenger area.\\n\\n \u0027Now, you two, we need to work together as a team.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So tell me about Foaly\u0027s theory, Captain,\u0027 ordered Root, belting himself into the co-pilot\u0027s seat.\\n\\n Holly activated a static wash on the shuttle\u0027s external cameras. Positive and negative charges dislodged the sheets of dust from the lenses.\\n\\n \u0027Foaly thought Mulch\u0027s death a bit suspicious, given that he was the best tunnel fairy in the business.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So why didn\u0027t he come to me?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It was just a hunch. With respect, you know what you\u0027re like with hunches, Commander.\u0027\\n\\n Root nodded grudgingly. It was true, he didn\u0027t have time for hunches. It was hard evidence, or get out of my office until you\u0027ve got some.\\n\\n \u0027The centaur did a bit of investigating in his own time. The first thing he realized was that the gold recovered was a bit light. I negotiated for the return of half the ransom and, by Foaly\u0027s reckoning, the cart was about two dozen bars short.\u0027\\n\\n The commander lit one of his trademark fungus cigars. He had to admit it sounded promising: gold missing, Mulch Diggums within a hundred miles. Two and two make four.\\n\\n \u0027As you know, it\u0027s standard procedure to spray any LEP property with solinium-based tracker, including the ransom gold. So, Foaly runs a scan for solinium, and he picks up hot spots all over Los Angeles. Particularly at the Crowley Hotel in Beverly Hills. When he hacks into the building computer, he finds the penthouse resident is listed as one Lance Digger.\u0027\\n\\n Root\u0027s pointy ears quivered. \u0027Digger?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly,\u0027 said Holly, nodding. \u0027A bit more than coincidence. Foaly came to me at that point, and I advised him to get some satellite photos before taking the file to you. Except ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Except Mister Digger is proving very elusive. Am I right?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dead on.\u0027\\n\\n Root\u0027s colouring went from rose to tomato. \u0027Mulch, that rascal. How did he do it?\u0027\\n\\n Holly shrugged. \u0027We\u0027re guessing he transferred his iris-cam to some local wildlife, maybe a rabbit.Then collapsed the tunnel.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So the life signs we were reading belonged to some rabbit.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. In theory.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll kill him,\u0027 exclaimed Root, pounding the control panel. \u0027Can\u0027t this bucket go any faster?\u0027\\n\\n \\n\\n LOS ANGELES\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch scaled the building without much difficulty. There were external closed-circuit cameras, but the helmet\u0027s ion filter showed exactly where these cameras were pointed. It was a simple matter to crawl along the blind spots.\\n\\n Within an hour, the dwarf was suckered outside Maggie V\u0027s apartment on the tenth floor. The windows were triple glazed with a bulletproof coating. Movie stars. Paranoid, every one of them.\\n\\n Naturally, there was an alarm point sitting on top of the pane and a motion sensor crouching on a wall like a frozen cricket. Only to be expected.\\n\\n Mulch melted a hole in the glass with a bottle of dwarf rock polish, used to clean up diamonds in the mines. Humans actually cut diamonds to shine them. Imagine. Half the stone down the drain.\\n\\n Next, the Grouch used the helmet\u0027s ion filter to sweep the room for the motion sensor\u0027s range. The red ion-stream revealed that the sensor was focused on the floor. No matter. Mulch intended going along the wall.\\n\\n Pores still crying out for water, the dwarf crept along the partition, making maximum use of a stainless-steel shelving system that almost completely surrounded the main sitting room.\\n\\n The next step was to find the actual Oscar. It could be hidden anywhere, including under Maggie V\u0027s pillow, but this room was as good a place to start as any. You never knew, he might get lucky.\\n\\n Mulch activated the helmet\u0027s X-ray filter, scanning the walls for a safe. Nothing. He tried the floor; humans were getting smarter these days. There, under a fake zebra rug, a metal cuboid. Easy.\\n\\n The Grouch approached the motion sensor from above, very gently twisting the neck until the gadget was surveying the ceiling. The floor was now safe.\\n\\n Mulch dropped to the rug, testing the surface with his tactile toes. No pressure pads sewn into the rug\u0027s lining. He rolled back the fake skin, revealing a hatch in the wooden floor. The joins were barely visible to the naked eye. But Mulch was an expert and his eyes weren\u0027t naked, they were aided by LEP zoom lenses.\\n\\n He wormed a nail into the crack, flipping the hatch. The safe itself was a bit of a disappointment. Not even lead-lined; he could see right into the mechanism with the X-ray filter. A simple combination lock. Only three digits.\\n\\n Mulch turned the filter off. What was the point in breaking a see-through lock? Instead he put his ear to the door, jiggling the dial. In fifteen seconds the door was open at his feet.\\n\\n The Oscar\u0027s gold plating winked at him. Mulch made a big mistake at that moment. He relaxed. In the Grouch\u0027s mind he was already back in his own apartment, swigging from a two-litre bottle of ice-cold water. And relaxed thieves are destined for prison.\\n\\n Mulch neglected to check the statuette for traps, plucking it straight from the safe. If he had checked he would have realized that there was a wire attached magnetically to the base. When the Oscar was moved, a circuit was broken allowing all hell to break loose.\\n\\n \\n\\n CHUTE E93\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly set the auto-pilot to hover at three thousand metres below the surface. She slapped herself on the chest, releasing the harness, and joined the others in the rear of the shuttle.\\n\\n \u0027Two problems. Firstly, if we go any lower, we\u0027ll be picked up on the scanners, presuming they\u0027re still operating.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why am I not looking forward to number two?\u0027 asked Butler.\\n\\n \u0027Secondly, this part of the chute was retired when we pulled out of the Arctic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which means?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Which means the supply tunnels were collapsed. We have no way into the chute system without supply tunnels.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No problem,\u0027 declared Root. \u0027We blast the wall.\u0027\\n\\n Holly sighed. \u0027With what, Commander? This is a diplomatic craft. We don\u0027t have any cannons.\u0027\\n\\n Butler plucked two concussor eggs from a pouch on his Moonbelt. \u0027Will these do? Foaly thought they might come in handy.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis groaned. If he didn\u0027t know better, he\u0027d swear the manservant was enjoying this.\\n\\n \\n\\n LOS ANGELES\\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Uh oh,\u0027 breathed Mulch.\\n\\n In a matter of moments, things had gone from rosy to extremely dangerous. Once the security circuit was broken, a side door slid open admitting two very large German shepherds. The ultimate watchdogs. They were followed by their handler, a huge man covered in protective clothing. It looked as though he were dressed in doormats. Obviously the dogs were unstable.\\n\\n \u0027Nice doggies,\u0027 said Mulch, slowly unbuttoning his bum-flap.\\n\\n \\n\\n CHUTE E93\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly nudged the flight controls, inching the shuttle closer to the chute wall.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s as near as we get,\u0027 she said into her helmet mike. \u0027Any closer and the thermals could flip us against the rock face.\u0027\\n\\n Thermals?\u0027 growled Root. \u0027You never said anything about thermals before I climbed out here.\u0027\\n\\n The commander was spread-eagled on the port wing, a concussor egg jammed down each boot.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry, Commander, someone has to fly this bird.\u0027 Root muttered under his breath, dragging himself closer to the wing-tip. While the turbulence was nowhere as severe as it would have been on a moving aircraft, the buffeting thermals were quite enough to shake the commander like dice in a cup. All that kept him going was the thought of his fingers tightening around Mulch Diggums\u0027s throat.\\n\\n \u0027Another metre,\u0027 he gasped into the mike. At least they had communications, the shuttle had its own local intercom. \u0027One more metre and I can make it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No go, Commander. That\u0027s your lot.\u0027\\n\\n Root risked a peek into the abyss. The chute stretched on forever, winding down to the orange magma glow at the Earth\u0027s core. This was madness. Crazy. There must be another way. At this point, the commander would even be willing to risk an over-ground flight.\\n\\n Then Julius Root had a vision. It could have been the sulphur fumes, stress or even lack of food. But the commander could have sworn Mulch Diggums\u0027s features appeared before him, etched into the rock face. The face was sucking on a cigar and smirking.\\n\\n His determination returned in a surge. Bested by a criminal. Not likely.\\n\\n Root clambered to his feet, drying sweaty palms on his jumpsuit. The thermals plucked at his limbs like mischievous ghosts.\\n\\n \u0027Ready to put some distance between us and this soon-to-be hole?\u0027 he shouted into the mike.\\n\\n \u0027Bet on it, Commander,\u0027 responded Holly. \u0027Soon as we have you back in the hold, we\u0027re out of here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027OK. Standby.\u0027\\n\\n Root fired the piton dart from his belt. The titanium head sank easily into the rock. The commander knew that tiny charges inside the dart would blow out two flanges securing it inside the face. Five metres. Not a great distance to swing on a piton cord. But it wasn\u0027t the swing really. It was the bone-crushing drop and the lack of handholds on the chute wall.\\n\\n Come on, Julius, sniggered the Mulch edifice. Let\u0027s see what you look like splattered against a wall.\\n\\n \u0027You shut your mouth, convict,\u0027 roared the commander. And he jumped, swinging into the void.\\n\\n The rock face rushed out to meet him, knocking the breath from his lungs. Root ground his back teeth against the pain. He hoped nothing was broken, because after the Russian trip, he didn\u0027t even have enough magic left to make a daisy bloom, never mind heal a fractured rib.\\n\\n The shuttle\u0027s forward lights picked out the laser burns where the LEP tunnel dwarfs had sealed the supply chute. That weld line would be the weak spot. Root slotted the concussor eggs along two indents.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m coming for you, Diggums,\u0027 he muttered, crushing the capsule detonators embedded in each one. Thirty seconds now.\\n\\n Root aimed a second piton dart at the shuttle wing. An easy shot, he made this kind of thing in his sleep in the sim-range. Unfortunately, the simulators didn\u0027t have thermals fouling things up at the last moment.\\n\\n Just as the commander fired his dart, the edge of a particularly strong whirlpool of gas caught the shuttle\u0027s rear, spinning it forty degrees anti-clockwise. The dart missed by a metre. It spun into the abyss, trailing the commander\u0027s lifeline behind it. Root had two options: he could rewind the cord using his belt winch, or he could jettison the piton and try again with his spare. Julius unhooked the cord; it would be faster to try again. A good plan, had he not already used his spare to get them out from under the ice. The commander remembered this half a second after he\u0027d cut loose his last piton.\\n\\n \u0027D\u0027Arvit,\u0027 he swore, patting his belt for a dart which he knew wouldn\u0027t be there.\\n\\n \u0027Trouble, Commander?\u0027 asked Holly, her voice strained from wrestling with the controls.\\n\\n \u0027No pitons left, and the charges are set.\u0027\\n\\n There followed a brief silence. Very brief. No time for lengthy think-tanks. Root glanced at his moonomenter. Twenty-five seconds and counting.\\n\\n When Holly\u0027s voice came over the headset, it was not bursting with enthusiasm or confidence.\\n\\n \u0027Er ... Commander. You wearing any metal?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 replied Root, puzzled. \u0027My breastplate, buckle, insignia, blaster. Why?\u0027\\n\\n Holly nudged the shuttle a shade closer. Any nearer was suicide.\\n\\n \u0027Put it like this. How fond are you of your ribs?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think I know how to get you out of there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I could tell you, but you\u0027re not going to like it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tell me, Captain. That\u0027s a direct order.\u0027\\n\\n Holly told him. He didn\u0027t like it.\\n\\n \\n\\n LOS ANGELES\\n\\n \\n\\n Dwarf gas. Not the most tasteful of subjects; even dwarfs don\u0027t like to talk about it. Many a dwarf wife is known to scold her husband for venting gas at home and not leaving it in the tunnels. The fact is that, genetically, dwarfs are prone to gas attacks, especially if they\u0027ve been eating clay in the mine. A dwarf can take in several kilos of dirt a second through his unhinged jaws. That\u0027s a lot of clay, with a lot of air in it. All this waste has to go somewhere. So it goes south. To put it politely, the tunnels are self-sealing.\\n\\n Mulch hadn\u0027t eaten clay in months, but he still had a few bubbles of gas at his disposal when he needed them.\\n\\n The dogs were poised to attack. Slobber hung in ribbons from their gaping jaws. He would be torn to pieces. Mulch concentrated. The familiar bubbling began in his stomach, pulling it out of shape. It felt as though a couple of gnome garbage wrestlers were going a few rounds in there. The dwarf gritted his teeth, this was going to be a big one.\\n\\n The handler blew a football whistle. The dogs lunged forward like torpedoes with teeth. Mulch let go with a stream of gas, blowing a hole in the rug and propelling himself to the ceiling, where his thirsty pores anchored him. Safe. For the moment.\\n\\n The German shepherds were particularly surprised. In their time they had chewed their way through most creatures in the food chain. This was something new. And not altogether pleasant.You have to remember that a dog\u0027s nose is far more sensitive than a human one.\\n\\n The handler blew his whistle a few more times, but any control he might have had disappeared the moment Mulch flew through the air on a jet of recycled wind. As soon as the dogs\u0027 nasal passages cleared, they began to leap, teeth gnashing at the apex.\\n\\n Mulch swallowed. Dogs are smarter than the average goblin. It was only a matter of time before they thought to scale the furniture and make a jump from there.\\n\\n Mulch made for the window, but the handler was there before him, blocking the hole with his padded body. Mulch noticed him fumbling with a weapon at his belt. This was getting serious. Dwarfs are many things, but bulletproof is not one of them.\\n\\n To make matters worse, Maggie V appeared at the bedroom door, brandishing a chrome baseball bat. This was not the Maggie V the public was used to. Her face was covered with a green mask, and there appeared to be a tea bag taped under each eye.\\n\\n \u0027Now we have you, Mister Grouch,\u0027 she gloated. \u0027And suction pads aren\u0027t going to save you.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch realized that his career as the Grouch was over. Whether he escaped or not, the LAPD would be visiting every dwarf in the city come sunrise.\\n\\n Mulch only had one card left to play. The gift of tongues. Every fairy has a natural grasp of languages, as all tongues are based on Gnommish, if you trace them back far enough. Including American Dog.\\n\\n \u0027Arf\u0027 grunted Mulch. \u0027Arf, rrruff rruff.\u0027\\n\\n The dogs froze. One attempted to freeze in mid-leap, landing on his partner. They chewed each other\u0027s tails for a moment, then remembered that there was a creature on the ceiling barking at them. His accent was terrible, something mid-European. But it was Dog nevertheless.\\n\\n \u0027Aroof?\u0027 enquired dog number one. \u0027Whaddya sayin\u0027?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch pointed at the handler. \u0027 Woof arfy arrooof! That human has a big bone inside his shirt,\u0027 he grunted. (Obviously, that\u0027s been translated.)\\n\\n The German shepherds pounced on their handler, Mulch scampered through the hole in the window, and Maggie V howled so much that her mask cracked and her tea bags fell off. And even though the Grouch knew that this particular chapter in his career was closed, the weight of Maggie V\u0027s Academy Award inside his shirt gave him no little satisfaction.\\n\\n \\n\\n CHUTE E93\\n\\n \\n\\n Twenty seconds left before the concussors blew, and the commander was still flattened against the chute wall. They had no wing sets, and no time to get one outside even if they had. If they couldn\u0027t pull Root out of there right now, then he\u0027d be blown off the wall and into the abyss. And.magic didn\u0027t work on melted slop. There was only one option. Holly would have to use the gripper clamps.\\n\\n All shuttles are equipped with secondary landing gear. If the docking nodes fail, then four magnetic gripper clamps could be blasted from recessed grooves. These clamps will latch on to the metal underside of the landing-bay dock, reeling the shuttle into the airlock. The grippers also came in handy in unfamiliar environments, where the magnets would seek out trace elements and latch on like sucker slugs.\\n\\n \u0027OK, Julius,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Don\u0027t move a muscle.\u0027\\n\\n Root paled. Julius. Holly had called him Julius. That was not good.\\n\\n Ten seconds.\\n\\n Holly flicked down a small view screen. \u0027Release forward port docking clamp.\u0027\\n\\n A grating hum signalled the clamp\u0027s release.\\n\\n The commander\u0027s image appeared in the view screen. Even from here he looked worried. Holly centred a cross hair on his chest.\\n\\n \u0027Captain Short. Are you absolutely sure about this?\u0027\\n\\n Holly ignored her superior. \u0027Range fifteen metres. Magnets only.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Holly, maybe I could jump. I could make it. I\u0027m sure I could make it.\u0027\\n\\n Five seconds ...\\n\\n \u0027Fire port clamp.\u0027\\n\\n Six tiny charges ignited around the clamp\u0027s base, sending the metal disc rocketing from its socket, trailed by a length of retractable polymer cable.\\n\\n Root opened his mouth to swear, then the clamp crashed into his chest, driving every gasp of air from his body. Several somethings cracked.\\n\\n \u0027Reel it in,\u0027 spat Holly into the computer mike, simultaneously peeling across the chute. The commander was dragged behind like an extreme surfer.\\n\\n Zero seconds. The concussors blew, sending two thousand kilograms of rubble careering into the void. A drop in an ocean of magma.\\n\\n A minute later, the commander was strapped on a gurney in the Atlantean ambassador\u0027s sick bay. It hurt to breathe, but that wasn\u0027t going to stop him talking.\\n\\n \u0027Captain Short!\u0027 he rasped. \u0027What the hell were you thinking? I could have been killed.\u0027\\n\\n Butler ripped open Root\u0027s tunic to survey the damage. \u0027You could have been. Five more seconds and you were pulp. It\u0027s thanks to Holly that you are still alive.\u0027\\n\\n Holly set the auto-pilot to hover and grabbed a medi-pac from the first-aid box. She crumpled it between her fingers to activate the crystals. Another of Foaly\u0027s inventions. Ice packs infused with healing crystals. No substitute for magic, but better than a hug and a kiss.\\n\\n \u0027Where does it hurt?\u0027\\n\\n Root coughed. A bloody string splattered his uniform. \u0027The general bodily area. Coupla ribs gone.\u0027\\n\\n Holly chewed her lip. She was no doctor and healing was by no means an automatic business. Things could go wrong. Holly knew a vice-captain once who had broken a leg and passed out. He woke up with one foot pointing backwards. Not that Holly hadn\u0027t performed some tricky operations before. When Artemis wanted his mother\u0027s depression cured, she was in a different time zone. Holly had sent out a strong positive signal, with enough sparks in it to hang around for a few days. A sort of general pick-me-up. Anyone who even visited Fowl Manor for the following week should have gone away whistling.\\n\\n \u0027Holly,\u0027 groaned Root.\\n\\n \u0027O-OK,\u0027 she stammered. \u0027OK.\u0027\\n\\n She laid her hands on Root\u0027s chest, sending the magic scurrying down her fingers. \u0027Heal,\u0027 she breathed.\\n\\n The commander\u0027s eyes rolled back in his head. The magic was shutting him down for recuperation. Holly laid a medi-pac on the unconscious LEP officer\u0027s chest.\\n\\n \u0027Hold that,\u0027 she instructed Artemis. \u0027Ten minutes only. Otherwise there\u0027ll be tissue damage.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis applied pressure to the pack. His fingers were quickly submerged in a pool of blood. Suddenly the desire to pass a smart remark utterly deserted him. First physical exercise, then actual bodily harm. And now this. These past few days were turning out to be quite educational. He\u0027d almost prefer to be back in St Bartleby\u0027s.\\n\\n Holly returned quickly to the cockpit, panning the external cameras towards the supply tunnel.\\n\\n Butler squeezed into the co-pilot\u0027s chair. \u0027Well,\u0027 he asked. \u0027What\u0027ve we got?\u0027\\n\\n Holly grinned. And for a second her expression reminded the manservant of Artemis Fowl. \u0027We\u0027ve got a big hole.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good. Then let\u0027s go visit an old friend.\u0027\\n\\n Holly\u0027s thumbs hovered over the thrusters. \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said. \u0027Let\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n The Atlantean shuttle disappeared into the supply tunnel faster than a carrot down Foaly\u0027s gullet. And for those who don\u0027t know, that\u0027s pretty fast.\\n\\n \\n\\n THE CROWLEY HOTEL, BEVERLY HILLS, LOS ANGELES\\n\\n \\n\\n Mulch made it back to his hotel undetected. Of course, this time he didn\u0027t have to scale the walls. It would have been more of a challenge than Maggie V\u0027s building. The walls here were brick, very porous. His fingers would have leeched the moisture from the stone and lost their suction.\\n\\n No, this time Mulch used the main foyer. And why wouldn\u0027t he? As far as the doorman was concerned, he was Lance Digger, reclusive millionaire. Short, maybe. But short and rich.\\n\\n \u0027Evening, Art,\u0027 said Mulch, saluting the doorman on his way to the lift.\\n\\n Art peered over the marble-topped desk.\\n\\n \u0027Ah, Mister Digger, it\u0027s you,\u0027 he said, slightly puzzled. \u0027I thought I heard you passing below my sightline only moments ago.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nope,\u0027 said Mulch, grinning. \u0027First time tonight.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm. The night wind perhaps.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Maybe. You\u0027d think they\u0027d block up the holes in this building. All the rent I\u0027m paying.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You would indeed,\u0027 agreed Art. Always agree with the tenants, company policy.\\n\\n Inside the mirrored lift, Mulch used a telescopic pointer to push P for penthouse. For the first few months, he had jumped to reach the button, but that was undignified behaviour for a millionaire. And besides, he was certain that Art could hear the thumping from the security desk.\\n\\n The mirrored box rose silently, flickering past the floors towards the penthouse. Mulch resisted the urge to take the Academy Award out of his bag. Someone could board the lift. He contented himself with a long drink from a bottle of Irish spring water, the closest to fairy pure it was possible to get. As soon as he had stowed the Oscar he would run a cold bath and give his pores a drink. Otherwise he could wake up in the morning glued to the bed.\\n\\n Mulch\u0027s door was key-coded. A fourteen-number sequence. Nothing like a bit of paranoia to keep you out of prison. Even though the LEP believed that he was dead, Mulch could never quite shake the feeling that one day Julius Root would figure it all out and come looking for him.\\n\\n The apartment\u0027s decor was quite unusual, for a human dwelling. A lot of clay, crumbling rock and water features. More like the inside of a cave than an exclusive Beverly Hills residence.\\n\\n The northern wall appeared to be a single slab of black marble. Appeared to be. Closer inspection revealed a forty-inch flat-screen television, a DVD slot and a tinted glass pane. Mulch hefted a remote control bigger than his leg, popping the hidden cabinet with another complicated key code. Inside were three rows of Oscars. Mulch placed Maggie V\u0027s on a waiting velvet pad.\\n\\n He wiped an imaginary tear from the corner of his eye. \u0027I\u0027d like to thank the Academy,\u0027 giggled the dwarf.\\n\\n \u0027Very touching,\u0027 said a voice behind him.\\n\\n Mulch slammed the cabinet door shut, cracking the glass pane.\\n\\n There was a human youth beside the rockery. In his apartment! The boy\u0027s appearance was strange, even by Mud Man standards. He was abnormally pale, raven-haired, slender and dressed in a school uniform that looked as though it had been dragged across two continents.\\n\\n The hairs on Mulch\u0027s chin stiffened. This boy was trouble. Dwarf hair is never wrong.\\n\\n \u0027Your alarm was amusing,\u0027 continued the boy. \u0027It took me several seconds to bypass it.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch knew he was in trouble then. Human police don\u0027t break into people\u0027s apartments.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you, hu ... boy?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think the question here is, who are you? Are you reclusive millionaire Lance Digger? Are you the notorious Grouch? Or perhaps, as Foaly suspects, you are escaped convict Mulch Diggums?\u0027\\n\\n Mulch ran, the last vestiges of gas providing him with an extra burst of speed. He had no idea who this Mud Boy was, but if Foaly sent him, then he was a bounty hunter of one kind or another.\\n\\n The dwarf raced across the sunken lounge, making for his escape route. It was the reason he\u0027d chosen this building. In the early nineteen hundreds a wide-bore chimney had run the length of the multi- storey building. When a central-heating system had been installed in the fifties, the building contractor had simply packed the chute with dirt, topping it off with a seal of concrete. Mulch had smelled the vein of soil the second his estate agent had opened the front door. It had been a simple matter to uncover the old fireplace and chip away the concrete. Voila. Instant tunnel.\\n\\n Mulch unbuttoned his bum-flap on the run. The strange youth made no attempt to follow him. Why would he? There was nowhere to go.\\n\\n The dwarf spared a second for a parting shot. \u0027You\u0027ll never take me alive, human. Tell Foaly not to send a Mud Man to do a fairy\u0027s job.\u0027\\n\\n Oh dear, thought Artemis, rubbing his brow. Hollywood had a lot to answer for.\\n\\n Mulch tore a basket of dried flowers from the fireplace and dived right in. He unhinged his jaw and was quickly submerged in the century-old clay. It was not really to his taste. The minerals and nutrients had long since dried up. Instead, the soil was infused with a hundred years of burnt refuse and tobacco ash. But it was clay nevertheless, and this was what dwarfs were born to do. Mulch felt his anxiety melt away. There wasn\u0027t a creature alive that could catch him now. This was his domain.\\n\\n The dwarf descended rapidly, chewing his way through the storeys. More than one wall collapsed on his way past. Mulch had a feeling that he wouldn\u0027t be getting his deposit back, even if he had been around to collect it.\\n\\n In a little over a minute, Mulch had reached the basement car park. He rehinged, gave his rear-end a shake to dislodge any bubbles of gas, then tumbled through the grate. His specially adapted four-wheel drive was waiting for him. Fuelled up, blacked out and ready to go.\\n\\n \u0027Suckers,\u0027 gloated the dwarf, fishing the keys from a chain around his neck.\\n\\n Then Captain Holly Short materialized not a metre away. \u0027Suckers?\u0027 she said, powering up her buzz baton.\\n\\n Mulch considered his options. The basement floor was asphalt. Asphalt was death to dwarfs, sealed up their insides like glue. There appeared to be a man mountain blocking the basement ramp. Mulch had seen that one before in Fowl Manor. That meant the human upstairs must be the infamous Artemis Fowl. Captain Short was dead ahead looking none too merciful. Only one way to go. Back into the flue. Up a couple of storeys, and hide out in another apartment.\\n\\n Holly grinned. \u0027Go on, Mulch. I dare you.\u0027 And Mulch did, he turned, launching himself back into the chimney, expecting a sharp shock in the rear-end. He was not disappointed. How could Holly miss a target like that?\\n\\n \\n\\n CHUTE EII6, BELOW LOS ANGELES\\n\\n \\n\\n The Los Angeles shuttle port was sixteen miles south of the city, hidden beneath the holographic projection of a sand dune. Root was waiting for them in the shuttle. He had recovered just enough to crack a grin.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 he grunted, hauling himself off the gurney, a fresh medi-pac strapped across his ribs. \u0027If it isn\u0027t my favourite reprobate, back from the dead.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch helped himself to a jar of squid pate from the Atlantean ambassador\u0027s personal cooler.\\n\\n \u0027Why is it, Julius, that you never pay me a social visit? After all, I did save your career back in Ireland. If it hadn\u0027t been for me, you never would have known about Fowl\u0027s copy of the Book.\u0027\\n\\n When Root was fuming, as he was now, you could have toasted marshmallows on his cheeks.\\n\\n \u0027We had a deal, convict. You broke it. And now I\u0027m bringing you in.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch scooped dollops of pate from the jar with his stubby fingers.\\n\\n \u0027Could use a little beetle juice,\u0027 he commented.\\n\\n \u0027Enjoy it while you can, Diggums. Because your next meal is going to be pushed through a slot in a door.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf settled back in a padded chair. \u0027Comfortable.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought so,\u0027 agreed Artemis. \u0027Some form of liquid suspension. Expensive, I shouldn\u0027t wonder.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure beats prison shuttles,\u0027 agreed Mulch. \u0027I remember this one time they caught me selling a Van Gogh to aTexan. I was transported in a shuttle the size of a mouse hole. They had a troll in the next cubicle. Stank something awful.\u0027\\n\\n Holly grinned. \u0027That\u0027s what the troll said.\u0027\\n\\n Root knew he was being goaded, but he blew his top anyway. \u0027Listen to me, convict. I have not travelled all this way to listen to your war stories. So shut your trap before I shut it for you.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch was unimpressed by the outburst. \u0027Just out of interest, Julius, why have you travelled all this way? The great Commander Root commandeering an ambassador\u0027s shuttle just to apprehend little old me? I don\u0027t think so. So, what\u0027s going on? And what\u0027s with the Mud Men?\u0027 He nodded at Butler. \u0027Especially that one.\u0027\\n\\n The manservant grinned. \u0027Remember me, little man? Seems to me I owe you something.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch swallowed. He had crossed swords with Butler before. It hadn\u0027t ended well for the human. Mulch had vented a bowel full of dwarf gas directly at the manservant. Very embarrassing for a bodyguard of his status, not to mention painful.\\n\\n For the first time Root chortled, even though it stretched his ribs. \u0027OK, Mulch.You\u0027re right. Something is going on. Something important.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought so. And, as usual, you need me to do your dirty work.\u0027 Mulch rubbed his rump. \u0027Well, assaulting me isn\u0027t going to help. You didn\u0027t have to buzz me so hard, Captain. That\u0027s going to leave a mark.\u0027\\n\\n Holly cupped a hand around one pointed ear. \u0027Hey, Mulch, if you listen really hard you can just about make out the sound of nobody giving a hoot. From what I saw, you were living pretty well on LEP gold.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That apartment cost me a fortune, you know. The deposit alone was four years of your salary. Did you see the view? Used to belong to some movie director.\u0027\\n\\n Holly raised an eyebrow. \u0027Glad to see the money was put to good use. Heaven forbid you should squander it.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch shrugged. \u0027Hey, I\u0027m a thief. What did you expect — I\u0027d start a shelter?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, Mulch, funnily enough I didn\u0027t expect that for one second.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis cleared his throat. \u0027This reunion is all very touching. But while you\u0027re exchanging witticisms, my father is freezing in the Arctic.\u0027\\n\\n The dwarf zipped up his suit. \u0027His father? You want me to rescue Artemis Fowl\u0027s father? In the Arctic?\u0027There was real fear in his voice. Dwarfs hated ice almost as much as fire.\\n\\n Root shook his head. \u0027I wish it were that simple, and in a few minutes so will you.\u0027\\n\\n Mulch\u0027s beard hairs curled in apprehension. And as his grandmother always said, trust the hair, Mulch, trust the hair.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/254.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
