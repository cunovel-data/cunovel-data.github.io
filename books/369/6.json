{"id":10735,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 7 Joining the Dots","content":"POLICE PLAZA ROOT pointed the finger of authority at Holly. \u0027Congratulations, Captain. You managed to lose some LEP technology.\u0027 Holly was ready for that one. \u0027Not strictly my fault, sir. The human was mesmerized and you ordered me not to leave the shuttle. I had no control over the situation.\u0027 \u0027Ten out of ten,\u0027 commented Foaly. \u0027Good answer. Anyway the Safetynet has a self-destruct, like everything I send into the field.\u0027 \u0027Quiet, civilian,\u0027 snapped the commander. But there was no venom in the LEP officer\u0027s rebuke. He was relieved; they all were. The human threat had been contained, and without the loss of a single life. They were gathered in a conference room reserved for civilian committees. Generally debriefings of this importance would be held in the Operations\u0027 Centre, but the LEP was not ready to show Artemis Fowl the nerve centre of its defences just yet. Root jabbed an intercom button on the desk. \u0027Trouble, are you out there?\u0027 \u0027Yessir.\u0027 \u0027OK. Now listen, I want you to stand down the alert. Send the teams into the deep tunnels, see if we can\u0027t root out a few goblin gangs. There are still plenty of loose ends: who\u0027s organizing the B\u0027wa Kell for one, and for what reason?\u0027 Artemis knew he shouldn\u0027t say anything. The sooner his side of the bargain was completed, the sooner he could be in the Arctic. But the entire Paris scenario seemed suspicious. \u0027Does anyone else think this is too neat? It\u0027s just what you all wanted to happen. Not to mention the fact that there could be more mesmerized humans up there.\u0027 Root did not appreciate being lectured by a Mud Boy. Especially this particular Mud Boy. \u0027Look, Fowl, you\u0027ve done what we asked. The Paris connection has been broken off. There won\u0027t be any more illegal shipments coming down that chute, I assure you. In fact, we have doubled security on all chutes, whether they\u0027re operational or not. The important thing is that whoever is trading with the humans hasn\u0027t told them about the People. There will, of course, be a major investigation, but that\u0027s an internal problem. So don\u0027t you worry your juvenile head about it. Concentrate on growing some bristles.\u0027 Foaly interrupted before Artemis could respond. \u0027About Russia,\u0027 he said, hurriedly placing his torso between Artemis and the commander. \u0027I\u0027ve got a lead.\u0027 \u0027You traced the e-mail?\u0027 said Artemis, his attention switching immediately to the centaur. \u0027Exactly,\u0027 confirmed Foaly, launching into lecture mode. \u0027But it\u0027s been spiked. Untraceable.\u0027 Foaly chuckled openly. \u0027Spiked? Don\u0027t make me laugh. You Mud Men and your communications systems. You\u0027re still using wires, for heaven\u0027s sake. If it\u0027s been sent, I can trace it.\u0027 \u0027So, where did you trace it to?\u0027 \u0027Every computer has a signature, as individual as a fingerprint,\u0027 continued Foaly. \u0027Networks too. They leave micro-traces, depending on the age of the wiring. Everything is molecular, and if you pack gigabytes of data into a little cable, some of that cable is going to wear off.\u0027 Butler was growing impatient. \u0027Listen, Foaly.Time is of the essence. Mister Fowl\u0027s life could hang in the balance. So get to the point before I start breaking things.\u0027 The centaur\u0027s first impulse was to laugh. Surely the human was joking? Then he remembered what Butler had done to Trouble Kelp\u0027s Retrieval squad, and decided to proceed directly to the point. \u0027Very well, Mud Man. Keep your hair on.\u0027 Well, almost directly to the point. \u0027I put the MPEG through my filters. Uranium residue points to northern Russia.\u0027 \u0027Now there\u0027s a shock.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not finished,\u0027 said Foaly. \u0027Watch and learn.\u0027 The centaur brought up a satellite photo of the Arctic Circle on the wall-screen. With every keystroke, the highlighted area shrank. \u0027Uranium means Severomorsk. Or somewhere within fifty miles. The copper wiring is from an old network. Early twentieth century, patched up over the years. The only match is Murmansk. As easy as joining the dots.\u0027 , Artemis sat forward in his chair. \u0027There are two hundred and eighty-four thousand landlines on that network.\u0027 Foaly had to stop for a laugh. \u0027Landlines. Barbarians.\u0027 Butler cracked his knuckles loudly. \u0027Ah, so two hundred and eighty-four thousand landlines. I wrote a program to search for hits on our MPEG. Two possible matches. One, the Hall of Justice.\u0027 \u0027Not likely. The other?\u0027 \u0027The other line is registered to a Mikhael Vassikin on Lenin Prospekt.\u0027 Artemis felt his stomach churn. \u0027And what do we know about Mikhael Vassikin?\u0027 Foaly wiggled his fingers like a concert pianist. \u0027I ran a search on my own intelligence files archives. I like to keep tabs on Mud People\u0027s so-called intelligence agencies. Quite a few mentions of you by the way, Butler.\u0027 The manservant tried to look innocent, but his facial muscles couldn\u0027t quite pull it off. \u0027Mikhael Vassikin is ex-KGB, now working for the Mafiya. The official term is khuligany. An enforcer. Not high level, but not street trash either. Vassikin\u0027s boss is a Murmansker known as Britva.The group\u0027s main source of income is the kidnapping of European businessmen. In the past five years they have abducted six Germans and a Swede.\u0027 \u0027How many were recovered alive?\u0027 asked Artemis, his voice a whisper. Foaly consulted his statistics. \u0027None,\u0027 he said. \u0027And in two cases, the negotiators went missing. Eight million dollars in lost ransom.\u0027 Butler struggled from a tiny fairy chair. \u0027Right, enough talk. I think it\u0027s time Mister Vassikin was introduced to my friend, Mister Fist.\u0027 Melodramatic, thought Artemis. But I couldn\u0027t have put it better myself. \u0027Yes, old friend. Soon enough. But I have no wish to add you to the list of lost negotiators. These men are smart. So we must be smarter. We have advantages that none of our predecessors had. We know who the kidnapper is, we know where he lives and, most importantly, we have fairy magic.\u0027 Artemis glanced at Commander Root. \u0027We do have fairy magic, don\u0027t we?\u0027 \u0027You have this fairy at any rate,\u0027 replied the commander. \u0027I won\u0027t force any of my people to go to Russia. But I could use some back-up.\u0027 He glanced at Holly. \u0027What do you think?\u0027 \u0027Of course I\u0027m coming,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027I\u0027m the best shuttle pilot you have.\u0027 KOBOI LABORATORIES There was a firing range in the Koboi Labs\u0027 basement. Opal had it constructed to her exact specifications. It incorporated her 3D projection system, was completely soundproof and was mounted on gyroscopes. You could drop an elephant from twenty metres in there and no seismograph under the world would detect so much as a shudder. The purpose of the firing range was to give the B\u0027wa Kell somewhere to practise with their Softnose lasers before the operation began in earnest. But it was Briar Cudgeon who had logged more hours on the simulators than anyone else. He seemed to spend every spare minute fighting virtual battles with his nemesis, Commander Julius Root. When Opal found him, he was pumping shells from his prized Softnose Redboy into a 3D holoscreen running one of Root\u0027s old training films. It was pathetic really; a fact she didn\u0027t bother mentioning. Cudgeon twisted out his earplugs. \u0027So. Who died?\u0027 Opal handed him a video pad. \u0027This just came in on the spy cameras. Carrere proved as inept as usual. Everyone survived but, as you predicted, Root has called off the alert. And now the commander has agreed to personally escort the humans to northern Russia, inside the Arctic Circle.\u0027 \u0027I know where northern Russia is,\u0027 Cudgeon snapped. He paused, stroking his bubbled forehead thoughtfully for several moments. \u0027This could turn out to our advantage. Now we have the perfect opportunity to eliminate the commander. With Julius out of the way, the LEP will be like a headless stink worm. Especially with their surface communications down. Their communications are down I take it?\u0027 \u0027Of course,\u0027 replied Opal. \u0027The jammer is linked into the chute sensors. All interference with surface transmitters will be blamed on the magma flares.\u0027 \u0027Perfect,\u0027 said Cudgeon, his mouth twitching in what could almost be described as glee. \u0027I want you to disable all LEP weaponry now. No need to give Julius any advantages.\u0027 When Koboi Laboratories had upgraded LEP weapons and transport, a tiny dot of solder had been included in each device. The solder was actually a mercury/glycerine solution that would detonate when a signal of the appropriate frequency was broadcast from the Koboi communications dish. LEP blasters would be useless, while the B\u0027wa Kell would be armed to the teeth with Softnose lasers. \u0027Consider it done,\u0027 said Opal. \u0027Are you certain Root won\u0027t be returning? He could upset our entire plan.\u0027 Cudgeon polished the Redboy on the leg of his uniform. \u0027Don\u0027t fret, my dear. Julius won\u0027t be coming back. Now that I know where he\u0027s going, I\u0027ll arrange for a little welcome party. I\u0027m certain our scaly friends will be only too eager to oblige.\u0027 The funny thing was that Briar Cudgeon didn\u0027t even like goblins. In fact, he detested them. They made his skin crawl with their reptilian ways. Their gas-burner breath, their lidless eyes and their constantly darting forked tongues. But they did supply a certain something that Cudgeon needed: dumb muscle. For centuries, the B\u0027wa Kell triad had skulked around Haven\u0027s borders, vandalizing what they couldn\u0027t steal and fleecing any tourists stupid enough to stray off the beaten path. But they were never really any threat to society. Whenever they got too cheeky, Commander Root would send a team into the tunnels to flush out the culprits. One evening, a disguised Briar Cudgeon strolled into The Second Skin, a notorious B\u0027wa Kell hang-out, plonked an attache case of gold ingots on the bar and said, \u0027I want to talk to the triad.\u0027 Cudgeon was searched and blindfolded by several of the club\u0027s bouncers. When the tape came off his face, he was in a damp warehouse, walls lined with creeping moss. Three elderly goblins were seated across the table from him. He recognized them from their mugshots. Scalene, Sputa and Phlebum.The triad old guard. The gift of gold, and the promise of more, were enough to pique their curiosity. His first utterance was carefully planned. \u0027Ah, Generals, I am honoured you greet me in person.\u0027 The goblins puffed out their wrinkled old chests proudly. Generals? The rest of Cudgeon\u0027s patter was equally smooth. He could \u0027help\u0027 organize the B\u0027wa Kell, streamline it and, most importantly, arm it. Then, when the time was right, they would rise up and overthrow the Council and their lackeys, the LEP. Cudgeon promised that his first act as Governor General would be to free all the goblin prisoners in Howler\u0027s Peak. It didn\u0027t hurt that he subtly laced his speech with hints of the hypnotic mesmer. It was an offer the goblins could not refuse. Gold, weapons, freedom for their brothers and, of course, a chance to crush the hated LEP. It never occurred to the B\u0027wa Kell that Cudgeon could betray them just as easily as he had the LEP. They were as dumb as stink worms and twice as short-sighted. Cudgeon met with General Scalene in a secret chamber beneath the Koboi Labs. He was in a foul mood following Luc\u0027s failure to put a scratch on any of his enemies. But there was always Plan B ... The B\u0027wa Kell was always eager to kill someone. It didn\u0027t really matter who. The goblin was excited, thirsty for blood. He panted blue flames like a broken heater. \u0027When do we go to war, Cudgeon? Tell us when?\u0027 The elf kept his distance. He dreamed of the day when these stupid creatures would no longer be necessary. \u0027Soon, General Scalene. Very soon. But first I need a favour. It concerns Commander Root.\u0027 The goblin\u0027s yellow eyes narrowed. \u0027Root? The hated one. Can we kill him? Can we crack his skull and fry his brains?\u0027 Cudgeon smiled magnanimously. \u0027Certainly, General. All of these things. Once Root is dead, the city will fall easily.\u0027 The goblin was bobbing now, jiggling with excitement. \u0027Where is he? Where is Root?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Cudgeon admitted. \u0027But I know where he will be in six hours.\u0027 \u0027Where?Tell me, elf!\u0027 Cudgeon heaved a large case on to the table. It contained four pairs of Koboi DoubleDex. \u0027Chute 93. Take these, send your best hit squad. And tell them to wrap up warm.\u0027 CHUTE E93 Julius Root always travelled in style. In this instance, he had commandeered the Atlantean ambassador\u0027s shuttle. All leather and gold. Seats softer than a gnome\u0027s behind, and drag buffers that negated all but the most serious jolts. Needless to say, the Atlantean ambassador hadn\u0027t been all that thrilled about handing over the starter chip. But it was difficult to refuse the commander when his fingers were drumming a tattoo on the tri-barrelled blaster strapped to his hip. So now the humans and their two elfin chaperones were climbing E93 in some considerable comfort. Artemis helped himself to a still water from the chiller cabinet. \u0027This tastes unusual,\u0027 he commented. \u0027Not unpleasant, but different.\u0027 \u0027Clean is the word you\u0027re searching for,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t believe how many filters we have to put it through to purge the Mud People from it.\u0027 \u0027No bickering, Captain Short,\u0027 warned Root. \u0027We\u0027re on the same side now. I want a smooth mission. Now suit up, all of you. We won\u0027t last five minutes out there without protection.\u0027 Holly cracked open an overhead locker. \u0027Fowl, front and centre.\u0027 Artemis complied, a bemused smile twitching at his lips. Holly pulled several cubic packages from the locker. \u0027What are you, about a six?\u0027 Artemis shrugged. He wasn\u0027t familiar with the People\u0027s system of measurement. \u0027What? Artemis Fowl doesn\u0027t know? I thought you were the world\u0027s expert on the People. It was you who stole our Book last year, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 Artemis unwrapped the package. It was a suit of some ultra-light rubber polymer. \u0027Anti-radiation,\u0027 explained Holly. \u0027Your cells will thank me in fifty years, if you\u0027re still around.\u0027 Artemis pulled the suit over his clothes. It shrank to fit like a second skin. \u0027Clever material.\u0027 \u0027Memory latex. Moulds itself to your shape, within reason. One use only unfortunately. Wear it and recycle it.\u0027 Butler clinked over. He was carrying so much fairy weaponry that Foaly had supplied him with a Moonbelt. The belt reduced the effective weight of its attachments to one fifth of the Earth norm. \u0027What about me?\u0027 asked Butler, nodding at the rad suits. Holly frowned. \u0027We don\u0027t have anything that big. Latex can only go so far.\u0027 \u0027Forget it. I\u0027ve been in Russia before. It didn\u0027t kill me.\u0027 \u0027Not yet it hasn\u0027t. Give it time.\u0027 Butler shrugged. \u0027What choice do I have?\u0027 Holly smiled, and there was a nasty twist to it. \u0027Oh, I didn\u0027t say there wasn\u0027t a choice.\u0027 She reached into the locker, pulling out a large pump \u0027n\u0027 spray can. And, for some reason, that little can scared Butler more than a bunker full of missiles. \u0027Now, hold still,\u0027 she said, aiming a gramophone-type nozzle at the bodyguard. \u0027This may stink worse than a hermit dwarf, but at least your skin won\u0027t glow in the dark.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/250.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
