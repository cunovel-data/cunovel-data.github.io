{"id":10736,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 8 To Russia with Gloves","content":"LENIN PROSPEKT, MIRMANSK MIKHAEL Vassikin was growing impatient. For over two years now he\u0027d been on babysitting duty. At Britva\u0027s request. Not that it had actually been a request. The term request implied that you had a choice in the matter.You did not argue with Britva.You did not even protest quietly. The Menidzher, or manager, was from the old school where his word was law. Britva\u0027s instructions had been simple: feed him, wash him and, if he doesn\u0027t come out of the coma in another year, kill him and dump the body in the Kola. Two weeks before the deadline, the Irishman had bolted upright in his bed. He awoke screaming a name. That name was Angeline. Kamar got such a shock, he\u0027d dropped the bottle of wine he\u0027d been opening. The bottle smashed, piercing his Ferruci loafers and cracking a big toenail.Toenails grow back, but Ferruci loafers were hard to come by in the Arctic Circle. Mikhael had been forced to sit on his partner to stop him killing the hostage. So now they were playing the waiting game. Kidnapping was an established business and there were rules. First you sent the teaser note, or in this case the e-mail. Wait a few days to give the pigeon a chance to put some funds together, then hit him with the ransom demand. They were locked in Mikhael\u0027s apartment on Lenin Prospekt, waiting for the call from Britva. They didn\u0027t even dare to go out for air. Not that there was much to see. Murmansk was one of those Russian cities that had been poured directly from a concrete mould. The only time Lenin Prospekt looked good was when it was buried in snow. Kamar emerged from the bedroom. His sharp features were stretched in disbelief. \u0027He wants caviar, can you believe it? I give him a nice bowl of stroganina and he wants caviar, the ungrateful Irlanskii.\u0027 Mikhael rolled his eyes. \u0027I liked him better asleep.\u0027 Kamar nodded, spitting into the fireplace. \u0027The sheets are too rough, he says. He\u0027s lucky I don\u0027t wrap him in a sack and roll him into the bay —\u0027 The phone rang, interrupting his empty threats. \u0027This is it, my friend,\u0027Vassikin said, clapping Kamar on the shoulder. \u0027We are on our way.\u0027 Vassikin picked up the phone. \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s me,\u0027 said a voice, made tinny by old wiring. \u0027Mister Brit -\u0027 \u0027Shut up, idiot! Never use my name!\u0027 Mikhael swallowed. The Menidzher didn\u0027t like to be connected to his various businesses. That meant no paperwork and no mention of his name if it could be recorded. It was his custom to make calls while driving around the city so that his location could not be triangulated. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, boss.\u0027 \u0027You should be,\u0027 continued the Mafiya kingpin. \u0027Now listen, and don\u0027t talk. You have nothing to contribute.\u0027 Vassikin covered the handset. \u0027Everything\u0027s fine,\u0027 he whispered, giving Kamar the thumbs up. \u0027We\u0027re doing a great job.\u0027 \u0027The Fowls are a clever outfit,\u0027 continued Britva. \u0027And I have no doubt they are concentrating on tracing the last e-mail.\u0027 \u0027But I spiked the last -\u0027 \u0027What did I tell you?\u0027 \u0027You said not to talk, Mister Brit ... sir.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right. So send the ransom message and then move Fowl to the drop point.\u0027 Mikhael paled. \u0027The drop point?\u0027 \u0027Yes, the drop point. No one will be looking for you there, I guarantee it.\u0027 \u0027But -\u0027 \u0027Again with the talking! Get yourself a spine, man. It\u0027s only for a couple of days. So, you might lose a year off your life. It won\u0027t kill you.\u0027 Vassikin\u0027s brain churned, searching for an excuse. Nothing came. \u0027OK, boss. Whatever you say.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right. Now listen to me. This is your big chance. Do this right and you move up a couple of steps in the organization.\u0027 Vassikin grinned. A life of champagne and expensive cars beckoned. \u0027If this man really is young Fowl\u0027s father, the boy will pay up. When you get the money, dump them both in the Kola. I don\u0027t want any survivors to start a vendetta. Call me if there\u0027s any trouble.\u0027 \u0027OK, boss.\u0027 \u0027Oh, and one more thing.\u0027 \u0027Yes?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t call me.\u0027 The line went dead. Vassikin was left staring at the handset as though it were a handful of plague virus. \u0027Well?\u0027 asked Kamar. \u0027We are to send the second message.\u0027 A broad grin split Kamar\u0027s face. \u0027Excellent. At last this thing is nearly over.\u0027 \u0027Then we are to move the package to the drop zone.\u0027 The broad grin disappeared like a fox down a hole. \u0027What? Now?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Now.\u0027 Kamar paced the tiny living room. \u0027That is crazy. Completely insane. Fowl cannot be here for a couple of days at the earliest. There\u0027s no need for us to spend two days breathing in that poison. What is the reasoning?\u0027 Mikhael extended the phone. \u0027You tell him. I\u0027m sure the Menidzher will appreciate being told he is a madman.\u0027 Kamar sank on to the threadbare sofa, dropping his head into his hands. \u0027Will this thing never end?\u0027 His partner fired up their ancient sixteen-megabyte hard drive. \u0027I don\u0027t know for certain,\u0027 he said, sending the pre-prepared message. \u0027But I do know what will happen if we don\u0027t do what Britva says.\u0027 Kamar sighed. \u0027I think I\u0027ll go shout at the prisoner for a while.\u0027 \u0027Will that help?\u0027 \u0027It won\u0027t,\u0027 admitted Kamar. \u0027But it will make me feel better.\u0027 E93, ARCTIC SHUTTLE PORT The Arctic Station had never been high on the fairy tourist list. Sure, icebergs and polar bears were pretty, but nothing was worth saturating your lungs with irradiated air for. Holly docked the shuttle in the only serviceable bay. The terminal itself resembled nothing more than a deserted warehouse. Static conveyer belts snaked along the floor and low-level heating pipes rattled with insect life. Holly handed out human overcoats and gloves from an ancient locker. \u0027Wrap up, Mud Boys. It\u0027s cold outside.\u0027 Artemis did not need to be told. The terminal\u0027s solar batteries had long since shut down, and the ice\u0027s grip had cracked the walls like a nut in a vice. Holly tossed Butler his coat from a distance. \u0027You know something, Butler? You stink!\u0027 she said, laughing. The manservant growled. \u0027You and your radiation gel. I think my skin\u0027s changed colour.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t worry about it. Fifty years and it\u0027ll wash right off: Butler buttoned a Cossack greatcoat up to his neck. \u0027I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re getting all wrapped up.You\u0027ve got the fancy suits.\u0027 \u0027The coats are camouflage,\u0027 explained Holly, smearing rad gel on her face and neck. \u0027If we shield, the vibration makes the suits useless. Might as well dip your bones in a reactor core. So for tonight only, we\u0027re all humans.\u0027 Artemis frowned. If the fairies couldn\u0027t shield, it would make rescuing his father all the more difficult. His evolving plan would have to be adjusted. \u0027Less of the chat,\u0027 growled Root, pulling a bearskin hat over his pointed ears. \u0027We move out in five. I want everybody armed and dangerous. Even you, Fowl, if your little wrists can support a weapon.\u0027 Artemis selected a fairy handgun from the shuttle\u0027s arsenal. He jacked the battery into its slot, flicking the setting up to three. \u0027Don\u0027t worry about me, Commander. I\u0027ve been practising. We have quite a stash of LEP weaponry at the manor.\u0027 Root\u0027s complexion cranked up one more notch. \u0027Well, there\u0027s a big difference between stunning a cardboard cutout and a real person.\u0027 Artemis gave his vampire smile. \u0027If everything proceeds according to plan, there will be no need for weapons. The first stage is simplicity itself: we set up a surveillance post near Vassikin\u0027s apartment. When the opportunity arises, Butler will snatch our Russian friend and the five of us can have a little chat. I\u0027m sure that he will tell us everything we need to know under the influence of your mesmer. Then, it will be a simple matter to stun any guards and rescue my father.\u0027 Root pulled a heavy scarf over his mouth. \u0027And what if things don\u0027t go according to plan?\u0027 Artemis\u0027s eyes were cold and determined. \u0027Then, Commander, we will have to improvise.\u0027 Holly felt a shiver rattle around her stomach. And it had nothing to do with the climate. * The terminal was buried twenty metres below an ice pack. They took the courtesy elevator to the surface, and the party emerged into the Arctic night looking for all the world like an adult and three children. Albeit three children with inhuman weaponry clanking under every loose fold of cloth. Holly checked the GPS locator on her wrist. \u0027We\u0027re in the Rosta district, Commander. Twenty klicks north of Murmansk.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s Foaly got on the weather? I don\u0027t want to be caught in the middle of a blizzard miles from our destination.\u0027 \u0027No luck. I can\u0027t get a line. Magma flares must still be up\u0027 \u0027D\u0027Arvit!\u0027 swore Root. \u0027Well, I suppose we\u0027ll have to take our chances on foot. Butler, you\u0027re the expert here, you take point. Captain Short, bring up the rear. Feel free to boot any human backside if it lags behind.\u0027 Holly winked at Artemis. \u0027No need to tell me twice, sir.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll bet there isn\u0027t,\u0027 grunted Root, with only the barest hint of a smile playing about his lips. The motley band trudged south-east by moonlight until they reached the railway line. Walking along the sleepers was the one place they could be safe from drifts and suck holes. Progress was slow. A northerly wind snaked through every pore in their clothing, and the cold attacked any exposed skin like a million electric darts. There was little conversation. The Arctic had that effect on people, even if three of them were wearing coil-heated suits. Holly broke the silence. Something had been nagging at her for a while. \u0027Tell me something, Fowl,\u0027 she said from behind him. \u0027Your father. Is he like you?\u0027 Artemis\u0027s step faltered for an instant. \u0027That\u0027s a strange question. Why do you ask?\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027re no friend to the People. What if the man we\u0027re trying to rescue is the man who will destroy us?\u0027 There was a long silence, broken only by the chattering of teeth. Holly saw Artemis\u0027s chin drop on to his chest. \u0027You have no cause to be alarmed, Captain. My father, though some of his ventures were undoubtedly illegal, was ... is ... a noble man. The idea of harming another creature would be repugnant to him.\u0027 Holly tugged her boot from twenty centimetres of snow. \u0027So, what happened to you?\u0027 Artemis\u0027s breath came over his shoulder in icy sheets. \u0027I ... I made a mistake.\u0027 Holly squinted at the back of the human\u0027s head. Was this actual sincerity from Artemis Fowl? It was hard to believe. Even more surprising was the fact that she didn\u0027t know how to react. Whether to extend the hand of forgiveness, or the boot of retribution. Eventually, she decided to reserve judgement. For the moment. They passed into a ravine, worn smooth by the whistling wind. Butler didn\u0027t like it. His soldier\u0027s sense was beating a tattoo on the inside of his skull. He raised a clenched fist. Root double-timed until he caught up. \u0027Trouble?\u0027 Butler squinted into the snow field, searching for footprints. \u0027Maybe. Nice spot for a surprise attack.\u0027 \u0027Maybe. If anyone knew we were coming.\u0027 \u0027Is that possible? Could someone know?\u0027 Root snorted, breath forming clouds in the air before him. \u0027Impossible. The chute is totally isolated, and LEP security is the tightest on the planet.\u0027 And that was when the goblin hit squad soared over the ridge. Butler grabbed Artemis by the collar, unceremoniously flinging him into a drift. His other hand was already drawing his weapon. \u0027Keep your head down, Artemis. Time for me to earn my salary.\u0027 Artemis would have responded testily had his head not been under a metre of snow. There were four goblins flying in loose formation, dark against the starlit sky. They quickly rose to three hundred metres, making no attempt to conceal their presence. They neither attacked nor fled, simply hovered overhead. \u0027Goblins,\u0027 grunted Root, pulling a Far shoot neutrino rifle into his shoulder. \u0027Too stupid to live. All they had to do was pick us off.\u0027 Butler picked a spot, spreading his legs for steadiness. \u0027Do we wait until we see the whites of their eyes, Commander?\u0027 \u0027Goblin eyes don\u0027t have whites,\u0027 responded Root. \u0027But even so, holster your weapon. Captain Short and I will stun them. No need for anyone to die.\u0027 Butler slid the Sig Sauer into its pouch beneath his arm. It was next to useless at that range anyway. It would be interesting to see howr Holly and Root handled themselves in a firefight. After all, Artemis\u0027s life was pretty much in their hands. Not to mention his own. Butler glanced sideways. Holly and the commander were pumping the triggers of various weapons. Without any result. Their weapons were as dead as mice in a snake pit. \u0027I don\u0027t understand it,\u0027 muttered Root. \u0027I checked these myself.\u0027 Artemis, naturally, was first to figure it out. He shook the snow from his hair. \u0027Sabotage,\u0027 he proclaimed, tossing aside the useless fairy handgun. \u0027There is no other alternative. This is why the B\u0027wa Kell needs Softnose weapons, because it has somehow disabled fairy lasers.\u0027 But the commander was not listening, and neither was Butler. This was no time for clever deductions; this was a time for action. They were sitting ducks out here, dark against the pale Arctic glow. This theory was confirmed when several Softnose laser bursts bored hissing holes in the snow at their feet. Holly activated her helmet Optix, zooming in on the enemy. \u0027It looks like one of them has a Softnose laser, sir. Something with a long barrel.\u0027 \u0027We need cover. Fast!\u0027 Butler nodded. \u0027Look. An overhang. Under the ridge.\u0027 The manservant grabbed his charge by the collar, hoisting him aloft as easily as a child would lift a kitten.They struggled through the snow to the shelter of the overhang. Maybe a million years ago the ice had melted sufficiently for a layer to slump slightly, then freeze up again. The resulting wrinkle had somehow lasted through the ages and could now possibly save their lives. They dived underneath the lip, wriggling backwards against a wall of ice. The frozen canopy was easily thick enough to withstand gunfire from any conventional weapon. Butler shielded Artemis with his body, risking an upward glance. \u0027Too far. I can\u0027t make them out. Holly?\u0027 Captain Short poked her head from under the frozen ledge and her Optix zoomed into focus. \u0027Well, what are they up to?\u0027 Holly waited a beat, until the figures sharpened. \u0027Funny thing,\u0027 she commented. \u0027They\u0027re all firing now, but...\u0027 \u0027But what, Captain?\u0027 Holly tapped her helmet to make sure the lenses were working. \u0027Maybe I\u0027m getting some Optix distortion, sir, but it looks like they\u0027re missing on purpose, shooting way over our heads.\u0027 Butler felt the blood pounding in his brain. \u0027It\u0027s a trap!\u0027 he roared, reaching behind him to grab Artemis. \u0027Everybody out! Everybody out!\u0027 And that was when the goblin charges sent fifty tonnes of rock, ice and snow tumbling to the ground. They nearly made it. Of course, nearly never won a bucket of squid at gnommish roulette. If it hadn\u0027t been for Butler, not one of the group would have survived. Something happened to him. An inexplicable surge of strength, not unlike the energy bursts that allow mothers to lift fallen trees off their children. The manservant grabbed Artemis and Holly, spinning them forward like stones across a pond. It wasn\u0027t a very dignified way to travel, but it certainly beat having your bones pulverized by falling ice. For the second time in so many minutes, Artemis landed nose first in a snowdrift. Behind him, Butler and Root were scrabbling from beneath the ledge, boots slipping on the icy surface. The air was rent by avalanche thunder, and the pack ice beneath them heaved and split. Thick chunks of rock and ice speared the cave\u0027s opening like bars. Butler and Root were trapped. Holly was on her feet, racing towards her commander. But what could she do? Throw herself back underneath the ledge? \u0027Stay back, Captain,\u0027 said Root into his helmet mike. \u0027That\u0027s an order!\u0027 \u0027Commander,\u0027 Holly breathed. \u0027You\u0027re alive.\u0027 \u0027Somehow,\u0027 came the reply. \u0027Butler is unconscious and we\u0027re pinned down. The ledge is on the point of collapsing. The only thing holding it up is the debris. If we brush that aside to get out ...\" They were alive then at least. Trapped, but alive. A plan, they needed a plan. Holly found herself strangely calm. This was one of the qualities that made her such an excellent field agent. In times of excessive stress, Captain Short had the ability to target a course of action. Often the only viable course. In the combat simulator for her captain\u0027s exam, Holly had defeated insurmountable virtual enemies by blasting the projector. Technically, she had defeated all her enemies, so the panel had to pass her. Holly spoke into her helmet mike. \u0027Commander, undo Butler\u0027s Moonbelt and strap yourselves on. I\u0027m going to haul you both out of there.\u0027 \u0027Roger, Holly. Do you need a piton?\u0027 \u0027If you can get one out to me.\u0027 \u0027 Standby.\u0027 A piton dart jetted through a gap in the icy bars, landing a metre from Holly\u0027s boots. The dart trailed a length of fine-grade cord. Holly snapped the piton into the cord receptacle on her own belt, making sure there were no kinks in the line. Meanwhile, Artemis had dragged himself from the drift. \u0027This plan is patently ridiculous,\u0027 he said, brushing the snow from his sleeves. \u0027You cannot hope to drag their combined weight with sufficient velocity to break the icicles and avoid being crushed.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not going to drag them,\u0027 snapped Holly. \u0027Well then, who is?\u0027 Captain Short pointed down the track. There was a green train winding its way towards them. \u0027That is,\u0027 she said. There were three goblins left. Their names were D\u0027Nall, Aymon and Nyle. Three rookies vying for the recently vacated lieutenant\u0027s spot. Lieutenant Poll had handed in his resignation when he\u0027d strayed too close to the avalanche and been swatted by a five-hundred-kilo pane of transparent ice. They hovered at three hundred metres, well out of range. Of course, they weren\u0027t out of fairy-weapon range, but LEP weapons weren\u0027t operational at the moment. Koboi Laboratories\u0027 upgrades had seen to that. \u0027That was some hole in Lieutenant Poll,\u0027 whistled Aymon. \u0027I could see right through \u0027im. An\u0027 I don\u0027t mean that like he was a bad liar.\u0027 Goblins didn\u0027t get too attached to each other. Considering the amount of backstabbing, backbiting and general vindictiveness that went on in the B\u0027wa Kell, it didn\u0027t pay to make any special friends. \u0027What you think?\u0027 asked D\u0027Nall, the handsome one, relatively speaking. \u0027Maybe one of you guys should take a spin down there.\u0027 Aymon snorted. \u0027Sure thing. We go down and get sparked by the big one. Just how dumb do you think we are?\u0027 \u0027The big one is out of the picture. I sparked him myself. Sweet shot.\u0027 \u0027My shot set off the avalanche,\u0027 objected Nyle, the baby of the gang. \u0027You\u0027re always claimin\u0027 my kills.\u0027 \u0027What kills?The only thing you ever killed was a stink worm. And that was an accident.\u0027 \u0027Rubbish,\u0027 sulked Nyle. \u0027I meant to kill that worm. He was buggin\u0027 me.\u0027 Aymon swooped between the two. \u0027All right. Keep your scales on, the pair of you. All we gotta do is throw a few rounds into the survivors from up here.\u0027 \u0027Nice plan, genius,\u0027 sneered D\u0027Nall. \u0027Except it won\u0027t work.\u0027 \u0027And why not?\u0027 D\u0027Nall pointed below with a manicured nail. \u0027Because they\u0027re boarding that train.\u0027 Four green carriages were winding in from the north, dragged along by an ancient diesel engine. A maelstrom of snow flurries coiled in its wake. Salvation, thought Holly. Or perhaps not. For some reason, the mere sight of the clanking locomotive set her stomach bubbling with acid. Still, she was in no position to be choosy. \u0027It\u0027s the Mayak Chemical train,\u0027 said Artemis. Holly glanced over her shoulder. Artemis seemed even paler than usual. \u0027The what?\u0027 \u0027Environmentalists worldwide call it the Green Machine, something of an irony. It transports spent uranium and plutonium assemblies to the Mayak Chemical Combine for recycling. One driver locked up in the engine. No guards. Fully loaded, this thing is hotter than a nuclear submarine.\u0027 \u0027And you know about this because Artemis shrugged. \u0027I like to keep track of these things. After all, radiation is the world\u0027s problem.\u0027 Holly could feel it now. Uranium tendrils eating through the rad gel on her cheeks. That train was poison. But it was her only chance of getting the commander out alive. \u0027This just keeps getting better and better,\u0027 Holly muttered. The train was closer. Obviously. Motoring along at about ten klicks an hour. No problem for Holly on her own, but with two men down and one next-to-useless Mud Boy, it was going to take quite a feat to get on board that locomotive. Holly spared a second to check on the goblins. They were holding steady at three hundred metres. Goblins were no good at improvisation. This train was unexpected; it would take them at least a minute to work out a new strategy. The big hole in their fallen comrade might give them further pause for thought. Holly could feel the radiation emanating from the carriages, burning through the tiniest gap in the radiation gel, prickling her eyeballs. It was only a matter of time before her magic ran out. After that, she was living on borrowed time. No time to think about it now. Her priority was the commander. She had to get him out of there alive. If the B\u0027wa Kell was brazen enough to mount an operation against the LEP, there was obviously something pretty big going on below ground. Whatever it was, Julius Root would be needed to spearhead the counterattack. She turned towards Artemis. \u0027OK, Mud Boy. We\u0027ve got one shot at this. Grab on to whatever you can.\u0027 Artemis couldn\u0027t hide an apprehensive shiver. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid, Artemis. You can make it.\u0027 Artemis bristled. \u0027It\u0027s cold, fairy. Humans shiver in the cold.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the spirit,\u0027 said the LEP captain, and she began to run. The piton wire played out behind her like a harpoon cable. Though it had the approximate grade of fishing line, the cable could easily suspend two struggling elephants. Artemis raced after her as fast as his loafered feet could manage. They ran parallel to the tracks, feet crunching through the snow. Behind them the train grew closer, pushing a buffer of air before it. Artemis struggled to keep up. This was not for him. Running and sweating. Combat, for heaven\u0027s sake. He was no soldier. He was a planner. A mastermind. The hurly-burly of actual conflict was best left to Butler and people like him. But his manservant wasn\u0027t there to take care of the physical tasks this time. And he never would be again if they didn\u0027t manage to board this train. Artemis\u0027s breath came short, crystallizing in front of his face, blurring his vision. The train had drawn level now, steel wheels spewing ice and sparks into the air. \u0027Second carriage,\u0027 panted Holly. \u0027There\u0027s a runner. Mind your footing.\u0027 Runner? Artemis glanced behind. The second carriage was coming up fast. But the noise was blurring his vision. Was that possible? It was terrific. Unbearable. There, below the steel doors. A narrow board. Wide enough to stand on. Barely. Holly alighted easily, flattening herself against the carriage wall. She made it look so effortless. A simple skip and she was safe from the grab of those pulverizing wheels. \u0027Come on, Fowl,\u0027 shouted Holly. \u0027Jump.\u0027 Artemis tried, he really did. But the toe of his loafer snagged on a sleeper. He stumbled forward, pin-wheeling for balance. A painful death came rushing up to meet him. Two left feet,\u0027 muttered Holly, grabbing her least favourite Mud Boy by the collar. Momentum swung Artemis forward, slamming him into the door like something out of a cartoon. The piton cord was slapping against the carriage. Only seconds left before Holly departed from the train as quickly as she\u0027d arrived. The LEP captain searched for a strongpoint to anchor herself. Root and Butler\u0027s weight may have been reduced by the Moonbelt, but the jerk when it came, would be more than sufficient to drag her from the locomotive. And if that happened, it was all over. Holly hooked one arm through a rung on the carriage\u0027s external ladder. She noticed magical sparks playing over a rip in her suit. They were counteracting the radiation damage. How much longer could her magic last under these conditions? Constant healing really took it out of a girl. She needed to complete the power-restoring Ritual. And the sooner the better. Holly was about to unclip the cable and attach it to one of the rungs when it snapped taut, pulling Holly\u0027s legs from beneath her. She held on to the rung grimly, fingernails digging into her own skin. On reflection, this plan needed a bit of work. Time seemed to stretch, elastic as the cord and, for a moment, Holly thought her elbow would pop right out of its socket. Then the ice gave and Root and Butler were twanged out of their icy tomb like a bolt from a crossbow. Seconds later, they slapped against the side of the train, their reduced weight keeping them aloft, for now. But it was only a matter of time before what little gravity they had pushed them under the steel wheels. Artemis latched on to the rung beside her. \u0027What can I do?\u0027 She nodded at a shoulder pocket. \u0027In there. A small vial. Take it out.\u0027 Artemis ripped open theVelcro flap, pulling out a tiny spray bottle. \u0027OK. Got it.\u0027 \u0027Good. It\u0027s up to you now, Fowl. Up and over.\u0027 Artemis\u0027s mouth dropped open. \u0027Up and ...?\u0027 \u0027Yes. It\u0027s our only hope. We have to get this door open to reel in Butler and the commander.There\u0027s a bend in the track two klicks away. If this train slows down even one revolution, they\u0027re gone.\u0027 Artemis nodded. \u0027The vial?\u0027 \u0027Acid. For the lock. The mechanism\u0027s on the inside. Cover your face and squeeze. Give it the whole tube. Don\u0027t get any on you.\u0027 It was a long conversation under the circumstances. Especially since every second was vital. Artemis did not waste another one on goodbyes. He dragged himself to the next rung, keeping the length of his body pressed close to the carriage. The wind was whipping along the length of the train, tiny motes of ice in every gust. They stung like bees. Nevertheless, Artemis pulled off his gloves with chattering teeth. Better frostbite than being crushed beneath the wheels. Upwards. One rung at a time, until his head poked above the carriage. Every shred of shelter was now gone. The air pounded his forehead, forcing itself down his throat. Artemis squinted through the blizzard, along the carriage\u0027s roof. There! In the centre. A skylight. Across a desert of steel, blasted smooth as glass by the elements. Not a handhold within five metres. The strength of a rhino would be of no use here, Artemis decided. At last an opportunity to use his brain. Kinetics and momentum. Simple enough, in theory. Keeping to the front rim of the carriage, Artemis inched on to the roof.The wind wormed beneath his legs, raising them five centimetres from the deck, threatening to float him off the train. Artemis curled his fingers around the rim. These were not gripping fingers. Artemis hadn\u0027t gripped anything bigger than his mobile phone in several months. If you wanted someone to type Paradise Lost in under twenty minutes, then Artemis was your man. But as for hanging on to carriage roofs in a blizzard. Dead loss. Which, fortunately, was all part of the plan. A millisecond before his finger joints parted company, Artemis let go. The slipstream shot him straight through the skylight\u0027s metal housing. Perfect, he would have grunted, had there been a cubic centimetre of air in his lungs. But even if he had said it, the wind would have snatched away any words before his own ears heard them. He had moments now before the wind dug its fingers beneath his torso, flipping him on to the icy steppes. Cannon fodder for the goblins. Artemis fumbled the acid vial from his pocket, snapping the top between his teeth. A fleck of the acid flew past his eye. No time to worry about that now. No time for anything. The skylight was secured by a thick padlock. Artemis dribbled two drops into the keyhole. All he could spare. It would have to be enough. The effect was immediate. The acid ate through the metal like lava through ice. Fairy technology. Best under -the world. The padlock pinged open, exposing the hatch to the wind\u0027s power. It flipped upwards and Artemis tumbled through on to a pallet of barrels. Not exactly the picture of a gallant rescuer. The train\u0027s motion shook him from the cargo. Artemis landed face up, gazing at the triple-triangled symbol for radiation stamped on the side of each container. At least the barrels were sealed, though rust seemed to have taken hold on quite a few. Artemis rolled across the slatted floor, clambering to his knees alongside the door. Was Captain Short still anchored there, or was he alone now? For the first time in his life. Truly alone. \u0027Fowl! Open the door, you pasty-faced Mud Weasel!\u0027 Ah well. Not alone then. Covering his face with a forearm, Artemis drenched the carriage\u0027s triple bolt with fairy acid. The steel lock melted instantly, dripping to the floor like a stream of mercury. Artemis dragged the sliding door back. Holly was hanging on grimly, her face steaming where radiation was eating through the gel. Artemis grabbed her waistband. \u0027On three?\u0027 Holly nodded. No more energy for speech. Artemis flexed his digits. Fingers, don\u0027t fail me now. If he ever got out of this, he would buy one of those ridiculous home gymnasiums advertised on the shopping channels. \u0027One.\u0027 The bend was coming. He could see it out of the corner of his eye. The train would slow down or derail itself. \u0027Two.\u0027 Captain Short\u0027s strength was almost spent. The wind rippled her frame like a windsock. \u0027Three!\u0027 Artemis pulled with all the strength in his thin arms. Holly closed her eyes and let go, unable to believe she was trusting her life to this Mud Boy. Artemis knew a little something about physics. He timed his count to take advantage of swing, momentum and the train\u0027s own forward motion. But nature always throws something into the mix that can\u0027t be anticipated. In this case the something was a slight gap between two sections of the track. Not enough to derail a locomotive, but certainly enough to cause a bump. This bump sent the carriage door crashing into its frame like a five-tonne guillotine. But it looked like Holly had made it. Artemis couldn\u0027t really tell because she had crashed into him, sending them both careering into the wooden siding. She seemed to be intact, from what he could see. At least her head was still attached to her neck, which was good. But she did seem to be unconscious. Probably trauma. Artemis knew that he was going to pass out too. He could tell by the darkness eating at the corners of his vision, like some malignant computer virus. He slipped sideways, landing on Holly\u0027s chest. This had more severe repercussions than you might think. Because Holly was unconscious, her magic was on autopilot. And unsupervised magic flows like electricity. Artemis\u0027s face made contact with the fairy\u0027s left hand, diverting the flow of blue sparks. And while this was good for him, it was most definitely bad for her. Because although Artemis didn\u0027t know it, Holly needed every spark of magic she could muster — not all of her had made it inside the train. Commander Root had just activated his piton cord winch when he received a most unexpected poke in the eye. The goblin D\u0027Nall removed a small rectangular mirror from his tunic and checked his scales were smooth. \u0027These Koboi wings are great. You think we\u0027ll be allowed to keep \u0027em?\u0027 Aymon scowled. Not that you\u0027d notice. Goblin lizard ancestry meant that facial movement was pretty limited. \u0027Quiet, you hot-blooded fool!\u0027 Hot-blooded. That was a pretty serious insult for one of the B\u0027waKell. D\u0027Nall bristled. \u0027Be careful, friend, or I\u0027ll tear that forked tongue right out of your head.\u0027 \u0027We won\u0027t have a tongue between us if those elves escape!\u0027 retorted Aymon. It was true. The generals did not take disappointment well. \u0027So what do we do? I got the looks in this outfit. That must make you the brains.\u0027 \u0027We shoot at the train,\u0027 interjected Nyle. \u0027Simple.\u0027 D\u0027Nall adjusted his Koboi DoubleDex, hovering across to the squad\u0027s junior member. \u0027Idiot,\u0027 he snapped, administering a swift slap to the head. \u0027That thing is radioactive, can\u0027t you smell it? One stray burst and we\u0027ll all be ash floating on the breeze.\u0027 \u0027Good point,\u0027 admitted Nyle. \u0027You\u0027re not as stupid as you look.\u0027 \u0027Thank you.\u0027 \u0027Welcome.\u0027 Aymon throttled down, descending to a hundred and fifty metres. It was so tempting. One tightly focused burst to take out the elf clinging to the carriage, another to dispatch the human on the roof. But he couldn\u0027t risk it. One degree off target and he\u0027d sucked his last stink-worm spaghetti. \u0027OK,\u0027 he announced into his helmet mike. \u0027Here\u0027s the plan. With all the radiation in that carriage, chances are the targets will be dead in minutes. We follow the train for a while just to make sure. Then we go back and tell the general we saw the bodies.\u0027 D\u0027Nall buzzed down beside him. \u0027And do we see the bodies?\u0027 Aymon groaned. \u0027Of course not, you fool! Do you want your eyeballs to dry up and fall out?\u0027 \u0027Duh; \u0027Exactly. So are we clear?\u0027 \u0027Crystal,\u0027 said Nyle, drawing his Softnose Redboy handgun. He shot his comrades from behind. Close range, point blank. They never had a chance. He followed their bodies to Earth on full magnification. The snow would cover them in minutes. Nobody would be stumbling over those particular corpses until the polar caps melted. Nyle bolstered his weapon, punching in the coordinates for the shuttle terminal on his flight computer. If you studied his reptilian face carefully, it was just possible to make out a grin.There was a new lieutenant in town.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/251.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
