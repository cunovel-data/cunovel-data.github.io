{"id":10730,"no":1,"title":"Prologue","content":"THE two Russians huddled around a flaming barrel in a futile attempt to ward off the Arctic chill. The Bay of Kola was not a place you wanted to be after September, especially not Murmansk. In Murmansk even the polar bears wore scarves. Nowhere was colder, except perhaps Noril\u0027sk. The men were Mafiya enforcers and were more used to spending their evenings inside stolen BMWs. The larger of the two, Mikhael Vassikin, checked the fake Rolex beneath the sleeve of his fur coat. \u0027This thing could freeze up,\u0027 he said, tapping the diving bezel. \u0027What am I going to do with it then?\u0027 \u0027Stop your complaining,\u0027 said the one called Kamar. \u0027It\u0027s your fault we\u0027re stuck outside in the first place.\u0027 Vassikin paused. \u0027Pardon me?\u0027 \u0027Our orders were simple: sink the Fowl Star. All you had to do was blow the cargo bay. It was a big enough ship, heaven knows. Blow the cargo bay and down she goes. But no, the great Vassikin hits the stern. Not even a back-up rocket to finish the job. So now we have to search for survivors.\u0027 \u0027She sank, didn\u0027t she?\u0027 Kamar shrugged. \u0027So what? She sank slowly, plenty of time for the passengers to grab on to something. Vassikin, the famous sharpshooter! My grandmother could shoot better.\u0027 Lyubkhin, the Mafiya\u0027s man on the docks, approached before the discussion could develop into an all-out brawl. \u0027How are things?\u0027 asked the bear-like Yakut. Vassikin spat over the quay wall. \u0027How do you think? Did you find anything?\u0027 \u0027Dead fish and broken crates,\u0027 said the Yakut, offering both enforcers a steaming mug. \u0027Nothing alive. It\u0027s been over eight hours now. I have good men searching all the way down to Green Cape.\u0027 Kamar drank deeply, then spat in disgust. \u0027What is this stuff? Pitch?\u0027 Lyubkhin laughed. \u0027Hot cola. From the Fowl Star. It\u0027s coming ashore by the crate-load. Tonight we are truly on the Bay of Kola.\u0027 \u0027Be warned,\u0027 said Vassikin, spilling the liquid on to the snow. \u0027This weather is souring my temper. So no more terrible jokes. It\u0027s enough that I have to listen to Kamar.\u0027 \u0027Not for much longer,\u0027 muttered his partner. \u0027One more sweep and we call off the search. Nothing could survive these waters for eight hours.\u0027 Vassikin held out his empty cup. \u0027Don\u0027t you have something stronger? A shot of vodka to ward off the cold? I know you always keep a flask hidden somewhere.\u0027 Lyubkhin reached for his hip pocket, but stopped when the walkie-talkie on his belt began to emit static. Three short bursts. \u0027Three squawks. That\u0027s the signal.\u0027 \u0027The signal for what?\u0027 Lyubkhin hurried down the docks, shouting back over his shoulder. \u0027Three squawks on the radio. It means that the K9 unit has found someone.\u0027 The survivor was not Russian. That much was obvious from his clothes. Everything, from the designer suit to the leather overcoat, had obviously been purchased in Western Europe, perhaps even America. They were tailored to fit, and made from the highest-quality material. Though the man\u0027s clothes were relatively intact, his body had not fared so well. His bare feet and hands were mottled with frostbite. One leg hung strangely limp below the knee, and his face was a horrific mask of burns. The search crew had carried him from a ravine three klicks south of the harbour on a makeshift tarpaulin stretcher. The men crowded around their prize, stamping their feet against the cold that invaded their boots. Vassikin elbowed his way through the gathering, kneeling for a closer look. \u0027He\u0027ll lose the leg for sure,\u0027 he noted. \u0027A couple of fingers too. The face doesn\u0027t look too good either.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, Doctor Mikhael,\u0027 commented Kamar drily. \u0027Any ID?\u0027 Vassikin conducted a quick thief\u0027s search. Wallet and watch. \u0027Nothing. That\u0027s odd. You\u0027d think a rich man like this would have some personal effects, wouldn\u0027t you?\u0027 Kamar nodded. \u0027Yes, I would.\u0027 He turned to the circle of men. \u0027Ten seconds, then there\u0027ll be trouble. Keep the currency, everything else I need returned.\u0027 The sailors considered it. The man was not big. But he was Mafiya, the Russian organized-crime syndicate. A leather wallet sailed over the crowd, skidding into a dip in the tarpaulin. Moments later it was joined by a Car tier chronograph. Gold with diamond studding. Worth five years of an average Russian\u0027s wages. \u0027Wise decision,\u0027 said Kamar, scooping up the treasure trove. \u0027Well?\u0027 asked Vassikin. \u0027Do we keep him?\u0027 Kamar pulled a platinum Visa card from the kidskin wallet, checking the name. \u0027Oh we keep him,\u0027 he replied, activating his mobile phone. \u0027We keep him, and put some blankets over him. The way our luck\u0027s going, he\u0027ll catch pneumonia. And believe me, we don\u0027t want anything to happen to this man. He\u0027s our ticket to the big time.\u0027 Kamar was getting excited. This was completely out of character for him. Vassikin clambered to his feet. \u0027Who are you calling? Who is this guy?\u0027 Kamar picked a number from his speed-dial menu. \u0027I\u0027m calling Britva. Who do you think I\u0027m calling?\u0027 Vassikin paled. Calling the boss was dangerous. Britva was well known for shooting the bearers of bad news. \u0027It\u0027s good news, right?You\u0027re calling with good news?\u0027 Kamar flipped the Visa at his partner. \u0027Read that.\u0027 Vassikin studied the card for several moments. \u0027I don\u0027t read Angliskii. What does it say? What\u0027s the name?\u0027 Kamar told him. A slow smile spread across Mikhael\u0027s face. \u0027Make the call,\u0027 he said.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/245.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
