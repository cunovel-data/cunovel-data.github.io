{"id":10731,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 1 Family Ties","content":"THE loss of her husband had a profound effect on Angeline Fowl. She had retreated to her room, refusing to go outside. She took refuge in her mind, preferring dreams of the past to real life. It is doubtful whether she would have recovered had not her son, Artemis the Second, done a deal with the elf Holly Short: his mother\u0027s sanity in return for half the ransom gold he had stolen from the fairy police. His mother fully recovered, Artemis Junior focused his efforts on locating his father, investing large chunks of the family fortune in Russian excursions, local intelligence and Internet-search companies.\\n\\n Young Artemis had received a double share of Fowl guile. However, with the recovery of his mother, a moral and beautiful lady, it became increasingly difficult for him to realize his ingenious schemes. Schemes that were ever more necessary to fund the search for his father.\\n\\n Angeline, distraught by her son\u0027s obsession and afraid of the effects of the past two years on his mind, signed up her thirteen-year-old for treatment with the school counsellor.\\n\\n You have to feel sorry for him. The counsellor, that is ...\\n\\n \\n\\n ST BARTLEBY’S SCHOOL FOR YOUNG GENTLEMEN, COUNTY WICKLOW IRELAND, PRESENT DAY\\n\\n \\n\\n Doctor Po leaned back in his padded armchair, eyes flicking across the page in front of him.\\n\\n \u0027Now, Master Fowl, let\u0027s talk, shall we?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis sighed deeply, smoothing his dark hair back from a wide, pale brow. When would people learn that a mind such as his could not be dissected? He himself had read more psychology textbooks than the counsellor. He had even contributed an article to The Psychologists\u0027 Journal under the pseudonym Doctor F. Roy Dean Schlippe.\\n\\n \u0027Certainly, Doctor. Let\u0027s talk about your chair. Victorian?\u0027\\n\\n Po rubbed the leather arm fondly. \u0027Yes, quite correct. Something of a family heirloom. My grandfather acquired it at auction at Sotheby\u0027s. Apparently it once stood in the palace. The Queen\u0027s favourite.\u0027\\n\\n A taut smile stretched Artemis\u0027s lips perhaps a centimetre. \u0027Really, Doctor. They don\u0027t generally allow fakes in the palace.\u0027\\n\\n Po\u0027s grip stretched the worn leather. \u0027Fake? I assure you, Master Fowl, this is completely authentic.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis leaned in for a closer examination. \u0027It\u0027s clever, I grant you. But look here.\u0027 Po\u0027s gaze followed the youth\u0027s finger. \u0027Those furniture tacks. See the criss-cross pattern on the head? Machine tooled. Nineteen twenty at the earliest. Your grandfather was duped. But what matter? A chair is a chair. A possession of no importance, eh, Doctor?\u0027\\n\\n Po scribbled furiously, burying his dismay. \u0027Yes, Artemis, very clever. Just as your file says. Playing your little games. Now, shall we get back to you?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis Fowl the Second straightened the crease in his trousers.\\n\\n \u0027There is a problem here, Doctor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really? And what might that be?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The problem is that I know the textbook replies to any question you care to ask.\u0027\\n\\n Doctor Po jotted in his pad for a full minute. \u0027We do have a problem, Artemis. But that\u0027s not it,\u0027 he said eventually.\\n\\n Artemis almost smiled. No doubt the doctor would treat him to another predictable theory. Which disorder would he have today? Multiple personality perhaps, or maybe he\u0027d be a pathological liar? \\n\\n \u0027The problem is that you don\u0027t respect anyone enough to treat them as an equal.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis was thrown by the statement. This doctor was smarter than the rest. \u0027That\u0027s ridiculous. I hold several people in the highest esteem.\u0027\\n\\n Po did not glance up from his notebook. \u0027Really? Who, for example?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis thought for a moment. \u0027Albert Einstein. His theories were usually correct. And Archimedes, the Greek mathematician.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about someone that you actually know?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis thought hard. No one came to mind.\\n\\n \u0027What? No examples?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis shrugged. \u0027You seem to have all the answers, Doctor Po. Why don\u0027t you tell me?\u0027\\n\\n Po opened a window on his laptop. \u0027Extraordinary. Every time I read this\\n\\n \u0027My biography, I presume?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, it explains a lot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Such as?\u0027 asked Artemis, interested in spite of himself.\\n\\n Doctor Po printed off a page.\\n\\n \u0027Firstly there\u0027s your associate, Butler. A bodyguard, I understand. Hardly a suitable companion for an impressionable boy. Then there\u0027s your mother. A wonderful woman in my opinion, but with absolutely no control over your behaviour. Finally, there\u0027s your father. According to this, he wasn\u0027t much of a role model even when he was alive.\u0027\\n\\n The remark stung, but Artemis wasn\u0027t about to let the doctor realize how much. \u0027Your file is mistaken, Doctor,\u0027 he said. \u0027My father is alive. Missing perhaps, but alive.\u0027\\n\\n Po checked the sheet. \u0027Really? I was under the impression that he has been missing for almost two years. Why, the courts have declared him legally dead.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis\u0027s voice was devoid of emotion, though his heart was pounding. \u0027I don\u0027t care what the courts say, or the Red Cross. He is alive, and I will find him.\u0027\\n\\n Po scratched another note.\\n\\n \u0027But even if your father were to return, what then?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Will you follow in his footsteps? Will you be a criminal like him? Perhaps you already are?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027My father is no criminal,\u0027 Artemis pointed out testily. \u0027He was moving all our assets into legitimate enterprises. The Murmansk venture was completely above board.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re avoiding the question, Artemis,\u0027 said Po.\\n\\n But Artemis had had enough of this line of questioning. Time to play a little game. \u0027Why, Doctor?\u0027 said Artemis, shocked. \u0027This is a sensitive area. For all you know, I could be suffering from depression.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I suppose you could,\u0027 said Po, sensing a breakthrough. \u0027Is that the case?\u0027\\n\\n Artemis dropped his face into his hands. \u0027It\u0027s my mother, Doctor.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your mother?\u0027 prompted Po, trying to keep the excitement from his voice. Artemis had retired half a dozen counsellors from St Bartleby\u0027s already this year. Truth be told, Po was on the point of packing his own bags. But now . . .\\n\\n \u0027My mother, she .. .\u0027\\n\\n Po leaned forward on his fake Victorian chair. \u0027Your mother, yes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She forces me to endure this ridiculous therapy when the school\u0027s so-called counsellors are little better than misguided do-gooders with degrees.\u0027\\n\\n Po sighed. \u0027Very well, Artemis. Have it your way, but you are never going to find peace if you continue to run away from your problems.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis was spared further analysis by the vibration of his mobile phone. It was on a coded secure line. Only one person had the number. The boy retrieved it from his pocket, flipping open the tiny communicator. \u0027Yes?\u0027\\n\\n Butler\u0027s voice came through the speaker. \u0027Artemis. It\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Obviously. I\u0027m in the middle of something here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve had a message.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes. From where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know exactly. But it concerns the Fowl Star.\u0027\\n\\n A jolt flew along Artemis \u0027s spine. \u0027Where are you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The main gate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good man. I\u0027m on my way.\u0027\\n\\n Doctor Po whipped off his spectacles. \u0027This session is not over, young man. We made some progress today, even if you won\u0027t admit it. Leave now and I will be forced to inform the Dean.\u0027\\n\\n The warning was lost on Artemis. He was already somewhere else. A familiar electric buzz was crackling over his skin. This was the beginning of something. He could feel it.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/246.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
