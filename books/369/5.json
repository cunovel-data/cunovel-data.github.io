{"id":10734,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 6 Photo Opportunity","content":"CHUTE E37, HAVENI CITY, THE LOWER ELEMENTS\\n\\n \\n\\n THE unlikely allies took the goblin shuttle up E37. Holly was none too pleased. First of all, she was being ordered to work with public-enemy number one, Artemis Fowl. And secondly, the goblin shuttle was held together by spit and prayers.\\n\\n Holly hooked a corn rig over one pointy ear. \u0027Hey, Foaly? You there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right here, Captain.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Remind me again why I\u0027m flying this old slammer.\u0027 LEPrecon pilots referred to suspect shuttles as slammers because of their alarming tendency to slam into the chute walls.\\n\\n \u0027The reason you\u0027re flying that old slammer, Captain, is that the goblins built this shuttle inside the port, and all three of the original access ramps were removed years ago. It would take days to get a new rig in there. So, I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re stuck with the goblin ship.\u0027\\n\\n Holly strapped herself into the pilot\u0027s wraparound seat. The thruster toggles almost seemed to jump into her hands. For a split second, Captain Short\u0027s natural good humour returned. She was an ace pilot, top of her class in the Academy. On her final assessment, Wing Commander Vinyaya had written that Cadet Short could fly a shuttle pod through the gap in your teeth. It was a compliment with a sting in the tail. On her first try-out in a pod, Holly had lost control, crash-landing the craft two metres from Vinyaya\u0027s nose.\\n\\n So, for five seconds, Holly was happy. Then she remembered who her passengers were.\\n\\n \u0027I wonder, could you tell me,\u0027 said Artemis, settling into the co-pilot\u0027s chair, \u0027how close the Russian terminal is to Murmansk?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Civilians behind the yellow line,\u0027 growled Holly, ignoring the enquiry.\\n\\n Artemis pressed on. \u0027This is important to me. I am trying to plan a rescue.\u0027\\n\\n Holly grinned tightly. \u0027There\u0027s so much irony here, I could write a poem. The kidnapper looking for help with a kidnapping.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis rubbed his temples. \u0027Holly, I am a criminal. It\u0027s what I do best. When I abducted you, I was thinking only of the ransom. You were never supposed to be in any danger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh really?\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Apart from bio-bombs and trolls.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027True,\u0027 admitted Artemis. \u0027Sometimes plans don\u0027t translate smoothly from paper to real life.\u0027 He paused, cleaning some non-existent dirt from his manicured nails. \u0027I have matured, Captain. This is my father. I need all the information I can gather before facing the Mafiya.\u0027\\n\\n Holly relented. It wasn\u0027t easy growing up without a father. She knew. Her own father had passed away when she was barely sixty. More than twenty years ago now.\\n\\n \u0027OK, Mud Boy, listen up. I\u0027m only saying this once.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis sat up. Butler stooped as he entered the cockpit. He could smell a war story.\\n\\n \u0027Over the past two centuries, with the advances in human technology, the LEP have been forced to shut down over sixty terminals. We pulled out of northern Russia in the sixties. The entire Kola peninsula is a nuclear disaster. The People have no tolerance to radiation, we never built up a resistance. In truth, there wasn\u0027t much to close down. Just a Grade Three terminal and a couple of cloaking projectors. The People aren\u0027t very fond of the Arctic. A bit frosty. Everybody was glad to be leaving. So, to answer your question: there\u0027s one unmanned terminal, with little or no above-ground facilities, located about twenty klicks north of Murmansk —\u0027\\n\\n Foaly\u0027s voice blurted from the intercom, interrupting what was dangerously close to a civil conversation. \u0027OK, Captain. You\u0027ve got a clear run to the subway. There\u0027s still a bit of waffle from the last flare, so go easy.\u0027\\n\\n Holly pulled down her mouth mike. \u0027Roger that, Foaly. Have the rad suits ready when I get back. We\u0027re on a tight schedule.\u0027\\n\\n Foaly chuckled. \u0027Take it easy on the thrusters, Holly. Technically, this is Artemis\u0027s first time in the chutes, seeing as he and Butler were mesmerized on the way down. We wouldn\u0027t want him getting a fright.\u0027\\n\\n Holly gunned the throttle quite a bit more than was absolutely necessary. \u0027No,\u0027 she growled. \u0027We wouldn\u0027t want him getting a fright.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis decided to strap on his restraining harness. A good idea, as it turned out.\\n\\n Captain Short gunned the makeshift shuttle down the magnetized approach rail. The fins shook, sending twin waves of sparks cascading past the portholes. Holly adjusted the internal gyroscopes, otherwise there\u0027d be Mud People vomiting all over the cockpit.\\n\\n Holly\u0027s thumbs hovered over the turbo buttons. \u0027OK. Well, let\u0027s see what this bucket can do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t go trying for any records, Holly,\u0027 said Foaly over the speakers. \u0027That ship is not built for speed. I\u0027ve seen more aerodynamic dwarfs.\u0027\\n\\n Holly grunted. After all, what was the point in flying slowly? None whatsoever. And if you happened to terrify a few Mud Men along the way, well, that was just an added bonus.\\n\\n The service tunnel opened on to the main chute. Artemis gasped. It was an awe-inspiring sight. You could drop Mount Everest down this chute and it wouldn\u0027t even hit the sides. A deep red glow pulsed from the Earth\u0027s core like the fires of hell, and the constant crack of contracting rock smacked the hull like physical blows.\\n\\n Holly fired up all four flight engines, tumbling the shuttle into the abyss. Her worries evaporated like the eddies of mist swirling around the cockpit. It was a fly-boy thing. The lower you went without pulling out of the dive, the tougher you were. Even the fiery demise of Retrieval Officer Bom Arbles couldn\u0027t stop the LEP pilots core diving. Holly held the current record. Five hundred metres from the Earth\u0027s core before dipping the flaps. That had cost her two weeks\u0027 suspension, plus a hefty fine.\\n\\n Not today though. No records in a slammer. With the g-force rippling the skin on her cheeks, Holly dragged the joysticks back, pulling the nose out of vertical. It gave her no small satisfaction to hear both humans sigh with relief.\\n\\n \u0027OK, Foaly, we\u0027re on the up \u0027n\u0027 up. What\u0027s the situation above ground?\u0027\\n\\n She could hear Foaly tapping a keyboard. \u0027Sorry, Holly. I can\u0027t get a lock on any of our surface equipment. Too much radiation from the last flare. You\u0027re on your own. Holly eyed the two pale humans in the cockpit. On my own, she thought. I wish.\\n\\n \\n\\n PARIS, FRANCE\\n\\n \\n\\n So, if Artemis wasn\u0027t the human helping Cudgeon in his quest to arm the B\u0027wa Kell, who was? Some tyrannical dictator? Perhaps a disgruntled general with access to an unlimited supply of power cells? Well, no. Not exactly.\\n\\n Luc Carrere was responsible for selling batteries to the B\u0027wa Kell. Not that you\u0027d know it to look at him. In fact, he didn\u0027t even know it himself. Luc was a small-time French private eye, who was well known for his inefficiency. In PI circles, it was said that Luc couldn\u0027t trace a golf ball in a barrel of mozzarella.\\n\\n Cudgeon decided to use Luc for three reasons. One, Foaly\u0027s files showed that Carrere had a reputation as a wheeler-dealer. In spite of his ineptness as an investigator, Luc had a knack for laying his hand on whatever it was the client wanted to buy. Two, the man was greedy and had never been able to resist the lure of easy money. And three, Luc was stupid. And as every little fairy knows, weak minds are easier to mesmerize.\\n\\n The fact that he had located Carrere in Foaly\u0027s database was nearly enough to make Cudgeon smile. Of course, Briar would have preferred not to have any human link in the chain. But a chain comprised completely of goblin links is one dumb chain.\\n\\n Establishing contact with any Mud Man was not something Cudgeon took lightly. Deranged as he was, Briar was well aware of what would happen if the humans got wind of a new market below ground. They would swarm to the Earth\u0027s core like an army of red-backed flesh-eating ants. Cudgeon was not ready to meet the humans head on. Not yet. Not until he had the might of the LEP behind him.\\n\\n So instead, Cudgeon sent Luc Carrere a little package. First class, shielded goblin mail ...\\n\\n Luc Carrere had shuffled into his office apartment\u0027 one July evening to find a small parcel lying on his desk. The package was nothing more than a FedEx delivery. Or something that looked very much like a FedEx delivery.\\n\\n Luc slit the tape. Inside the box, cushioned on a nest of hundred-euro bills, was a small flat device of some kind. Like a portable CD player, but made from a strange black metal that seemed to absorb light. Luc would have shouted to reception and instructed his secretary to hold all calls. If he had had a reception. If he had had a secretary. Instead the PI began stuffing cash down his grease-stained shirt as though the notes would disappear.\\n\\n Suddenly, the device popped open, clam-like, revealing a micro-screen and speakers. A shadowy face appeared on the display. Though Luc could see nothing but a pair of red-rimmed eyes, that was enough to set goose bumps popping across his back.\\n\\n Funny though, because when the face began to speak, Luc\u0027s worries slid away like an old snakeskin. How could he have been worried?This person was obviously a friend. What a lovely voice. Like a choir of angels, all on its own.\\n\\n \u0027Luc Carrere?\u0027\\n\\n Luc nearly cried. Poetry.\\n\\n \u0027Oui. It\u0027s me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bonsoir. Do you see the money, Luc? It\u0027s all yours.\u0027 Sixty miles below ground, Cudgeon almost smiled. This was easier than expected. He had been worried that the dribble of power left in his brain wouldn\u0027t be sufficient to mesmerize the human. But this particular Mud Man seemed to have the will-power of a hungry hog faced with a trough of turnips.\\n\\n Luc held two wads of cash in his fists. \u0027This money. It\u0027s mine? What do I have to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. The money is yours. Do whatever you want.\u0027\\n\\n Now Luc Carrere knew that there was no such thing as free cash, but that voice ... That voice was truth in a micro-speaker.\\n\\n \u0027But there\u0027s more. A lot more.\u0027\\n\\n Luc stopped what he was doing, which was kissing a hundred-euro bill. \u0027More? How much more?\u0027\\n\\n The eyes seemed to glow crimson. \u0027As much as you want, Lac. But to get it, I need you to do me a favour.\u0027\\n\\n Luc was hooked. \u0027Sure. What kind of favour?\u0027\\n\\n The voice emanating from the speaker was as clear as spring water. \u0027It\u0027s simple, not even illegal. I need batteries, Luc. Thousands of batteries. Maybe millions. Do you think you can get them for me?\u0027\\n\\n Luc thought about it for about two seconds. The banknotes were tickling his chin. As a matter of fact, he had a contact on the river who regularly shipped boatloads of hardware to the Middle East, including batteries. Luc was confident that some of those shipments could be diverted.\\n\\n \u0027Batteries. Oui, certainment, I could do that.\u0027\\n\\n And so it went on for several months. Luc Carrere hit his contact for every battery he could lay his hands on. It was a sweet deal. Luc would crate the cells up in his apartment and in the morning they would be gone. In their place would sit a fresh pile of bills. Of course, the euros were fake, run off on an old Koboi printer, but Luc couldn\u0027t tell the difference. Nobody outside the Treasury could.\\n\\n Occasionally, the voice on the screen would make a special request. Some fire suits, for example. But hey, Luc was a player now. Nothing was more than a phone call away. In six months, Luc Carrere went from a one-room studio to a fancy loft apartment in St Germain. So naturally, the Surete and Interpol were building separate cases against him. But Luc wasn\u0027t to know that. All he knew was that for the first time in his corrupt life, he was riding the gravy train.\\n\\n One morning there was another parcel on his new marble-topped desk. Bigger this time. Bulkier. But Luc wasn\u0027t worried. It was probably more money.\\n\\n Luc popped the top to reveal an aluminium case and a second communicator. The eyes were waiting for him.\\n\\n \u0027Bonjour, Luc. fa ra?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bien,\u0027 replied Luc, mesmerized from the first syllable.\\n\\n \u0027I have a special assignment for you today. Do this right and you will never have to worry about money again. Your tool is in the case.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 asked the PI nervously. The instrument looked like a weapon and, even though Luc was mesmerized, Cudgeon did not have enough magic to completely suppress the Parisian\u0027s nature. The PI may have been devious, but he was no killer.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a special camera, Luc, that\u0027s all. If you pull that thing that looks like a trigger, it takes a picture,\u0027 said Cudgeon.\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Luc Carrere blearily.\\n\\n \u0027Some friends of mine are coming to visit you. And I want you to take their picture. It\u0027s just a game we play.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How will I know your friends?\u0027 asked Luc. \u0027A lot of people visit me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They will ask about the batteries. If they ask about the batteries, then you take their picture.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure. Great.\u0027 And it was great. Because the voice would never make him do anything wrong. The voice was his friend.\\n\\n \\n\\n E37 SHUTTLE PORT\\n\\n \\n\\n Holly steered the slammer through the chute\u0027s final section. A proximity sensor in the shuttle\u0027s nose set off the landing lights.\\n\\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 muttered Holly.\\n\\n Artemis squinted through the quartz windscreen. \u0027A problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. It\u0027s just that those lights shouldn\u0027t be working. There hasn\u0027t been a power source in the terminal since the last century.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Our goblin friends, I presume.\u0027\\n\\n Holly frowned. \u0027Doubtful. It takes half a dozen goblins to turn on a glow cube. Wiring a shuttle port takes real know-how. Elfin know-how.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The plot thickens,\u0027 said Artemis. If he\u0027d had a beard, he would have stroked it. \u0027I smell a traitor. Now, who would have access to all this technology and a motive for selling it?\u0027\\n\\n Holly pointed the shuttle\u0027s cone towards the landing nodes. \u0027We\u0027ll find out soon enough. You just get me a live trader, and my mesmer will soon have him spilling his guts.\u0027\\n\\n The shuttle docked with a pneumatic hiss as the bay\u0027s rubber collar formed an airtight seal around the outer hull.\\n\\n Butler was out of his chair before the seat-belt light winked off, ready for action.\\n\\n \u0027Just don\u0027t kill anyone,\u0027 warned Holly. \u0027That\u0027s not how the LEP likes to operate. Anyway, dead Mud Men don\u0027t rat on their partners.\u0027\\n\\n She brought up a schematic on the wall-screen. It depicted Par is\u0027s old city. \u0027OK,\u0027 she said, pointing to a bridge across the Seine. \u0027We\u0027re here. Under this bridge, sixty metres from Notre-Dame. The cathedral, not the football team. The dock is disguised as a bridge support. Stand in the doorway until I give you a green light. We have to be careful here. The last thing we need is some Parisian seeing you emerging from a brick wall.\u0027 , . . \u0027You\u0027re not accompanying us?\u0027 asked Artemis.\\n\\n \u0027Orders,\u0027 said Holly, scowling. \u0027Apparently this could be a trap. Who knows what hardware is pointed at the terminal door? Lucky for you, you\u0027re expendable. Irish tourists on holiday, you\u0027ll fit right in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Lucky us. What leads do we have?\u0027\\n\\n Holly slid a disk into the console. \u0027Foaly stuck his Retimager on the goblin prisoner. Apparently he has seen this human.\u0027\\n\\n The captain brought up a mugshot on the screen. \u0027Foaly got a match on his Interpol files. Luc Carrere. Disbarred attorney, does a bit of PI work.\u0027\\n\\n She printed off a card. \u0027Here\u0027s his address. He just moved to a swanky new apartment. It could be nothing, but at least we have somewhere to start. I need you to immobilize him, and show him this.\u0027 Holly handed the bodyguard what looked like a diver\u0027s watch.\\n\\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 asked the manservant.\\n\\n \u0027Just a com screen. You put it in front of Carrere\u0027s face and I can mesmerize the truth out of him from down here. It also contains one of Foaly\u0027s doodahs: a personal shield. The Safetynet. A prototype, you\u0027ll be delighted to know. You have the honour of testing it. Touch the screen, and the micro-reactor generates a two-metre diameter sphere of tri-phased light. No good for solids, but laser bursts or concussion shocks are OK.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hmm,\u0027 said Butler doubtfully. \u0027We don\u0027t get a lot of laser bursts above ground.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Hey, don\u0027t use it. Do I care?\u0027\\n\\n Butler studied the tiny instrument. \u0027One-metre radius? What about the bits that are sticking out.\u0027\\n\\n Holly thumped the manservant playfully in the stomach. \u0027My advice to you, big man, is curl up in a ball.\u0027\\n\\n ‘I’ll try to remember that,\u0027 said Butler, cinching the strap around his wrist. \u0027You two try not to kill each other while I\u0027m gone.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis was surprised. It didn\u0027t happen very often. \u0027While you\u0027re gone? Surely you don\u0027t expect me to stay behind?\u0027\\n\\n Butler tapped his forehead. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, you\u0027ll see everything on the iris-cam.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis fumed for several moments, before settling back down into the co-pilot\u0027s seat. \u0027I know. I would only slow you down, and that, in turn, would slow down the search for my father.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course, if you insist\\n\\n \u0027No. This is no time for childishness.\u0027\\n\\n Butler smiled gently. Childishness was one thing Master Artemis was hardly likely to be accused of.\\n\\n \u0027How long do I have?\u0027\\n\\n Holly shrugged. \u0027As long as it takes. Obviously the sooner the better for everybody\u0027s sake.\u0027 She glanced at Artemis. \u0027Especially his father\u0027s.\u0027\\n\\n In spite of everything, Butler felt good. This was life at its most basic. The hunt. Not exactly Stone Age, not with a large semi-automatic weapon under his arm. But the principle was the same: the survival of the fittest. And there was no doubt in Butler\u0027s mind that he was the fittest.\\n\\n He followed Holly\u0027s directions to a service ladder, scaling it quickly to the doorway above. He waited beside the metal door until the light above changed from red to green, and the camouflaged entrance slid noiselessly back. The bodyguard emerged cautiously. While it was likely that the bridge was deserted, he could hardly explain himself away as a homeless person, dressed as he was in a dark designer suit.\\n\\n Butler felt a breeze play across the shaven dome of his crown. The morning air felt good, even after a few hours below ground. He could easily imagine how fairies must feel, forced out of their native environment by humans. From what Butler had seen, if the People ever decided to reclaim what was theirs, the battle wouldn\u0027t last long. But luckily for mankind, fairies were a peace-loving people, and not prepared to go to war over real estate.\\n\\n The coast was clear. Butler stepped casually on to the riverside walkway, proceeding west towards the St Germain district.\\n\\n A riverboat swept past on his right, ferrying a hundred tourists around the city. Butler automatically covered his face with a massive hand. Just in case some of those tourists had cameras pointed in his direction.\\n\\n The bodyguard mounted a set of stone steps to the road above. Behind him the pointed spire of Notre-Dame rose into the sky, and to his left the Eiffel Tower\u0027s famous profile punctured the clouds. Butler strode confidently across the main road, nodding at several French ladies who stopped to stare. He was familiar with this area of Paris, having spent a month recuperating here after a particularly dangerous assignment for the French Secret Service.\\n\\n Butler strolled along Rue Jacob. Even at this hour, cars and lorries jammed the narrow street. Drivers leaned on their horns, hanging from car windows, Gallic tempers running wild. Mopeds dodged between bumpers, and several pretty girls strolled past. Butler smiled. Paris. He had forgotten.\\n\\n Carrere\u0027s apartment was on Rue Bonaparte, opposite the church. Apartments in St Germain cost more per month than most Parisians made in a year. Butler ordered a coffee and croissant at the Bonaparte cafe, settling himself at an outside table. According to his calculations, it gave him the perfect view of Monsieur Carrere\u0027s balcony.\\n\\n Butler didn\u0027t have long to wait. In less than an hour, the chunky Parisian appeared on the balcony, leaning on the ornate railing for several minutes. He very obligingly presented front and side views of himself.\\n\\n Holly\u0027s voice sounded in Butler\u0027s ear. \u0027That\u0027s our boy. Is he alone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t tell,\u0027 muttered the bodyguard into his hand.The flesh-tone mike glued to his throat would pick up any vibrations and translate them for Holly.\\n\\n \u0027Just a sec.\u0027\\n\\n Butler heard a keyboard being tapped, and suddenly the iris-cam in his eye sparked. The vision in one eye jumped into a completely different spectrum.\\n\\n \u0027Heat-sensitive,\u0027 Holly informed him. \u0027Hot equals red. Cold equals blue. Not a very powerful system, but the lens should penetrate an outer wall.\u0027\\n\\n Butler cast a fresh eye over the apartment. There were three red objects in the room. One was Carrere\u0027s heart, which pulsed crimson in the centre of his pink body. The second appeared to be a kettle or possibly a coffee pot, and the third was a TV.\\n\\n \u0027OK. All clear, I\u0027m going in.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Affirmative. Watch your step. This is a bit too convenient.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Agreed.\u0027\\n\\n Butler crossed the cobbled street to the four-storey apartment building. There was an intercom security system, but this structure was nineteenth century, and a solid shoulder at the right point popped the bolt right out of its housing.\\n\\n ‘I’m in.’\\n\\n There was noise on the stairs above. Someone coming this way. Butler wasn\u0027t unduly concerned. Nevertheless he slid a palm inside his jacket, fingers resting on his handgun\u0027s grip. It was unlikely he would need it. Even the most boisterous young bucks generally gave Butler a wide berth. Something to do with his merciless eyes. Being over two metres tall didn\u0027t hurt either.\\n\\n A group of teenagers rounded the corner.\\n\\n \u0027Excusez-moi,\u0027 said Butler, gallantly stepping aside.\\n\\n The girls giggled. The boys glared. One, a mono-eyebrowed rugby type, even thought about passing comment. Then Butler winked at him. It was a peculiar wink, somehow simultaneously cheerful and terrifying. No comments were passed.\\n\\n Butler ascended to the fourth floor without incident. Carrere\u0027s apartment was on the gable end. Two walls of windows. Very expensive.\\n\\n The bodyguard was considering his breaking and entering options when he noticed the door was open. Open doors generally meant one of two things: one, nobody was left alive to close it, or two, he was expected. Neither of these options appealed to him particularly.\\n\\n Butler entered cautiously. The apartment walls were lined with open crates. Battery packs and fire suits poked through the Styrofoam packing. The floor was littered with thick wads of currency.\\n\\n \u0027Are you a friend?\u0027 It was Carrere. He was slumped in an oversized armchair, a weapon of some kind nestling in his lap.\\n\\n Butler approached slowly. An important rule of combat is that every opponent is taken seriously.\\n\\n \u0027Take it easy.\u0027\\n\\n The Parisian raised the weapon. The grip was made for smaller fingers. A child, or a fairy. \u0027I asked if you were a friend.\u0027\\n\\n Butler cocked his own pistol. \u0027No need to shoot.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Stand still,\u0027 ordered Carrere. \u0027I\u0027m not going to shoot you, just take your photo maybe. The voice told me.\u0027\\n\\n Holly\u0027s voice sounded in Butler\u0027s earpiece. \u0027Get closer. I need to see the eyes.\u0027\\n\\n Butler bolstered his weapon, taking a step forward. \u0027You see, no one has to get hurt here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m going to enhance the image,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027This may sting a bit.\u0027\\n\\n The tiny camera in his eye buzzed, and suddenly Butler\u0027s vision was magnified by four — which would have been just fine had the magnification not been accompanied by a sharp jolt of pain. Butler blinked back a stream of tears from his eye.\\n\\n Below, in the goblin shuttle, Holly studied Luc\u0027s pupils. \u0027He\u0027s been mesmerized,\u0027 she pronounced. \u0027Several times. You see how the iris has actually become jagged. You mesmerize a human too much and they can go blind.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis studied the image. \u0027Is it safe to mesmerize him again?\u0027\\n\\n Holly shrugged. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter. He\u0027s already under a spell. This particular individual is just following orders. His brain doesn\u0027t know a thing about it.\u0027\\n\\n Artemis grabbed the mike stand. \u0027Butler! Get out of there. Right now.\u0027\\n\\n In the apartment, Butler stood his ground. Any sudden movement might be his last.\\n\\n \u0027Butler,\u0027 said Holly. \u0027Listen carefully. That gun pointed at you is a wide-bore low-frequency blaster. We call it a Bouncer. It was developed for tunnel skirmishes. If he pulls that trigger, a wide arc laser is going to ricochet off the walls until it hits something.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 muttered Butler.\\n\\n \u0027What did you say?\u0027 asked Carrere.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. I just don\u0027t like having my photo taken.\u0027\\n\\n A spark of Luc\u0027s greedy personality surfaced. \u0027I like that watch on your wrist. It looks expensive. Is it a Rolex?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t want this,\u0027 said Butler, very reluctant to part with the com screen. \u0027It\u0027s cheap. A piece of trash.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just give me the watch.\u0027\\n\\n Butler peeled back the strap of the instrument on his wrist. \u0027If I give you this watch, maybe you can tell me about all these batteries.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is you! Say cheese,\u0027 squealed Carrere, forcing his pudgy thumb into the undersized trigger guard and pumping for all he was worth.\\n\\n For Butler, time seemed to slow to a crawl. It was almost as though he were inside his personal time-stop. His soldier\u0027s brain absorbed all the facts and analysed his options. Carrere\u0027s finger was too far gone. In a moment, a wide-bore laser burst would be speeding his way, and would continue to bounce around the room until they were both dead. His gun was of no use in a situation like this. All he had was the Safetynet, but a two-metre sphere was not going to be enough. Not for two good-sized humans.\\n\\n So, in the fraction of a second left to him, Butler formulated a new strategy. If the sphere could stop concussive waves coming towards him, perhaps it could stop them coming out of the blaster. Butler touched the screen of the Safetynet, and hurled the device in Carrere\u0027s direction.\\n\\n Not a nanosecond too soon, a spherical shield blossomed, enveloping the expanding beam from Carrere\u0027s blaster: 360 degrees of protection. It was a sight to see, a fireworks display in a bubble. The shield hovered in the air, shafts of light ricocheting against the sphere\u0027s curved planes.\\n\\n Carrere was hypnotized by the sight, and Butler took advantage of the distraction to disarm him.\\n\\n \u0027Start the engines,\u0027 grunted the bodyguard into his throat mike. \u0027The Surete are going to be all over this place in minutes. Foaly\u0027s Safetynet didn\u0027t stop the noise.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Roger that. What about Monsieur Carrere?\u0027\\n\\n Butler dumped the dazed Parisian flat on the carpet. \u0027Luc and I are going to have a little chat.\u0027\\n\\n For the first time Carrere seemed to be aware of his surroundings.\\n\\n \u0027Who are you?\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027What\u0027s happening?\u0027\\n\\n Butler ripped open the man\u0027s shirt, placing his palm flat on the Pi\u0027s heart. Time for a little trick he\u0027d learned from Madame Ko, his Japanese sensei. \u0027Don\u0027t worry, Monsieur Carrere. I\u0027m a doctor.There\u0027s been an accident, but you\u0027re perfectly fine.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An accident? I don\u0027t remember any accident.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Trauma. It\u0027s quite normal. I\u0027m just going to check your vitals.\u0027\\n\\n Butler placed a thumb on Luc\u0027s neck, locating the artery. \u0027I\u0027m going to ask you a few questions, to check for concussion.\u0027\\n\\n Luc didn\u0027t argue. Then again, who\u0027d argue with a two-metre-plus Eurasian with muscles like a Michelangelo statue?\\n\\n \u0027Is your name Luc Carrere?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027\\n\\n Butler noted the pulse rate. One from the heartbeat, and a second reference on the carotid artery. Steady, in spite of the accident.\\n\\n \u0027Are you a private eye?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I prefer the title investigator.\u0027\\n\\n No increase in pulse rate. The man was telling the truth.\\n\\n \u0027Have you ever sold batteries to a mystery buyer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I have not,\u0027 protested Luc. \u0027What kind of doctor are you?\u0027\\n\\n The man\u0027s pulse sky-rocketed. He was lying.\\n\\n \u0027Answer the questions, Monsieur Carrere,\u0027 said Butler sternly. \u0027Just one more. Have you ever had dealings with goblins?\u0027\\n\\n Relief flooded through Luc. The police did not ask questions about fairies. \u0027What are you? Crazy? Goblins? I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\u0027\\n\\n Butler closed his eyes, concentrating on the pounding beneath his thumb and palm. Luc\u0027s pulse had settled. He was telling the truth. He had never had any direct dealings with the goblins. Obviously the B\u0027wa Kell wasn\u0027t that stupid.\\n\\n Butler stood up, pocketing the Bouncer. He could hear the sirens on the street below.\\n\\n \u0027Hey, Doctor,\u0027 protested Luc. \u0027You can\u0027t just leave me like this.\u0027\\n\\n Butler eyed him coldly. \u0027I would take you with me, but the police will want to know why your apartment is full of what I suspect are counterfeit bills.\u0027\\n\\n Luc could only watch with his mouth open as the giant figure disappeared into the corridor. He knew he should run, but Luc Carrere hadn\u0027t run more than fifty metres since gym class in the nineteen seventies, and anyway, his legs had suddenly turned to jelly. The thought of a long stretch in prison can do that to a person.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82/249.html","bookId":369,"book":{"id":369,"title":"阿特米斯之北极圈的挑战 Artemis Fowl:The Arctic Incident","description":"简介： 古老的传说中，在遥远天空彩虹的尽头，藏着精灵世界的黄金法尔家族是一个国际上有名的传奇家族，家族中年仅12岁的阿特米斯，更是一个人小鬼大的奇才。阿特米斯的父亲在一次运送货品至俄罗斯的途中，和25万罐可乐一同消失在冰天雪地里，家族重担便落到阿特米斯肩上。绑架...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201409/01/16-13-05-41-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/82","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:39 AM"}}
