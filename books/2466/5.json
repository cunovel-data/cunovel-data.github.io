{"id":81846,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"He gazed over the breakfast table-a bowl of strawberries and melon, three eggs over easy, six slices of rare roast beef, corn muffins, a chilled glass of apricot nectar, and a pot of fresh brewed coffee-nodded a satisfied dismissal at the young woman who delivered it, and snapped open his copy of the national paper. While he\u0027d had the morning editions of all three Toronto papers delivered, it had been easy to tell which he should read first. Only one had more text than pictures.\n After devouring the child\u0027s ka, he had spent the rest of the day acquiring suitable garments and a place to stay. The shopkeepers in the small and very exclusive men\u0027s wear stores along Bloor Street West had been so concerned with status that they\u0027d been almost embarrassingly easy to enchant and later the manager of the Park Plaza Hotel had responded so well to appearance and arrogance that he\u0027d barely needed to use power at all.\n He had registered as Anwar Tawfik, a name he\u0027d pulled from the ka of Elias Rax. Not since the time of Merinar, the first Pharaoh, had he used his true name and by the time the priests of Thoth trapped and bound him, he\u0027d been called so many things that they could place only what he was, not who, on their binding spell. If they\u0027d had his true name, he\u0027d not have gotten free so easily.\n He\u0027d chosen the Park Plaza because it overlooked both the museum and, a little farther south, the provincial seat of government. He could, in fact, see both from the windows of his corner suite. The museum held only a certain amount of sentimental significance. Queen\u0027s Park, he would take as his own.\n In the old days, when those who had held secular power had also wielded religious might, when there had been no division between the two and the Pharaoh had been the living Horus, he had had to build his power structure from the bottom up, from the disenfranchised and the discontented. In this age, Church and State were kept forcibly separate and that left the State ripe for his plucking.\n Often in those days, he found only enough unsworn ka to extend his own life and had hoarded what power he had lest he and his god ultimately perish. Now, with so few sworn, he had no need to conserve power. He could use what magic he wished, bend the mighty to his will, knowing that a multitude existed for him to feed from.\n Akhekh, he knew, would not properly appreciate the situation. His lord had? simple tastes. A temple, a few acolytes, and a little generated despair kept Akhekh happy.\n Folding the paper into quarters, he poured himself a cup of coffee and sat back, allowing the October sun to brush warmth across his face. He had awoken in a cold, gray land where leaves the color of blood lay damply underfoot. He missed the clean golden lines of the desert, the presence of the Nile, the smell of spice and sweat but, as the world he missed no longer existed, he would make this world his own.\n And frankly, he didn\u0027t see how anyone could stop him.\n \u0027Homicide. Detective-Sergeant Celluci. You sure? Caused by what?\"\n Dave Graham watched his partner scowl and took bets with himself as to who was on the other end of the phone. There were a number of reports still outstanding although they had already received the photographs and an analysis from the lab on the contents of the trap.\n \u0027You\u0027re sure there\u0027s nothing else?\" Celluci drummed on the desktop with his fingertips. \"Yeah. Yeah, thanks.\" Although obviously annoyed, he hung up the phone with exaggerated care-the department had refused to replace any more receivers. \"Dr. Rax died because his heart stopped.\"\n Ah, the coroner. He owed himself a quarter. \"And why did the good doctor\u0027s heart stop?\"\n Celluci snorted. \"They don\u0027t know.\" He picked up his coffee, swirled it around to break the scum that had formed over the last two hours, and drank. \"Apparently, it just stopped.\"\n \u0027Drugs? Disease?\"\n \u0027Nada. There were signs of a struggle, but no evidence of a blow to the chest. He\u0027d had a sandwich, a glass of milk, and a piece of blueberry pie about four hours before he died. He was, according to fatigue buildup in the muscles, a bit tired.\" Celluci shoved an overly long curl of hair back off his forehead. \"Dr. Rax was a healthy fifty-two-year-old. He caught a naked intruder in the Egyptology workroom and his heart stopped.\"\n \u0027Well,\" Dave shrugged. \"I suppose it happens.\"\n \u0027What happens?\"\n \u0027Hearts stop.\"\n \u0027Bullshit.\" Celluci crumbled his cup and tossed it at the garbage basket. It hit the rim, sprayed a few drops of coffee on the side of the desk, and dropped in. \"Two deaths by unexplained heart failure in the same room in less than twenty-four hours is?\"\n \u0027A gruesome coincidence.\" Dave shook his head at his partner\u0027s expression. \"This is a high stress world we live in, Mike. Any little extra can tip you over. Ellis saw something that frightened him, his heart couldn\u0027t take it, he died. Dr. Rax interrupted an intruder, they fought, his heart couldn\u0027t take it, he died. As I said, it happens. Cardiovascular failure, occurring not as a direct result of violence, doesn\u0027t come under our jurisdiction.\"\n \u0027Big words,\" Celluci grunted.\n \u0027Well, I\u0027m ready to conclude this wasn\u0027t a homicide and toss it over to the B and E boys.\"\n Celluci swung his legs off the desk and stood. \"I\u0027m not.\"\n \u0027Why not?\"\n He thought about it for a moment and finally shrugged. He couldn\u0027t really come up with a reason, even for himself. \"Call it a hunch.\"\n Dave sighed. He hated police work based solely on intuition, but Celluci\u0027s arrest record was certainly good enough to allow him to ride a hunch or two. He surrendered. \"So, where\u0027re you going?\"\n \u0027Lab.\"\n Watching his partner stride away, Dave considered phoning the lab and warning them. His hand was on the receiver when he changed his mind. \"Nah.\" He settled back in his chair and grinned. \"Why should I have all the fun?\"\n \u0027This is a piece of linen?\" Celluci stared into the mylar envelope and decided to take Doreen\u0027s word for it. \"What\u0027s it off of?\"\n \u0027An ancient Egyptian ceremonial robe, probably a size sixteen extra long. It had an empire waist, pleated sleeves, and how the blazes should I know?\" Doreen Chui folded her arms and stared up at the detective. \"You bring me twenty-two milliliters of sludge that\u0027s just had an acid bath and I pull out a square millimeter of linen. More miracles than that you shouldn\u0027t ask for.\"\n Celluci took a step back. Small women always made him feel vaguely intimidated. \"Sorry. What can you tell me about it?\"\n \u0027Two things. One, it\u0027s old.\" She raised a cautionary hand. \"I don\u0027t know how old. Two, there\u0027s a bit of pigment on one of the fibers that\u0027s about fifty,\u0027fifty blood and a type of vegetable paint. Also old. Nothing to do with last night\u0027s body. At least not as far as precious bodily fluids are concerned.\"\n He took a closer look at the fleck of grayish-brown substance. Raymond Thompson had said that the coffin was Eighteenth Dynasty. He wasn\u0027t sure when exactly that was, but if the bit of linen could be placed in the same time period? he\u0027d be building a case against a mummy that everyone insisted didn\u0027t exist. That should go over like a visit from a civil rights lawyer. \"You couldn\u0027t find out how old this is, could you?\"\n \u0027You want me to carbon date it?\"\n \u0027Well, yes.\"\n \u0027Drop dead, Celluci. You want that kind of an analysis done-provided I had a big enough sample which I don\u0027t- you get the city to stop cutting my budget so I can get the equipment and the staff.\" She slapped her palm down on the desk. \"Until them, you got a scrap of linen with a bloody paint stain on it. Capesh?\"\n \u0027So, you\u0027re finished with it?\"\n Doreen sighed. \"Don\u0027t make me explain it to you again, Detective. I\u0027ve had a hard morning.\"\n \u0027Right.\" He carefully slid the envelope into his inside jacket pocket, and tried an apologetic smile. \"Thanks.\"\n \u0027You really want to thank me,\" she muttered, turning back to her work, the smile apparently having no effect, \"put a moratorium on murder until I take care of my backlog.\"\n Dr. Shane held the mylar envelope up to the light, then, shaking her head, laid it back down on the desk. \"If you say that\u0027s a piece of linen, Detective, I believe you, but I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t tell you what it\u0027s from or how old it is. When we get the inventory finished and find out what\u0027s missing, well, maybe we\u0027ll know what went down the sink?\"\n \u0027It had to be something that the intruder felt would give him away,\" Celluci mused.\n \u0027Why?\" The detective had a very penetrating gaze, Dr. Shane realized as he turned it on her. And very attractive brown eyes with the sort of long, thick lashes most women would kill for. With an effort she got her train of thought back on track. \"I mean, why couldn\u0027t it have just been senseless vandalism?\"\n \u0027No, too specific and too neat. A vandal might have dumped acid on some of your artifacts, but they wouldn\u0027t have rinsed down the sink afterward. And,\" he sighed and brushed the curl of hair back off his forehead, \"they wouldn\u0027t have started with that. They\u0027d have knocked a few things over first. What about the blood,\u0027paint mixture?\"\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s unusual.\" Dr. Shane frowned down at the linen. \"Are you sure that the blood was actually mixed with the pigment and hadn\u0027t just been splashed on at some later date?\"\n \u0027I\u0027m sure.\" He sat forward in his chair and leaned his forearms across his knees, then had to shift as his holster jabbed him in the small of the back. \"Our lab is very good with blood. They get a lot of practice.\"\n \u0027^Yes, I suppose they do.\" She sighed and pushed the sample toward him. \"Well, then, the only historical explanation that comes to mind is that this is a piece of a spell.\" She settled back and steepled her fingers, her voice taking on a lecturing tone. \"Most Egyptian priests were also wizards and their spells were not only chanted but written on strips of linen or papyrus when the matter was deemed serious enough to need physical representation. Occasionally, when very powerful spells were needed, the wizard would mix his blood with the paint in order to tie his life force to the magic.\"\n Celluci laid his hand down on the envelope. \"So this is a part of a very powerful spell.\"\n \u0027It seems that way, yes.\"\n Powerful enough to keep a mummy locked in its coffin? he wondered. He decided not to ask. The last thing he wanted was Dr. Shane thinking he was some kind of a nut case who\u0027d gotten his training from old Boris Karloff movies. That would definitely slow down the investigation. He slid the envelope back into his jacket pocket. \"They mentioned carbon dating at the lab??\"\n Dr. Shane shook her head. \"Too small a sample; they need at least two square inches. It\u0027s why the Church objected to dating the Shroud of Turin for so long.\" Her gaze focused somewhere in memory, then she shook her head and smiled. \"It\u0027s one of the reasons anyway.\"\n \u0027Dr. Shane?\" The tapping on the door and the entry were pretty much simultaneous. \"Sorry to disturb you, but you said you wanted that inventory the moment we finished.\" At the assistant curator\u0027s nod, Doris crossed the room and laid a stack of papers on the desk. \"Nothing\u0027s missing, nothing even looks disturbed, but we did find a whole pile of useless film in the darkroom. Every single frame\u0027s been overexposed on about thirty rolls and we\u0027ve got a stack of video tapes that show nothing but basic black.\"\n \u0027Do you know what was on them?\" Celluci asked getting to his feet.\n Doris looked chagrined. \"Actually, I haven\u0027t the faintest. I\u0027ve accounted for everything I\u0027ve shot over the last little while.\"\n \u0027If you could put them to one side, I\u0027ll have someone come and pick them up.\"\n \u0027I\u0027ll leave them where they are, then.\" Doris paused on her way out the door and glanced back at the police officer. \"If they\u0027re still usable though, I\u0027d like them back. Video tape doesn\u0027t grow on trees.\"\n \u0027I\u0027ll do my best,\" he assured her. When the door had closed behind her, he turned back to Dr. Shane. \"Budget cuts?\"\n She laughed humorlessly. \"When isn\u0027t it? I just wish I had more for you. I went over Dr. Rax\u0027s office again after your people left and I couldn\u0027t find anything missing except that suit.\"\n Which at least gave them the relative size of the intruder-if there had even been an intruder. The ROM had excellent security and there\u0027d been no evidence of anyone entering or leaving. It could have been an inside job; a friend of the dead janitor maybe, up poking around, who\u0027d panicked when Dr. Rax had his heart attack. The name Dr. Von Thorne had come up a couple of times during yesterday\u0027s questioning as one of Dr. Rax\u0027s least favorite people. Maybe he\u0027d been poking around and panicked-except that they\u0027d already questioned Dr. Von Thorne and he had an airtight alibi, not to mention an extremely protective wife. Still, there were a number of possibilities that had nothing to do with an apparently nonexistent mummy.\n While various theories were chasing each other\u0027s tails in Celluci\u0027s head, pan of him watched appreciatively as Dr. Shane came around from behind her desk.\n \u0027You mentioned on the phone that you wanted to see the sarcophagus?\" she said, heading for the door.\n He followed her out. \"I\u0027d like to, yes.\"\n \u0027It wasn\u0027t in the workroom, you know. We\u0027d already moved it across the hall.\"\n \u0027To the storage room.\" He could feel the stare of the departmental secretary as they crossed the outer office. \"What are you doing hanging around here?\" it said. \"Why aren\u0027t you out catching the one who did this?\" It was a stare he could identify at fifty paces just by the way it impacted with his back. Over the years, he\u0027d learned to ignore it. Mostly.\n \u0027You\u0027ll find it\u0027s just a little large to maneuver around.\" Dr. Shane stopped across from the workroom and pulled out her keys. \"That\u0027s why we moved it.\"\n While the workroom doors were bright yellow, the storeroom doors bordered on day-glo orange.\n \u0027What\u0027s with the color scheme?\" Celluci asked.\n Dr. Shane\u0027s head swiveled between the two sets of doors. \"I haven\u0027t,\" she said at last, forehead slightly puckered, \"the faintest idea.\"\n To Celluci\u0027s eyes the sarcophagus looked like a rectangular box of black rock. He had to actually run his fingers along the edge before he could find the seam where the top had been fitted into the sides. \"How can you tell that something like this is Sixteenth Dynasty?\" he asked, crouching down and peering in the open end.\n \u0027Mostly because the only other one ever found in this particular style was very definitely dated Sixteenth.\"\n \u0027But the coffin was Eighteenth?\" He could see faint marks where the coffin had rested.\n \u0027No doubt about it.\"\n \u0027Is that unusual? Mixing time periods?\"\n Dr. Shane leaned on the sarcophagus and crossed her arms. \"Well, we\u0027ve never run into it before, but that may be because we\u0027ve run into very few undisturbed grave sites. Usually, if we find a sarcophagus, the coffin is missing entirely.\"\n \u0027Hard to run away with one of these,\" Celluci muttered, straightening and having a look at the end panel. \"Any theories?\"\n \u0027On why this one was mixed?\" Dr. Shane shrugged. \"Maybe the family of the deceased was saving money.\"\n Celluci looked up and smiled. \"Got a good deal on it secondhand?\"\n Dr. Shane found herself smiling back. \"Perhaps.\"\n Moving the sliding panel into its grooves, Celluci let it gently down, then just as gently eased it up again. There was a three-inch lip on the inside that blocked the bottom edge. He frowned.\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\" Dr. Shane asked, leaning forward a little anxiously. Pretty much indestructible or not, this was still a three-thousand-year-old artifact.\n \u0027They might also have chosen this style because once inside, it\u0027d be the next thing to impossible to get out. There\u0027s no way to get a grip on this door and because it slides, brute force would do bugger all.\"\n \u0027Yes. But that\u0027s usually not a factor?\"\n \u0027No, of course not.\" He released the panel and stepped back. Maybe Dave was right. Maybe he was fixating on this nonexistent mummy. \"Just a random observation. You, uh, get used to throwing strange details together in this job.\"\n \u0027In my job, too.\"\n She really did have a terrific smile. And she smelled great. He recognized Chanel No. 5, the same cologne Vicki used. \"Look, it\u0027s?\" He checked his watch. \"? eleven forty-five. How about lunch?\"\n \u0027Lunch?\"\n \u0027You do eat, don\u0027t you?\"\n She thought about it for a moment, then she laughed. \"Yes, I do.\"\n \u0027Then it\u0027s lunch?\"\n \u0027I guess it is, Detective.\"\n \u0027Mike.\"\n \u0027Rachel.\"\n His grandmother had always said food was the fastest way to friendship. Of course, his grandmother was old country Italian and believed in no less than four courses for breakfast while what he had in mind was a little closer to a burger and fries. Still, he could ask Dr. Shane-Rachel-her opinion on the undead while they ate.\n The second time Celluci left the museum that day, he headed for the corner and a phone. Lunch had been? interesting. Dr. Rachel Shane was a fascinating woman; brilliant, self-assured, with a velvet glove over an iron core. Which made a nice change, he observed dryly to himself, because with Vicki the gloves were usually off. He liked her wry sense of humor; he enjoyed watching her hands sketch possibilities in the air while she talked. He\u0027d gotten her to tell him about Elias Rax, about his often single-minded pursuit of an idea, about his dedication to the museum. She\u0027d touched on his rivalry with Dr. Von Thorne and Celluci made a mental note to look into it. He hadn\u0027t brought up the mummy.\n The closest they\u0027d actually gotten to an analysis of the undead had been an animated discussion of old horror films. Her opinion of those had decided him against mentioning, in even a theoretical way, the idea that seemed to have possessed him.\n Possessed? He shoved his hands deep into his jacket pockets and hunched his shoulders against the chill wind. Let\u0027s come up with another word, shall we?\n When it came right down to it, there was only one person he could tell who\u0027d listen to everything he had to say before she told him that he\u0027d lost his mind.\n \u0027Nelson. Private investigations.\"\n \u0027Christ, Vicki, it\u0027s one seventeen in the afternoon. Don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re still asleep.\"\n \u0027You know, Celluci?\" She yawned audibly and stretched into a more comfortable position in the recliner. \"? you\u0027re beginning to sound like my mother.\"\n She heard him snort. \"You spend the night with Fitzroy?\"\n \u0027Not exactly.\" When she\u0027d finally gone to bed, having slept most of the day, she\u0027d had to leave the bedroom light on. Lying there in the dark, she couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that he was beside her again, lifeless and empty. What sleep she\u0027d managed to eventually get, had been fitful and dream filled. Just before dawn, she\u0027d called Henry. Although he\u0027d convinced her-and at the same time, she suspected, himself-that this morning at least he had no intention of giving his life to the sun, guilt about not actually being there had kept her awake until long after sunrise. She\u0027d been dozing off and on all day.\n \u0027Look, Vicki,\" Celluci took a deep breath, audible over the phone lines, \"what do you know about mummies?\"\n \u0027Well, mine\u0027s a pain in the butt.\" The silence didn\u0027t sound all that amused, so she continued. \"The ancient embalmed Egyptian kind or the monster movie matinee kind?\"\n \u0027Both.\"\n Vicki frowned at the receiver. Missing from that single word had been the arrogant self-confidence that usually colored everything Mike Celluci said. \"You\u0027re on the ROM case.\" She knew he was; all three papers had mentioned him as the investigating officer.\n \u0027Yeah.\"\n \u0027You want to tell me about it?\" Even at the height of their competitiveness, they\u0027d bounced ideas off each other, arguing them down to bare essentials, then rebuilding the case from the ground up.\n \u0027I think?\" He sighed and her frown deepened. \"? I\u0027m going to need to see your face.\"\n \u0027Now?\"\n \u0027No. I still work for a living. How about dinner? I\u0027ll buy.\"\n Shit, this is serious. She pushed her glasses up on her nose. \"Champion House at six?\"\n \u0027Five thirty. I\u0027ll meet you there.\"\n Vicki sat for a moment, staring down at the phone. She\u0027d never heard Celluci sound so out of his depth. \"Mummies?\" she said at last and headed for the pile of \"to be recycled\" newspapers in her office. Spreading them out on her weight bench, she scanned the articles on the recent deaths at the museum. Forty minutes later, she picked up a hand weight and absently began doing biceps curls. Her memory hadn\u0027t been faulty; according to Detective-Sergeant Michael Celluci, there was no mummy.\n It was cold and it was raining as he walked from Queen\u0027s Park back to his hotel, but then, it was October and it was Toronto. According to the ka of Dr. Rax, when the latter conditions were met, the former naturally followed. He decided that, for now, he would treat it as a new experience to be examined and endured, but that later, when his god had acquired more power, perhaps something could be done about the weather.\n It had been a most productive day and the day was not yet over.\n He had spent the morning sitting and weighing the currents of power eddying about the large room full of shouting men and women. Question period they called it. The name seemed apt, for although there were plenty of questions there seemed to be very few answers. He had been pleased to see that government-and those who sought positions in it-had not changed significantly in millennia. The provinces of Egypt had been very like the provinces of this new land, essentially autonomous and only nominally under the control of the central government. It was a system he understood and could work with.\n Amazed at how little both adult ka he had devoured knew of politics, he had convinced a scribe-now called a press secretary-to join him for food. After using barely enough power to ripple the surface of the man\u0027s mind, he had sat and listened to an outpouring of information, both professional and personal, about the Members of the Provincial Parliament that lasted almost two and a half hours. Taking the man\u0027s ka would have been faster, but until he consolidated his power he had no wish to leave a trail of bodies behind him. While he couldn\u0027t be stopped, neither did he wish to be delayed.\n Later this afternoon, he would meet with the man now called the Solicitor General. The Solicitor General controlled the police. The police were essentially a standing army. He would prepare the necessary spells and begin his empire from a position of strength.\n And then, having set the future in motion, there were loose ends that needed tying off; two ka still carried thoughts of him that must be erased.\n Vicki pushed a congealing mushroom around her plate and squinted at Celluci. The light levels in the restaurant were just barely high enough for her to see his face but nowhere near high enough if she actually wanted to pick up nuances of expression. She should have thought of that when she suggested the place and it infuriated her that she hadn\u0027t. Next time it\u0027s MacDonald\u0027s, right under the biggest block of fluorescent lights I can find.\n He\u0027d told her about the case while they ate, laying out the facts without opinions to color them; the groundwork had been laid and now it was time to cut to the chase.\n She watched him play with his teacup for a moment longer, the ceramic bowl looking absurdly small in his hand, then reached across the table and smacked him on the knuckle with one of her chopsticks. \"Shit or get off the pot,\" she suggested.\n Celluci grabbed for the chopstick and missed. \"And they say after dinner conversation is dead,\" he muttered, wiping sesame-lemon sauce off his hand. He stared down at the crumpled napkin, then up at her.\n It might have been the lack of light, but Vicki could\u0027ve sworn he looked tentative, and as far as she knew, Michael Celluci had never looked tentative in his life. When he started to speak, he even sounded tentative and Vicki got a cold feeling in the pit of her stomach.\n \u0027I told you how PC Trembley said there\u0027d been a mummy when I talked to her that morning?\"\n \u0027Yeah.\" Vicki wasn\u0027t sure she liked where this was heading. \"But everyone else said there wasn\u0027t, so she must\u0027ve been wrong.\"\n \u0027I don\u0027t think she was.\" He squared his shoulders and laid both palms flat on the table. \"I think she did see a mummy, and I think that it\u0027s responsible for both of the deaths at the museum.\"\n A mummy? Lurching around downtown Toronto, trailing rotting bandages and inducing heart attacks? In this day and age the entire concept was ludicrous. Of course, so was a nerd with a pentagram in his living room, a family of werewolves raising sheep outside London, and, when you got right down to it, so was the concept of Henry Fitzroy, bastard son of Henry the VIII, vampire and romance writer. Vicki adjusted her glasses and leaned forward, elbows propped, chin on hands. Life used to be so much simpler. \"Tell me,\" she sighed.\n Celluci began ticking points off on his fingers. \"Everyone we talked to, and I mean everyone, was surprised that an empty sarcophagus had been resealed. The only item that the intruder destroyed has been identified as part of a powerful spell. The only items stolen were a suit of clothes and a pair of shoes.\" He took a deep breath. \"I don\u0027t think the sarcophagus was empty. I think Reid Ellis was poking around where he shouldn\u0027t have, woke something up, and died for it. I think the creature took a little time to regain its strength and then got up out of the coffin and destroyed its wrapping and the spell that had held it. I think Dr. Rax interrupted, was overpowered, and killed. I think that the naked mummy then dressed itself in the doctor\u0027s suit and shoes and left the building. I think I\u0027m losing my mind and I want you to tell me I\u0027m not.\"\n Vicki sat back, caught their waiter\u0027s attention, and indicated they wanted the bill. Then she adjusted her glasses again although they didn\u0027t really need it. \"I think,\" she said slowly, fighting a strong sense of deja vu-it had to be coincidence that both of the men in her life currently thought they were going crazy, \"that you\u0027re one of the sanest people I\u0027ve ever met. But are you positive that your recent? experiences aren\u0027t causing you to jump to supernatural conclusions?\"\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\"\n \u0027Why doesn\u0027t anyone at the museum remember a mummy?\"\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\"\n \u0027And if there is a mummy, how and why is it killing people?\"\n \u0027Goddamnit, Vicki! How the hell am I supposed to know that?\" He scowled down at the bill, threw two twenties on the table, and stood. The waiter beat a hasty retreat. \"I\u0027m working on a gut feeling, circumstantial evidence, and I don\u0027t know what the fuck to do.\"\n At least he didn\u0027t sound tentative anymore. \"Talk to Trembley.\"\n He blinked. \"What?\"\n Vicki grinned and got to her feet. \"Talk to Trembley,\" she repeated. \"Go down to 52 Division and see if she actually saw a mummy.

Now, at last, the waiting had come to an end. Brought to the Egyptology Department of Toronto\u0027s Royal Ontario Museum, the seals and spells that imprisoned him chipped away by his discoverers, he reached forth to claim the minds and souls of the unsuspecting city dwellers, to begin building an empire for himself and his god. And only three people had even a hint that anything was wrong. \n For Henry Fitzroy, 450-year-old vampire, it began with a haunting, inescapable image of the sun, a terrifying symbol of death to one such as he. Fearing for his sanity, he called upon his sometime-lover and comrade in supernatural investigations, ex-cop Vicki Nelson, for help. And even as the two struggled to cope with Henry\u0027s obsession, Vicki\u0027s closest friend and former partner, Police Detective Mike Celluci was following up on two mysterious deaths at the museum, certain he was looking at murders not accidents - and equally convinced that the killer was a mummy brought back from the dead!\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-lines-vicki-nelson-3.jpg","author":"Tanya Huff","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/blood-lines-vicki-nelson-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:38:01 PM"}}
