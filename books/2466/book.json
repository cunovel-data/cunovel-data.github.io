Now, at last, the waiting had come to an end. Brought to the Egyptology Department of Toronto\u0027s Royal Ontario Museum, the seals and spells that imprisoned him chipped away by his discoverers, he reached forth to claim the minds and souls of the unsuspecting city dwellers, to begin building an empire for himself and his god.

And even as the two struggled to cope with Henry\u0027s obsession, Vicki\u0027s closest friend and former partner, Police Detective Mike Celluci was following up on two mysterious deaths at the museum, certain he was looking at murders not accidents - and equally convinced that the killer was a mummy brought back from the dead!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/blood-lines-vicki-nelson-3.jpg","author":"Tanya Huff","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":16,"category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
