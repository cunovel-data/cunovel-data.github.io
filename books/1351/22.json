{"id":13948,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. LORD DE GUEST AT HOME.","content":"Illustration he earl and John Eames, after their escape from the bull, walked up to the Manor House together. \"You can write a note to your mother, and I\u0027ll send it by one of the boys,\" said the earl. This was his lordship\u0027s answer when Eames declined to dine at the Manor House, because he would be expected home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027m so badly off for clothes, my lord,\" pleaded Johnny. \"I tore my trowsers in the hedge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There will be nobody there beside us two and Dr. Crofts. The doctor will forgive you when he hears the story; and as for me, I didn\u0027t care if you hadn\u0027t a stitch to your back. You\u0027ll have company back to Guestwick, so come along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Eames had no further excuse to offer, and therefore did as he was bidden. He was by no means as much at home with the earl now as during those minutes of the combat. He would rather have gone home, being somewhat ashamed of being seen in his present tattered and bare-headed condition by the servants of the house; and moreover, his mind would sometimes revert to the scene which had taken place in the garden at Allington. But he found himself obliged to obey the earl, and so he walked on with him through the woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n The earl did not say very much, being tired and somewhat thoughtful. In what little he did say he seemed to be specially hurt by the ingratitude of the bull towards himself. \"I never teased him, or annoyed him in any way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose they are dangerous beasts?\" said Eames. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not a bit of it, if they\u0027re properly treated. It must have been my handkerchief, I suppose. I remember that I did blow my nose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He hardly said a word in the way of thanks to his assistant. \"Where should I have been if you had not come to me?\" he had exclaimed immediately after his deliverance; but having said that he didn\u0027t think it necessary to say much more to Eames. But he made himself very pleasant, and by the time he had reached the house his companion was almost glad that he had been forced to dine at the Manor House. \"And now we\u0027ll have a drink,\" said the earl. \"I don\u0027t know how you feel, but I never was so thirsty in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two servants immediately showed themselves, and evinced some surprise at Johnny\u0027s appearance. \"Has the gentleman hurt hisself, my lord?\" asked the butler, looking at the blood upon our friend\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has hurt his trowsers the worst, I believe,\" said the earl. \"And if he was to put on any of mine they\u0027d be too short and too big, wouldn\u0027t they? I am sorry you should be so uncomfortable, but you mustn\u0027t mind it for once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mind it a bit,\" said Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t,\" said the earl. \"Mr. Eames is going to dine here, Vickers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, my lord.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And his hat is down in the middle of the nineteen acres. Let three or four men go for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three or four men, my lord!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,—three or four men. There\u0027s something gone wrong with that bull. And you must get a boy with a pony to take a note into Guestwick, to Mrs. Eames. Oh dear, I\u0027m better now,\" and he put down the tumbler from which he\u0027d been drinking. \"Write your note here, and then we\u0027ll go and see my pet pheasants before dinner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Vickers and the footman knew that something had happened of much moment, for the earl was usually very particular about his dinner-table. He expected every guest who sat there to be dressed in such guise as the fashion of the day demanded; and he himself, though his morning costume was by no means brilliant, never dined, even when alone, without having put himself into a suit of black, with a white cravat, and having exchanged the old silver hunting-watch which he carried during the day tied round his neck by a bit of old ribbon, for a small gold watch, with a chain and seals, which in the evening always dangled over his waistcoat. Dr. Gruffen had once been asked to dinner at Guestwick Manor. \"Just a bachelor\u0027s chop,\" said the earl; \"for there\u0027s nobody at home but myself.\" Whereupon Dr. Gruffen had come in coloured trowsers,—and had never again been asked to dine at Guestwick Manor. All this Vickers knew well; and now his lordship had brought young Eames home to dine with him with his clothes all hanging about him in a manner which Vickers declared in the servants\u0027 hall wasn\u0027t more than half decent. Therefore, they all knew that something very particular must have happened. \"It\u0027s some trouble about the bull, I know,\" said Vickers;—\"but bless you, the bull couldn\u0027t have tore his things in that way!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Eames wrote his note, in which he told his mother that he had had an adventure with Lord De Guest, and that his lordship had insisted on bringing him home to dinner. \"I have torn my trowsers all to pieces,\" he added in a postscript, \"and have lost my hat. Everything else is all right.\" He was not aware that the earl also sent a short note to Mrs. Eames. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear Madam [ran the earl\u0027s note],— \\n\\n \\n\\n Your son has, under Providence, probably saved my life. I will leave the story for him to tell. He has been good enough to accompany me home, and will return to Guestwick after dinner with Dr. Crofts, who dines here. I congratulate you on having a son with so much cool courage and good feeling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Your very faithful servant, \\n\\n \\n\\n De Guest. \\n\\n \\n\\n Guestwick Manor, \\n\\n Thursday, October, 186—. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n And then they went to see the pheasants. \"Now, I\u0027ll tell you what,\" said the earl. \"I advise you to take to shooting. It\u0027s the amusement of a gentleman when a man chances to have the command of game.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027m always up in London.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re not. You\u0027re not up in London now. You always have your holidays. If you choose to try it, I\u0027ll see that you have shooting enough while you\u0027re here. It\u0027s better than going to sleep under the trees. Ha, ha, ha! I wonder what made you lay yourself down there. You hadn\u0027t been fighting a bull that day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my lord. I hadn\u0027t seen the bull then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well; you think of what I\u0027ve been saying. When I say a thing, I mean it. You shall have shooting enough, if you have a mind to try it.\" Then they looked at the pheasants, and pottered about the place till the earl said it was time to dress for dinner. \"That\u0027s hard upon you, isn\u0027t it?\" said he. \"But, at any rate, you can wash your hands, and get rid of the blood. I\u0027ll be down in the little drawing-room five minutes before seven, and I suppose I\u0027ll find you there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At five minutes before seven Lord De Guest came into the small drawing-room, and found Johnny seated there, with a book before him. The earl was a little fussy, and showed by his manner that he was not quite at his ease, as some men do when they have any piece of work on hand which is not customary to them. He held something in his hand, and shuffled a little as he made his way up the room. He was dressed, as usual, in black; but his gold chain was not, as usual, dangling over his waistcoat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eames,\" he said, \"I want you to accept a little present from me,—just as a memorial of our affair with the bull. It will make you think of it sometimes, when I\u0027m perhaps gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, my lord—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s my own watch, that I have been wearing for some time; but I\u0027ve got another;—two or three, I believe, somewhere upstairs. You mustn\u0027t refuse me. I can\u0027t bear being refused. There are two or three little seals, too, which I have worn. I have taken off the one with my arms, because that\u0027s of no use to you, and it is to me. It doesn\u0027t want a key, but winds up at the handle, in this way,\" and the earl proceeded to explain the nature of the toy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord, you think too much of what happened to-day,\" said Eames, stammering. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t; I think very little about it. I know what I think of. Put the watch in your pocket before the doctor comes. There; I hear his horse. Why didn\u0027t he drive over, and then he could have taken you back?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can walk very well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make that all right. The servant shall ride Crofts\u0027 horse, and bring back the little phaeton. How d\u0027you do, doctor? You know Eames, I suppose? You needn\u0027t look at him in that way. His leg is not broken; it\u0027s only his trowsers.\" And then the earl told the story of the bull. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Johnny will become quite a hero in town,\" said Crofts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I fear he\u0027ll get the most of the credit; and yet I was at it twice as long as he was. I\u0027ll tell you what, young men, when I got to that gate I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d breath enough left in me to get over it. It\u0027s all very well jumping into a hedge when you\u0027re only two-and-twenty; but when a man comes to be sixty he likes to take his time about such things. Dinner ready, is it? So am I. I quite forgot that mutton chop of yours to-day, doctor. But I suppose a man may eat a good dinner after a fight with a bull?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The evening passed by without any very pleasurable excitement, and I regret to say that the earl went fast to sleep in the drawing-room as soon as he had swallowed his cup of coffee. During dinner he had been very courteous to both his guests, but towards Eames he had used a good-humoured and almost affectionate familiarity. He had quizzed him for having been found asleep under the tree, telling Crofts that he had looked very forlorn,—\"So that I haven\u0027t a doubt about his being in love,\" said the earl. And he had asked Johnny to tell the name of the fair one, bringing up the remnants of his half-forgotten classicalities to bear out the joke. \"If I am to take more of the severe Falernian,\" said he, laying his hand on the decanter of port, \"I must know the lady\u0027s name. Whoever she be, I\u0027m well sure you need not blush for her. What! you refuse to tell! Then I\u0027ll drink no more.\" And so the earl had walked out of the dining-room; but not till he had perceived by his guest\u0027s cheeks that the joke had been too true to be pleasant. As he went, however, he leaned with his hand on Eames\u0027s shoulder, and the servants looking on saw that the young man was to be a favourite. \"He\u0027ll make him his heir,\" said Vickers. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder a bit if he don\u0027t make him his heir.\" But to this the footman objected, endeavouring to prove to Mr. Vickers that, in accordance with the law of the land, his lordship\u0027s second cousin, once removed, whom the earl had never seen, but whom he was supposed to hate, must be his heir. \"A hearl can never choose his own heir, like you or me,\" said the footman, laying down the law. \"Can\u0027t he though really, now? That\u0027s very hard on him; isn\u0027t it?\" said the pretty housemaid. \"Psha,\" said Vickers: \"you know nothing about it. My lord could make young Eames his heir to-morrow; that is, the heir of his property. He couldn\u0027t make him a hearl, because that must go to the heirs of his body. As to his leaving him the place here, I don\u0027t just know how that\u0027d be; and I\u0027m sure Richard don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But suppose he hasn\u0027t got any heirs of his body?\" asked the pretty housemaid, who was rather fond of putting down Mr. Vickers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He must have heirs of his body,\" said the butler. \"Everybody has \u0027em. If a man don\u0027t know \u0027em himself, the law finds \u0027em out.\" And then Mr. Vickers walked away, avoiding further dispute. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime, the earl was asleep upstairs, and the two young men from Guestwick did not find that they could amuse themselves with any satisfaction. Each took up a book; but there are times at which a man is quite unable to read, and when a book is only a cover for his idleness or dulness. At last, Dr. Crofts suggested, in a whisper, that they might as well begin to think of going home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh; yes; what?\" said the earl: \"I\u0027m not asleep.\" In answer to which the doctor said that he thought he\u0027d go home, if his lordship would let him order his horse. But the earl was again fast bound in slumber, and took no further notice of the proposition. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps we could get off without waking him,\" suggested Eames, in a whisper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh; what?\" said the earl. So they both resumed their books, and submitted themselves to their martyrdom for a further period of fifteen minutes. At the expiration of that time, the footman brought in tea. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh, what? tea!\" said the earl. \"Yes, we\u0027ll have a little tea. I\u0027ve heard every word you\u0027ve been saying.\" It was that assertion on the part of the earl which always made Lady Julia so angry. \"You cannot have heard what I have been saying, Theodore, because I have said nothing,\" she would reply. \"But I should have heard it if you had,\" the earl would rejoin, snappishly. On the present occasion neither Crofts nor Eames contradicted him, and he took his tea and swallowed it while still three parts asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you\u0027ll allow me, my lord, I think I\u0027ll order my horse,\" said the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; horse—yes—\" said the earl, nodding. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what are you to do, Eames, if I ride?\" said the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll walk,\" whispered Eames, in his very lowest voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What—what—what?\" said the earl, jumping up on his feet. \"Oh, ah, yes; going away, are you? I suppose you might as well, as sit here and see me sleeping. But, doctor—I didn\u0027t snore, did I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only occasionally.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not loud, did I? Come, Eames, did I snore loud?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my lord, you did snore rather loud two or three times.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did I?\" said the earl, in a voice of great disappointment. \"And yet, do you know, I heard every word you said.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The small phaeton had been already ordered, and the two young men started back to Guestwick together, a servant from the house riding the doctor\u0027s horse behind them. \"Look here, Eames,\" said the earl, as they parted on the steps of the hall door. \"You\u0027re going back to town the day after to-morrow, you say, so I shan\u0027t see you again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, my lord,\" said Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look you here, now. I shall be up for the Cattle-show before Christmas. You must dine with me at my hotel, on the twenty-second of December, Pawkins\u0027s, in Jermyn Street; seven o\u0027clock, sharp. Mind you do not forget, now. Put it down in your pocket-book when you get home. Good-by, doctor; good-by. I see I must stick to that mutton chop in the middle of the day.\" And then they drove off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll make him his heir for certain,\" said Vickers to himself, as he slowly returned to his own quarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You were returning from Allington, I suppose,\" said Crofts, \"when you came across Lord De Guest and the bull?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes: I just walked over to say good-by to them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you find them all well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I only saw one. The other two were out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Dale, was it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; it was Lily.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sitting alone, thinking of her fine London lover, of course? I suppose we ought to look upon her as a very lucky girl. I have no doubt she thinks herself so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" said Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe he\u0027s a very good young man,\" said the doctor; \"but I can\u0027t say I quite liked his manner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think not,\" said Johnny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But then in all probability he did not like mine a bit better, or perhaps yours either. And if so it\u0027s all fair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see that it\u0027s a bit fair. He\u0027s a snob,\" said Eames; \"and I don\u0027t believe that I am.\" He had taken a glass or two of the earl\u0027s \"severe Falernian,\" and was disposed to a more generous confidence, and perhaps also to stronger language, than might otherwise have been the case. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I don\u0027t think he is a snob,\" said Crofts. \"Had he been so, Mrs. Dale would have perceived it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll see,\" said Johnny, touching up the earl\u0027s horse with energy as he spoke. \"You\u0027ll see. A man who gives himself airs is a snob; and he gives himself airs. And I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s a straightforward fellow. It was a bad day for us all when he came among them at Allington.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say that I see that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do. But mind, I haven\u0027t spoken a word of this to any one. And I don\u0027t mean. What would be the good? I suppose she must marry him now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course she must.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And be wretched all her life. Oh-h-h-h!\" and he muttered a deep groan. \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Crofts. He is going to take the sweetest girl out of this country that ever was in it, and he don\u0027t deserve her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think she can be compared to her sister,\" said Crofts slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What; not Lily?\" said Eames, as though the proposition made by the doctor were one that could not hold water for a minute. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have always thought that Bell was the more admired of the two,\" said Crofts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" said Eames. \"I have never yet set my eyes on any human creature whom I thought so beautiful as Lily Dale. And now that beast is going to marry her! I\u0027ll tell you what, Crofts; I\u0027ll manage to pick a quarrel with him yet.\" Whereupon the doctor, seeing the nature of the complaint from which his companion was suffering, said nothing more, either about Lily or about Bell. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon after this Eames was at his own door, and was received there by his mother and sister with all the enthusiasm due to a hero. \"He has saved the earl\u0027s life!\" Mrs. Eames had exclaimed to her daughter on reading Lord De Guest\u0027s note. \"Oh, goodness!\" and she threw herself back upon the sofa almost in a fainting condition. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Saved Lord De Guest\u0027s life!\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—under Providence,\" said Mrs. Eames, as though that latter fact added much to her son\u0027s good deed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But how did he do it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By cool courage and good feeling—so his lordship says. But I wonder how he really did do it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whatever way it was, he\u0027s torn all his clothes and lost his hat,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care a bit about that,\" said Mrs. Eames. \"I wonder whether the earl has any interest at the Income-tax. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a thing it would be if he could get Johnny a step. It would be seventy pounds a year at once. He was quite right to stay and dine when his lordship asked him. And so Dr. Crofts is there. It couldn\u0027t have been anything in the doctoring way, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I should say not; because of what he says of his trowsers.\" And so the two ladies were obliged to wait for John\u0027s return. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you do it, John?\" said his mother, embracing him, as soon as the door was opened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you save the earl\u0027s life?\" said Mary, who was standing behind her mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would his lordship really have been killed, if it had not been for you?\" asked Mrs. Eames. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And was he very much hurt?\" asked Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, bother,\" said Johnny, on whom the results of the day\u0027s work, together with the earl\u0027s Falernian, had made some still remaining impression. On ordinary occasions, Mrs. Eames would have felt hurt at being so answered by her son; but at the present moment she regarded him as standing so high in general favour that she took no offence. \"Oh, Johnny, do tell us. Of course we must be very anxious to know it all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing to tell, except that a bull ran at the earl, as I was going by; so I went into the field and helped him, and then he made me stay and dine with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But his lordship says that you saved his life,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Under Providence,\" added their mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At any rate, he has given me a gold watch and chain,\" said Johnny, drawing the present out of his pocket. \"I wanted a watch badly. All the same, I didn\u0027t like taking it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would have been very wrong to refuse,\" said his mother. \"And I am so glad you have been so fortunate. And look here, Johnny: when a friend like that comes in your way, don\u0027t turn your back on him.\" Then, at last, he thawed beneath their kindness, and told them the whole of the story. I fear that in recounting the earl\u0027s efforts with the spud, he hardly spoke of his patron with all that deference which would have been appropriate. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2751/75802.html","bookId":1351,"book":{"id":1351,"title":"The Small House at Allington","description":"简介： Illustration f course there was a Great House at Allington.
