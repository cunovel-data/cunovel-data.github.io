On pain of pain.”\\n\\n Carrot peered over Colon\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n “What\u0027s a virgin?” he said.\\n\\n “An unmarried girl,” said Colon quickly.\\n\\n “What, like my friend Reel?” said Carrot, horrified.\\n\\n “Well, no,” said Colon.\\n\\n “She\u0027s not married, you know. None of Mrs Palm\u0027s girls are married.”\\n\\n “Well, yes,” said Colon.\\n\\n “Well, then,” said Carrot, with an air of finality. “We\u0027re not having any of that kind of thing, I hope.”\\n\\n “People won\u0027t stand for it,” said Colon. “You mark my words.”\\n\\n The guards stepped back, out of range of Carrot\u0027s rising wrath.\\n\\n “They can please themselves,” said the senior guard. “But if you don\u0027t proclaim it, you can try explaining things to His Majesty.”\\n\\n They hurried off.\\n\\n Nobby darted out into the street. “Dragon on your vest!” he shouted. “If your old mum knew about this she\u0027d turn in her vat, you goin\u0027 around with a dragon on your vest!”\\n\\n Colon wandered back to the table and spread out the scroll.\\n\\n “Bad business,” he mumbled.\\n\\n “It\u0027s already killed people,” said Carrot. “Contrary to sixteen separate Acts in Council.”\\n\\n “Well, yes. But that was just like, you know, the hurly-burly of this and that,” said Colon. “Not that it wasn\u0027t bad, I mean, but people sort of participating, just handing over some slip of a girl and standing round watching as if it\u0027s all proper and legal, that\u0027s much worse.”\\n\\n “I reckon it all depends on your point of view,” said Nobby thoughtfully.\\n\\n “What d\u0027you mean?”\\n\\n “Well, from the point of view of someone being burned alive, it probably doesn\u0027t matter much,” said Nobby philosophically.\\n\\n “People won\u0027t stand for it, I said,” said Colon, ignoring this. “You\u0027ll see. They\u0027ll march on the palace, and what will the dragon do then, eh?”\\n\\n “Burn \u0027em all,” said Nobby promptly.\\n\\n Colon looked puzzled. “It wouldn\u0027t do that, would it?” he said.\\n\\n “Don\u0027t see what\u0027s to prevent it, do you?” said Nobby. He glanced out of the doorway. “He was a good lad, that boy. Used to run errands for my grandad. Who\u0027d have thought he\u0027d go around with a dragon on his chest ...”\\n\\n “What are we going to do, Sergeant?” said Carrot.\\n\\n “I don\u0027t want to be burned alive,” said Sergeant Colon. “My wife\u0027d give me hell. So I suppose we\u0027ve got to wossname, proclaim it. But don\u0027t worry, lad,” he said, patting Carrot on one muscular arm and repeating, as if he hadn\u0027t quite believed himself the first time, “it won\u0027t come to that. People\u0027ll never stand for it.”\\n\\n Lady Ramkin ran her hands over Errol\u0027s body.\\n\\n “Damned if I know what\u0027s going on in there,” she said. The little dragon tried to lick her face. “What\u0027s he been eating?”\\n\\n “The last thing, I think, was a kettle,” said Vimes.\\n\\n “A kettle of what?”\\n\\n “No. A kettle. A black thing with a handle and spout. He sniffed it for ages, then he ate it.”\\n\\n Enrol grinned weakly at him, and belched. They both ducked.\\n\\n “Oh, and then we found him eating soot out of the chimney,” Vimes went on, as their heads rose again over the railings.\\n\\n They leaned back over the reinforced bunker that was one of Lady Ramkin\u0027s sickbay pens. It had to be reinforced. Usually one of the first things a sick dragon did was lose control of its digestive processes.\\n\\n “He doesn\u0027t look sick, exactly,” she said. “Just fat.”\\n\\n “He whines a lot. And you can sort of see things moving under his skin. You know what I think? You know you said they can rearrange their digestive system?”\\n\\n “Oh, yes. All the stomachs and pancreatic crackers can be hooked up in various ways, you see. To take advantage-”\\n\\n “Of whatever they can find to make flame with,” said Vimes. “Yes. I think he\u0027s trying to make some sort of very hot flame. He wants to challenge the big dragon. Every time it takes to the air he just sits there whining.”\\n\\n “And doesn\u0027t explode?”\\n\\n “Not that we\u0027ve noticed. I mean, I\u0027m sure if he did, we\u0027d spot it.”\\n\\n “He just eats indiscriminately?”\\n\\n “Hard to be sure. He sniffs everything, and eats most things. Two gallons of lamp oil, for example. Anyway, I can\u0027t leave him down there. We can\u0027t look after him properly. It\u0027s not as if we need to find out where the dragon is now,” he added bitterly.\\n\\n “I think you\u0027re being a bit silly about all this,” she said, leading the way back to the house.\\n\\n “Silly? I was sacked in front of all those people!”\\n\\n “Yes, but it was all a misunderstanding, I\u0027m sure.”\\n\\n “I didn\u0027t misunderstand it!”\\n\\n “Well, I think you\u0027re just upset because you\u0027re impotent.”\\n\\n Vimes\u0027s eyes bulged. “Whee?” he said.\\n\\n “Against the dragon,” Lady Ramkin went on, quite unconcerned. “You can\u0027t do anything about it.”\\n\\n “I reckon this damn city and the dragon just about deserve one another,” said Vimes.\\n\\n “People are frightened. You can\u0027t expect much of people when they\u0027re so frightened.” She touched him gingerly on his arm. It was like watching an industrial robot being expertly manipulated to grasp an egg gently.\\n\\n “Not everyone\u0027s as brave as you,” she added, timidly.\\n\\n “Me?”\\n\\n “The other week. When you stopped them killing my dragons.”\\n\\n “Oh, that. That\u0027s not bravery. Anyway, that was just people. People are easier. I\u0027ll tell you one thing for nothing, I\u0027m not looking up that dragon\u0027s nose again. I wake up at days thinking about that.”\\n\\n “Oh.” She seemed deflated. “Well, if you\u0027re sure . . . I\u0027ve got a lot of friends, you know. If you need any help, you\u0027ve only got to say. The Duke of Sto Helit is looking for a guard captain, I\u0027m sure. I\u0027ll write you a letter. You\u0027ll like them, they\u0027re a very nice young couple.”\\n\\n “I\u0027m not sure what I shall do next,” said Vimes, more gruffly than he intended. “I\u0027m considering one or two offers.”\\n\\n “Well, of course. I\u0027m sure you know best.”\\n\\n Vimes nodded.\\n\\n Lady Ramkin twisted her handkerchief round and round in her hands.\\n\\n “Well, then,” she said.\\n\\n “Well,” said Vimes.\\n\\n “I, er, expect you\u0027ll be wanting to be off, then.”\\n\\n “Yes, I expect I had better be going.”\\n\\n There was a pause. Then they both spoke at once.\\n\\n “It\u0027s been very-”\\n\\n “I\u0027d just like to say-”\\n\\n “Sorry.”\\n\\n “Sorry.”\\n\\n “No, you were speaking.”\\n\\n “No, sorry, you were saying?”\\n\\n “Oh.” Vimes hesitated. “I\u0027ll be off, then.”\\n\\n “Oh. Yes.” Lady Ramkin gave him a washed-out smile. “Can\u0027t keep all these offers waiting, can you,” she said.\\n\\n She thrust out a hand. Vimes shook it carefully.\\n\\n “So I\u0027ll just be going, then,” he said.\\n\\n “Do call again,” said Lady Ramkin, more coldly, “if you are ever in this area. And so on. I\u0027m sure Errol would like to see you.”\\n\\n “Yes. Well. Goodbye, then.”\\n\\n “Goodbye, Captain Vimes.”\\n\\n He stumbled out of the door and walked hurriedly down the dark, overgrown path. He could feel her gaze on the back of his neck as he did so or, at least, he told himself that he could. She\u0027d be standing in the doorway, nearly blocking out the light. Just watching me. But I\u0027m not going to look back, he thought. That would be a really silly thing to do. I mean, she\u0027s a lovely person, she\u0027s got a lot of common sense and an enormous personality, but really . . .\\n\\n I\u0027m not going to look back, even if she stands there while I walk all the way down the street. Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.\\n\\n So when he heard the door shut when he was only halfway down the drive he suddenly felt very, very angry, as if he had just been robbed.\\n\\n He stood still and clasped and unclasped his hands in the darkness. He wasn\u0027t Captain Vimes any more, he was Citizen Vimes, which meant that he could do things he\u0027d once never dreamt of doing. Perhaps he could go and smash some windows.\\n\\n No, that wouldn\u0027t be any good. He wanted more than that. To get rid of that bloody dragon, to get his job back, to get his hands on whoever was behind all this, to forget himself just once and hit someone until he was exhausted . . .\\n\\n He stared at nothing. Down below the city was a mass of smoke and steam. He wasn\u0027t thinking of that, though.\\n\\n He was thinking of a running man. And, further back in the fuddled mists of his life, a boy running to keep up.\\n\\n And under his breath he said, “Any of them get out?”\\n\\n Sergeant Colon finished the proclamation and looked around at the hostile crowd.\\n\\n “Don\u0027t blame me,” he said. “I just read the things. I don\u0027t write \u0027em.”\\n\\n “That\u0027s human sacrifice, that is,” said someone.\\n\\n “There\u0027s nothing wrong with human sacrifice,” said a priest.\\n\\n “Ah, per say, ” said the first speaker quickly. “For proper religious reasons. And using condemned criminals and so on.[19] But that\u0027s different from bunging someone to a dragon just because it\u0027s feeling peckish.”\\n\\n “That\u0027s the spirit!” said Sergeant Colon.\\n\\n “Taxes is one thing, but eating people is another.”\\n\\n “Well said!”\\n\\n “If we all say we won\u0027t put up with it, what can the dragon do?”\\n\\n Nobby opened his mouth. Colon clamped a hand over it and raised a triumphant fist in the air.\\n\\n “It\u0027s just what I\u0027ve always said,” he said. “The people united can never be ignited!”\\n\\n There was a ragged cheer.\\n\\n “Hang on a minute,” said a small man, slowly. “As far as we know, the dragon\u0027s only good at one thing. It flies around the city setting fire to people. I\u0027m not actually certain what is being proposed that would stop it doing this.”\\n\\n “Yes, but if we all protest-” said the first speaker, his voice modulated with uncertainty.\\n\\n “It can\u0027t burn everybody, ” said Colon. He decided to play his new ace again and added, proudly, “The people united can never be ignited!” There was rather less of a cheer this time. People were reserving their energy for worrying.\\n\\n “I\u0027m not exactly sure I understand why not. Why can\u0027t it burn everyone and fly off to another city?”\\n\\n “Because ...”\\n\\n “The hoard,” said Colon. “It needs people to bring it treasure.”\\n\\n “Yeah.”\\n\\n “Well, maybe, but how many, exactly?”\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “How many people? Out of the whole city, I mean. Perhaps it won\u0027t need to burn the whole city down, just some bits. Do we know what bits?”\\n\\n “Look, this is getting silly,” said the first speaker. “If we go around looking at the problems the whole time, we\u0027ll never do anything.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-38.html","bookId":1627,"book":{"id":1627,"title":"Guards!
