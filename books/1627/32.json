The fog rolled in, in a slow, yellow-edged waterfall. “We reckon it must of flown away,” said Colon\u0027s voice, behind him. Vimes stared up into the heavy, rolling clouds. “Hope it clears up for the coronation,” Colon went on, in a worried voice. “You all right, sir?” It hasn\u0027t flown away, Vimes thought. Why should it fly away? We can\u0027t hurt it, and it\u0027s got everything it wants right here. It\u0027s up there somewhere. “You all right, sir?” Colon repeated. It\u0027s got to be up high somewhere, in the fog. There\u0027s all kinds of towers and things. “What time\u0027s the coronation, Sergeant?” he said. “Noon, sir. And Mr Wonse has sent a message about how you\u0027re to be in your best armour among all the civic leaders, sir.” “Oh, has he?” “And Sergeant Hummock and the day squad will be lining the route, sir.” “What with?” said Vimes vaguely, watching the skies. “Sorry, sir?” Vimes squinted upwards to get a better view of the roof. “Hmm?” he said. “I said they\u0027ll be lining the route, sir,” said Sergeant Colon. “It\u0027s up there, Sergeant,” said Vimes. “I can practically smell it.” “Yes, sir,” said Colon obediently. “It\u0027s deciding what to do next.” “Yes, sir?” “They\u0027re not unintelligent, you know. They just don\u0027t think like us.” “Yes, sir.” “So be damned to any lining of the route. I want you three up on roofs, understand?” “Yes, si-what?” “Up on the roofs. Up high. When it makes its move, I want us to be the first to know.” Colon tried to indicate by his expression that he didn\u0027t. “Do you think that\u0027s a good idea, sir?” he ventured. Vimes gave him a blank look. “Yes, Sergeant, I do. It was one of mine,” he said coldly. “Now go and see toil.” When he was left to himself Vimes washed and shaved in cold water, and then rummaged in his campaign chest until he unearthed his ceremonial breastplate and red cloak. Well, the cloak had been red once, and still was, here and there, although most of it resembled a small net used very successfully for catching moths. There was also a helmet, defiantly without plumes, from which the molecule-thick gold leaf had long ago peeled. He\u0027d started saving up for a new cloak, once. Whatever had happened to the money? There was no-one in the guardroom. Errol lay in the wreckage of the fourth fruit box Nobby had scrounged for him. The rest had all been eaten, or had dissolved. In the warm silence the everlasting rumbling of his stomach sounded especially loud. Occasionally he whimpered. “What\u0027s up with you, boy?” he said. The door creaked open. Carrot came in, saw Vines hunkered down by the ravaged box, and saluted. “We\u0027re a bit worried about him, Captain,” he volunteered. “He hasn\u0027t eaten his coal. Just lies there twitching and whining all the time. You don\u0027t think something\u0027s wrong with him, do you?” “Possibly,” said Vimes. “But having something wrong with them is quite normal for a dragon. They always get over it. One way or another.” Errol gave him a mournful look and closed his eyes again. Vimes pulled his scrap of blanket over him. There was a squeak. He fished around beside the dragon\u0027s shivering body, pulled out a small rubber hippo, stared at it in surprise and then gave it one or two experimental squeezes. “I thought it would be something for him to play with,” said Carrot, slightly shamefaced. “You bought him a little toy?” “Yes, sir.” “What a kind thought.” Vimes hoped Carrot hadn\u0027t noticed the fluffy ball tucked into the back of the box. It had been quite expensive. He left the two of them and stepped into the outside world. There was even more bunting now. People were beginning to line the main streets, even though there were hours to wait. It was still very depressing. He felt an appetite for once, one that it\u0027d take more than a drink or two to satisfy. He strolled along for breakfast at Harga\u0027s House of Ribs, the habit of years, and got another unpleasant surprise. Normally the only decoration in there was on Sham Harga\u0027s vest and the food was good solid stuff for a cold morning, all calories and fat and protein and maybe a vitamin crying softly because it was all alone. Now laboriously-made paper streamers criss-crossed the room and he was confronted with a crayonned menu in which the words “Coronasion” and “Royall” figured somewhere on every crooked line. Vimes pointed wearily at the top of the menu. “What\u0027s this?” he said. Harga peered at it. They were alone in the grease-walled cafe. “It says \u0027Bye Royarl Appointmente\u0027, Captain,” he said proudly. “What\u0027s it mean?” Harga scratched his head with a ladle. “What it means is,” he said, “if the king comes in here, he\u0027ll like it.” “Have you got anything that isn\u0027t too aristocratic for me to eat, then?” said Vimes sourly, and settled for a slice of plebeian fried bread and a proletarian steak cooked so rare you could still hear it bray. Vimes ate it at the counter. A vague scraping noise disturbed his thoughts. “What\u0027re you doing?” he said. Harga looked up guiltily from his work behind the counter. “Nothing, Cap\u0027n,” he said. He tried to hide the evidence behind him when Vimes glared over the knife-chewed woodwork. “Come on, Sham. You can show me.” Harga\u0027s beefy hands came reluctantly into view. “I was only scraping the old fat out of the pan,” he mumbled. “I see. And how long have we known each other, Sham?” said Vimes, with terrible kindness. “Years, Cap\u0027n,” said Harga. “You bin coming in here nearly every day, reg\u0027lar. One of my best customers.” Vimes leaned over the counter until his nose was level with the squashy pink thing in the middle of Har-ga\u0027s face. “And in all that time, have you ever changed the fat?” he demanded. Harga tried to back away. “Well-” “It\u0027s been like a friend to me, that old fat,” said Vimes. “There\u0027s little black bits in there I\u0027ve grown to know and love. It\u0027s a meal in itself. And you\u0027ve cleaned out the coffee jug, haven\u0027t you. I can tell. This is love-in-a-canoe coffee if ever I tasted it. The other stuff had flavour. ” “Well, I thought it was time-” “Why?” Harga let the pan fall from his pudgy fingers. “Well, I thought, if the king should happen to come in-” “But, Cap\u0027n-” Vimes\u0027s accusing finger buried itself up to the second joint in Harga \u0027s expansive vest. “You don\u0027t even know the wretched fellow\u0027s name!” he shouted. Harga rallied. “I do, Cap\u0027n,” he stuttered. “Course I do. Seen it on the decorations and everything. He\u0027s called Rex Vivat.” Very gently, shaking his head in despair, crying in his heart for the essential servility of mankind, Vimes let him go. In another time and place, the Librarian finished reading. He\u0027d reached the end of the text. Not the end of the book-there was plenty more book. It had been scorched beyond the point of legibility, though. Not that the last few unburned pages were very easy to read. The author\u0027s hand had been shaking, he\u0027d been writing fast, and he\u0027d blotted a lot. But the Librarian had wrestled with many a terrifying text in some of the worst books ever bound, words that tried to read you as you read them, words that writhed on the page. At least these weren\u0027t words like that. These were just the words of a man frightened for his life. A man writing a dreadful warning. It was a page a little back from the burned section that drew the Librarian\u0027s eye. He sat and stared at it for some time. Then he stared at the darkness. It was his darkness. He was asleep out there somewhere. Somewhere out there a thief was heading for this place, to steal this book. And then someone would read this book, read these words, and do it anyway. His hands itched. All he had to do was hide the book, or drop on to the thief\u0027s head and unscrew it by the ears. He stared into the darkness again . . . But that would be interfering with the course of history. Horrible things could happen. The Librarian knew all about this sort of thing, it was part of what you had to know before you were allowed into L-space. He\u0027d seen pictures in ancient books. Time could bifurcate, like a pair of trousers. You could end up in the wrong leg, living a life that was actually happening in the other leg, talking to people who weren\u0027t in your leg, walking into walls that weren\u0027t there any more. Life could be horrible in the wrong trouser of Time. Besides, it was against Library rules.[18] The assembled Librarians of Time and Space would certainly have something to say about it if he started to tinker with causality. He closed the book carefully and tucked it back into the shelf. Then he swung gently from bookcase to bookcase until he reached the doorway. For a moment he stopped and looked down at his own sleeping body. Perhaps he wondered, briefly, whether to wake himself up, have a little chat, tell himself that he had friends and not to worry. If so, he must have decided against it. You could get yourself into a lot of trouble that way. Instead he slipped out of the door, and lurked in the shadows, and followed the hooded thief when it came out clutching the book, and waited near the dread portal in the rain until the Elucidated Brethren had met and, when the last one left, followed him to his home, and murmured to himself in anthropoid surprise . . . And then ran back to his Library and the treacherous pathways of L-space. By mid-morning the streets were packed, Vimes had docked Nobby a day\u0027s salary for waving a flag, and an air of barbed gloom settled over the Yard, like a big black cloud with occasional flashes of lightning in it. “ \u0027Get up in a high place\u0027, ” muttered Nobby. “That\u0027s all very well to say.” “I was looking forward to lining the streets,” said Colon. “I\u0027d have got a good view.” “You were going on about privilege and the rights of man the other night,” said Nobby accusingly. “Yes, well, one of the privileges and rights of this man is getting a good view,” said the sergeant. “That\u0027s all I\u0027m saying.” “I\u0027ve never seen the captain in such a filthy temper,” said Nobby. “I liked it better when he was on the drink. I reckon he\u0027s-” “You know, I think Errol is really ill,” said Carrot. They turned towards the fruit basket. “He\u0027s very hot. And his skin looks all shiny.” “What\u0027s the right temperature for a dragon?” said Colon. “Yeah. How do you take it?” said Nobby. “I think we ought to ask Lady Ramkin to have a look at him,” said Carrot. “She knows about these things.” “No, she\u0027ll be getting ready for the coronation. We shouldn\u0027t go disturbing her,” said Colon. He stretched out his hand to Errol\u0027s quivering flanks. “I used to have a dog that-arrgh! That\u0027s not hot, that\u0027s boiling!” “I\u0027ve offered him lots of water and he just won\u0027t touch it. What are you doing with that kettle, Nobby?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/guards-guards-discworld-8/page-32.html","bookId":1627,"book":{"id":1627,"title":"Guards! Guards!
