{"id":74883,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"She took a step back from him. \"Jack,\" she said. \"You know I can\u0027t discuss the sale. No one can, until the ink\u0027s dry.\" \"Okay,\" Rogers said. He took out his notepad. \"It does seem like a pretty crazy rumor. No company\u0027s ever offset the wing. It\u0027d be suicide.\" \"Exactly,\" she said. In the end, she kept coming back to that same question. Why would Edgarton offset the wing? Why would any company offset the wing? It just made no sense. Rogers glanced up from his pad. \"I wonder why the union thinks the wing\u0027s being sent offshore?\" She shrugged. \"You\u0027ll have to ask them.\" He had sources in the union. Certainly Brail. Probably others as well. \"I hear they\u0027ve got documents that prove it.\" Casey said, \"They show them to you?\" Rogers shook his head. \"No.\" \"I can\u0027t imagine why not, if they have them.\" Rogers smiled. He made another note. \"Shame about the rotor burst in Miami.\" \"All I know is what I saw on television.\" \"You think it will affect the public perception of the N-22?\" He had his pen out, ready to take down what she said. \"I don\u0027t see why. The problem was powerplant, not air-frame. My guess is, they\u0027re going to find it was a bad compressor disk that burst.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t doubt it,\" he said. \"I was talking to Don Peterson over at the FAA. He told me that incident at SFO was a sixth-stage compressor disk that blew. The disk had brittle nitrogen pockets.\" \"Alpha inclusions?\u0027 she said. \"That\u0027s right,\" Jack said. \"And there was also dwell-time fatigue.\" Casey nodded. Engine parts operated at a temperature of 2500 degrees Fahrenheit, well above the melt temperature of most alloys, which turned to soup at 2200 degrees. So they were manufactured of titanium alloys, using the most advanced procedures. Fabricating some of the parts was an art - the fan blades were essentially \"grown\" as a single crystal of metal, making them phenomenally strong. But even in skilled hands, the manufacturing process was inherently delicate. Dwell-time fatigue was a condition in which the titanium used to make rotor disks clumped into microstructure colonies, rendering them vulnerable to fatigue cracks. \"And how about the Transpacific flight,\" Rogers said. \"Was that an engine problem, too?\" \u0027Transpacific happened yesterday, Jack. We just started our investigation.\" \"You\u0027re QA on the IRT, right?\" \"Right, yes.\" \"Are you pleased with how the investigation is going?\" \"Jack, I can\u0027t comment on the Transpacific investigation. It\u0027s much too early.\" \"Not too early for speculation to start,\" Rogers said. \"You know how these things go, Casey. Lot of idle talk. Misinformation that can be difficult to clear up later. I\u0027d just like to set the record straight. Have you ruled out engines?\" \"Jack,\" she said, \"I can\u0027t comment.\" \"Then you haven\u0027t ruled out engines?\" \"No comment, Jack.\" He made a note on his pad. Without looking up, he said, \"And I suppose you\u0027re looking at slats, too.\" \"We\u0027re looking at everything, Jack,\" she said. \"Given the 22 has a history of slats problems ...\" \"Ancient history,\" she said. \"We fixed the problem years ago. You wrote a story about it, if I recall.\" \"But now you\u0027ve had two incidents in two days. Are you worried that the flying public will start to think the N-22 is a troubled aircraft?\" She could see the direction his story was going to take. She didn\u0027t want to comment, but he was telling her what he would write if she didn\u0027t. It was a standard, if minor, form of press blackmail. \"Jack,\" she said, \"we\u0027ve got three hundred N-22s in service around the world. The model has an outstanding safety record.\" In fact, in five years of service there had been no fatalities involving the aircraft until yesterday. That was a reason for pride, but she decided not to mention it, because she could see his lead: The first fatalities to occur on a Norton N-22 aircraft happened yesterday... Instead she said, \"The public is best served by getting accurate information. And at the moment, we have no information to offer. To speculate would be irresponsible.\" That did it. He took his pen away. \"Okay. You want to go off?\" \"Sure.\" She knew she could trust him. \"Off the record, 545 underwent very severe pitch oscillations. We think the plane porpoised. We don\u0027t know why. The FDR\u0027s anomalous. It\u0027ll take days to reconstruct the data. We\u0027re working as fast as we can.\" \"Will it affect the China sale?\" \"I hope not.\" \"Pilot was Chinese, wasn\u0027t he? Chang?\" \"He was from Hong Kong. I don\u0027t know his nationality.\" \"Does that make it awkward if it\u0027s pilot error?\" \"You know how these investigations are, Jack. Whatever the cause turns out to be, it\u0027s going to be awkward for somebody. We can\u0027t worry about that. We just have to let the chips fall where they fall.\" \"Of course,\" he said. \"By the way, is that China sale firm? I keep hearing it\u0027s not.\" She shrugged. \"I honestly don\u0027t know.\" \"Has Marder talked to you about it?\" \"Not to me personally,\" she said. Her reply was carefully worded; she hoped he wouldn\u0027t follow up on it. He didn\u0027t \"Okay, Casey,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll leave this alone, but what\u0027ve you got? I need to file today.\" \"How come you\u0027re not doing Cheapskate Airlines?\" she said, using the derogatory in-house term for one of the low-cost carriers. \"Nobody\u0027s done that story yet.\" \"Are you kidding?\" Rogers said. \"Everybody and his brother\u0027s covering mat one.\" \"Yeah, but nobody\u0027s doing the real story,\" she said. \"Super-cheap carriers are a stock scam.\" \"A stock scam?\" \"Sure,\" Casey said. \"You buy some aircraft so old and poorly maintained no reputable carrier will use them for spares. Then you subcontract maintenance to limit your liability. Then you offer cheap fares, and use the cash to buy new routes. It\u0027s a pyramid scheme but on paper it looks great. Volume\u0027s up, revenue\u0027s up, and Wall Street loves you. You\u0027re saving so much on maintenance that your earnings skyrocket. Your stock price doubles and doubles again. By the time the bodies start piling up, as you know they will, you\u0027ve made your fortune off the stock, and can afford the best counsel. That\u0027s the genius of deregulation, Jack. When the bill comes, nobody pays.\" \"Except the passengers.\" \"Exactly,\" Casey said. \"Flight safety\u0027s always been an honor system. The FAA\u0027s set up to monitor the carriers, not to police them. So if deregulation\u0027s going to change the rules, we ought to warn the public. Or triple FAA funding. One or the other.\" Rogers nodded. \"Barry Jordan over at the LA Times told me he\u0027s doing the safety angle. But that takes a lot of resources - lead time, lawyers going over your copy. My paper can\u0027t afford it. I need something I can use tonight.\" \"Off the record,\" Casey said, \"I\u0027ve got a good lead, but you can\u0027t source it.\" \"Sure,\" Rogers said. \"The engine that blew was one of six that Sunstar bought from AeroCivicas,\" Casey said. \"Kenny Burne was our consultant. He borescoped the engines and found a lot of damage.\" \"What kind of damage?\" \"Blade notch breakouts and vane cracks.\" Rogers said, \"They had fatigue cracks in the fan blades!\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Casey said. \"Kenny told them to reject the engines, but Sunstar rebuilt them and put them on the planes. When that engine blew, Kenny was furious. So you might get a name at Sunstar from Kenny. But we can\u0027t be the source, Jack. We have to do business with these people.\" \"I understand,\" Rogers said. \"Thanks. But my editor\u0027s going to want to know about the accidents on the floor today. So tell me. Are you convinced the China offset stories are groundless?\" \"Are we back on?\" she said. \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m not the person to ask,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll have to talk to Edgarton.\" \"I called, but his office says he\u0027s out of town. Where is he? Beijing?\" \"I can\u0027t comment.\" \"And what about Marder?\" Rogers said. \"What about him?\" Rogers shrugged. \"Everybody knows Marder and Edgarton are at each other\u0027s throats. Marder expected to be named president, but the Board passed him over. But they gave Edgarton a one-year contract - so he\u0027s got only twelve months to produce. And I hear Marder\u0027s undercutting Edgarton, every way he can.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know about that,\" she said. Casey had, of course, heard such rumors. It was no secret that Marder was bitterly disappointed about Edgarton\u0027s appointment. What Marder could do about it was another story. Marder\u0027s wife controlled eleven percent of company stock. With Marder\u0027s connections, he could probably pull together five percent more. But sixteen percent wasn\u0027t enough to call the shots, particularly since Edgarton had the strong support of the Board. So most people in the plant thought that Marder had no choice except to go along with Edgarton\u0027s agenda - at least for the moment. Marder might be unhappy, but he had no option. The company had a cash-flow problem. They were already building planes without buyers. Yet they needed billions of dollars, if they hoped to develop the next generation of planes, and stay in business in the future. So the situation was clear. The company needed the sale. And everybody knew it. Including Marder. Rogers said, \"You haven\u0027t heard Marder\u0027s undercutting Edgarton?\" \"No comment,\" Casey said. \"But off the record, it makes no sense. Everybody in the company wants this sale, Jack. Including Marder. Right now, Marder\u0027s pushing us hard to solve 545, so the sale goes through.\" \"Do you think the image of the company will be hurt by the rivalry between its two top officers?\" \"I couldn\u0027t say.\" \"Okay,\" he said finally, closing his notepad. \"Call me if you get a break on 545, okay?\" \"Sure, Jack.\" \"Thanks, Casey.\" Walking away from nun, she realized she was exhausted by the effort of the interview. Talking to a reporter these days was like a deadly chess match; you had to think several steps ahead; you had to imagine all the possible ways a reporter might distort your statement. The atmosphere was relentlessly adversarial. It hadn\u0027t always been that way. There was a time when reporters wanted information, their questions directed to an underlying event They wanted an accurate picture of a situation, and to do that they had to make the effort to see things your way, to understand how you were thinking about it. They might not agree with you in the end, but it was a matter of pride that they could accurately state your view, before rejecting it. The interviewing process was not very personal, because the focus was on the event they were trying to understand. But now reporters came to the story with the lead fixed in their minds; they saw their job as proving what they already knew. They didn\u0027t want information so much as evidence of villainy. In this mode, they were openly skeptical of your point of view, since they assumed you were just being evasive. They proceeded from a presumption of universal guilt, in an atmosphere of muted hostility and suspicion. This new mode was intensely personal: they wanted to trip you up, to catch you in a small error, or in a foolish statement - or just a phrase that could be taken out of context and made to look silly or insensitive. Because the focus was so personal, the reporters asked continuously for personal speculations. Do you think an event will be damaging? Do you think the company will suffer? Such speculation had been irrelevant to the earlier generation of reporters, who focused on the underlying events. Modem journalism was intensely subjective - \"interpretive\" - and speculation was its lifeblood. But she found it exhausting. And Jack Rogers, she thought, was one of the better ones. The print reporters were all better. It was the television reporters you really had to watch out for. They were the really dangerous ones. OUTSIDE HANGAR 5 10:15 A.M. Crossing the plant, she fished her cell phone out of her purse, and called Marder. His assistant, Eileen, said he was in a meeting. \"I just left Jack Rogers,\" Casey said. \"I think he\u0027s planning a story that says we\u0027re shipping the wing to China, and there\u0027s trouble in the executive suite.\" \"Uh-oh,\" Eileen said. \"That\u0027s not good.\" \"Edgarton better talk to him, and put it to rest.\" \"Edgarton isn\u0027t doing any press,\" Eileen said. \"John will be back at six o\u0027clock. You want to talk to him then?\" \"I better, yes.\" \"I\u0027ll put you down,\" Eileen said. PROOF TEST 10:19 A.M. It looked like an aviation junkyard: old fuselages, tails, and wing sections littered the landscape, raised up on rusty scaffolding. But the air was filled with the steady hum of compressors, and heavy tubing ran to the airplane parts, like intravenous lines to a patient This was Proof Test, also known as Twist-and-Shout, the domain of the infamous Amos Peters. Casey saw him off to the right, a hunched figure in shirtsleeves and baggy pants, bent over a readout stand, beneath an aft fuselage section of the Norton widebody. \"Amos,\" she called, waving as she walked over to him. He turned, glanced at her. \"Go away.\" Amos was a legend at Norton. Reclusive and obstinate, he was nearly seventy, long past mandatory retirement age, yet he continued to work because he was vital to the company. His specialty was the arcane field of damage tolerance, or fatigue testing. And fatigue testing was of vastly greater importance than it had been ten years before. Since deregulation, the carriers were flying aircraft longer than anybody ever expected. Three thousand aircraft in the domestic fleet were now more than twenty years old. That number would double in five years. Nobody really knew what would happen to all those aircraft as they continued to age. Except Amos. It was Amos who had been brought in by the NTSB as a consultant on the famous Aloha 737 accident, back in 1988. Aloha was an inter-island carrier in Hawaii. One of their airplanes was cruising at 24,000 feet when suddenly eighteen feet of the airplane\u0027s outer skin peeled off the fuselage, from the cabin door to the wing; the cabin decompressed, and a stewardess was sucked out and killed. Despite the explosive pressure loss, the plane managed to land safely at Maui, where it was scrapped on the spot. The rest of Aloha\u0027s fleet was examined for corrosion and fatigue damage. Two more high-time 737s were scrapped, and a third underwent months of repairs. All three had extensive skin cracks and other corrosion damage. When the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating inspections of the rest of the 737 fleet, forty-nine more planes, operated by eighteen different carriers, were found to have extensive cracking. Industry observers were perplexed by the accident, because Boeing, Aloha, and the FAA were supposedly all watching the carrier\u0027s 737 fleet. Corrosion cracking was a known problem on some early-production 737s; Boeing had already warned Aloha that the salty, humid Hawaiian climate was a \"severe\" corrosion environment. Afterward, the investigation found multiple causes for the accident. It turned out that Aloha, making short hops between islands, was accumulating flight cycles of takeoff and landing at a faster rate than maintenance was scheduled to handle. This stress, combined with corrosion from ocean air, produced a series of small cracks in the aircraft skin. These were unnoticed by Aloha, because they were short of trained personnel. The FAA didn\u0027t catch them because they were overworked and understaffed. The FAA\u0027s principal maintenance inspector in Honolulu supervised nine carriers and seven repair stations around the Pacific, from China to Singapore to the Philippines. Eventually, a flight occurred in which the cracks extended and the structure failed. Following the incident, Aloha, Boeing, and the FAA formed a circular firing squad. The undetected structural damage in Aloha\u0027s fleet was variously attributed to poor management, poor maintenance, poor FAA inspection, poor engineering. Accusations ricocheted back and forth for years afterward. But the Aloha flight had also focused industry attention on the problem of aging aircraft, and it had made Amos famous within Norton. He\u0027d convinced management to begin buying more old aircraft, turning wings and fuselages into proof test articles. Day after day, his test fixtures applied repetitive pressures to aging aircraft, stressing them to simulate takeoffs and landings, wind shear and turbulence, so Amos could study how and where they cracked. \"Amos,\" she said, coming up to him, \"it\u0027s me. Casey Singleton.\" He blinked myopically. \"Oh. Casey. Didn\u0027t recognize you.\" He squinted at her. \"Doctor gave me a new prescription ... Oh. Huh. How are you?\" He gestured for her to walk with him, and he headed toward a small building a few yards away. No one at Norton could understand how Casey was able to get along with Amos, but they were neighbors; he lived alone with his pug dog, and she had taken to cooking him a meal every month or so. In return, Amos regaled her with stories of aircraft accidents he\u0027d worked on, going back to the first BO AC Comet crashes in the 1950s. Amos had an encyclopedic knowledge of airplanes. She had learned a tremendous amount from him, and he had become a sort of adviser to her. \"Didn\u0027t I see you the other morning?\" he said. \"Yes. With my daughter.\" \"Thought so. Want coffee?\" He opened the door to a shed, and she smelted the sharp odor of burned grounds. His coffee was always terrible. \"Sounds great, Amos,\" she said. He poured her a cup. \"Hope black is okay. Ran out of that creamer stuff.\" \"Black is fine, Amos.\" He hadn\u0027t had creamer for a year. Amos poured a cup for himself in a stained mug, and waved her to a battered chair, facing his desk. The desk was piled high with thick reports. FAA/NASA International Symposium on Advanced Structural Integrity. Airframe Durability and Damage Tolerance. Thermographic Inspection Techniques. Corrosion Control and Structures Technology. He put his feet up on the desk, cleared a path through the journals, so he could see her. \"I tell you, Casey. It\u0027s tedious working with these old hulks. I long for the day when we have another T2 article in here.\" \"T2?\" she said. \"Of course you wouldn\u0027t know,\" Amos said. \"You\u0027ve been here five years, and we haven\u0027t made a new model aircraft in all that time. But when there\u0027s a new aircraft, the first one off the line is called Tl. Test Article 1. It goes to Static Test - we put it on the test bed and shake it to pieces. Find out where the weaknesses are. The second plane off the line is T2. It\u0027s used for fatigue testing - a more difficult problem. Over time, metal loses tensile strength, gets brittle. So we take T2, put it in a jig, and accelerate fatigue testing. Day after day, year after year, we simulate takeoffs and landings. Norton\u0027s policy is we fatigue test to more than twice the design life of the aircraft. If the engineers design an aircraft for a twenty-year life span - say, fifty thousand hours and twenty thousand cycles - we\u0027ll do more than twice that in the pit, before we ever deliver to a customer. We know the planes will stand up. How\u0027s your coffee?\" She took a small sip, managed not to wince. Amos ran water through the same old grinds, all day long. That was how it got this distinctive flavor. \"Good, Amos.\" \"Just ask. There\u0027s more where that came from. Anyway, most manufacturers test to twice the design life. We test up to four times the spec. That\u0027s why we always say, the other companies make doughnuts, Norton makes croissants.\" Casey said, \"And John Marder always says, That\u0027s why the others make money, and we don\u0027t.\" \"Marder.\" Amos snorted. \"It\u0027s all money with him, all bottom line. In the old days, the front office told us, Make the best damn airplane you can. Now they say, Make the best airplane you can for a price. Different instruction, you know what I mean?\" He slurped his coffee. \"So. What is it, Casey - 545?\" She nodded. \"Can\u0027t help you there,\" he said. \"Why do you say that?\" \"The plane\u0027s new. Fatigue\u0027s not a factor.\" \"There\u0027s a question about a part, Amos,\" she said. She showed him the pin, in a plastic bag. \"Hmm.\" He turned it over in his hands, held it up to the light. \u0027This would be - don\u0027t tell me - this would be an anterior locking pin for the second inboard slat.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Of course it\u0027s right.\" He frowned. \"But this part\u0027s bad.\" \"Yes, I know.\" \"So what\u0027s your question?\u0027 \"Doherty thinks it failed the aircraft. Could it?\" \"Well...\" Amos stared at the ceiling, thinking. \"No. I got a hundred bucks says it didn \u0027t fail the aircraft.\" Casey sighed. She was back to square one. They had no leads. \"Discouraged?\" Amos said. \"Yes, frankly.\" \"Then you\u0027re not paying attention,\" he said. \"This is a very valuable lead.\" \"But why? You just said yourself - it didn\u0027t fail the aircraft.\" \"Casey, Casey.\" Amos shook his head. \"Think.\" She tried to think, sitting there, smelling his bad coffee. She tried to see what he was driving at. But her mind was blank. She looked at him across the desk. \"Just tell me. What am I missing?\" \"Were the other locking pins replaced?\u0027 \"No.\" \"Just this one?\u0027 \"Yes.\" \"Why just this one, Casey?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Find out,\" he said. \"Why? What good will that do?\" Amos threw up his hands. \"Casey. Come on, now. Think it through. You have a problem with slats on 545. That\u0027s a wing problem.\" \"Correct.\" \"Now you\u0027ve found a part that\u0027s been replaced on the wing.\" \"Correct.\" \"Why was it replaced?\" \"I don\u0027t know...\" \"Was that wing damaged in the past? Did something happen to it, so that this part had to be replaced? Were other parts replaced as well? Are there other bad parts on the wing? Is there residual damage to the wing?\" \"Not that you can see.\" Amos shook his head impatiently. \"Forget what you can see, Casey. Look at the ship\u0027s record and the maintenance records. Trace this part, and get a history of the wing. Because something else is wrong.\" \"My guess is you\u0027ll find more fake parts.\" Amos stood, sighing. \"More and more planes have fake parts, these days. I suppose it\u0027s to be expected. These days, everybody seems to believe in Santa Claus.\" \"How\u0027s that?\" \"Because they believe in something for nothing,\" Amos said. \"You know: government deregulates the airlines, and everybody cheers. We got cheaper fares: everybody cheers. But the carriers have to cut costs. So the food is awful. That\u0027s okay. There are fewer direct flights, more hubs. That\u0027s okay. The planes look grubby, because they redo the interiors less often. That\u0027s okay. But still the carriers have to cut more costs. So they run the planes longer, buy fewer new ones. The fleet ages. That\u0027ll be okay - for a while. Eventually it won\u0027t be. And meanwhile, cost pressures continue. So where else do they cut? Maintenance? Parts? What? It can\u0027t go on indefinitely. Just can\u0027t. Of course, now Congress is helping them out, by cutting appropriations for the FAA, so there\u0027ll be less oversight. Carriers can ease up on maintenance because nobody\u0027s watching. And the public doesn\u0027t care, because for thirty years this country\u0027s had the best aviation safety record in the world. But the thing is, we paid for it. We paid to have new, safe planes and we paid for the oversight to make sure they were well maintained. But those days are over. Now, everybody believes in something for nothing.\" \"So where\u0027s it going to end?\" she said. \"I got a hundred bucks,\" he said, \"they\u0027ll reregulate within ten years. There\u0027ll be a string of crashes, and they\u0027ll do it. The free marketeers will scream, but the fact is, free markets don\u0027t provide safety. Only regulation does that. You want safe food, you better have inspectors. You want safe water, you better have an EPA. You want a safe stock market, you better have the SEC. And you want safe airlines, you better regulate them, too. Believe me, they will.\" \"And on 545 ...\" Amos shrugged. \"Foreign carriers operate with much less stringent regulation. It\u0027s pretty loosey-goosey out there. Look at the maintenance records - and look hard at the paper for any part you\u0027re suspicious of.\" She started to leave. \"But Casey ...\" She turned back. \"Yes?\" \"You understand the situation, don\u0027t you? To check that part, you\u0027ll have to start with the ship\u0027s record.\" \"I know.\" \"That\u0027s in Building 64. I wouldn\u0027t go there, right now. At least not alone.\" \"Come on, Amos,\" she said. \"I used to work on the floor. I\u0027ll be okay.\" Amos was shaking his head. \"Flight 545\u0027s a hot potato. You know how the guys think. If they can mess up the investigation, they will - any way they can. Be careful.\" \"I will.\" \"Be very, very careful.\" BLD6 64 11:45 A.M. Running down the center of Building 64 was a series of one-story chain-link cages that housed parts for the line, and terminal workstations. The workstations were placed inside small partitions, each containing a microfiche reader, a parts terminal, and a main system terminal. In the parts cage, Casey bent over a microfiche reader, scrolling through photocopies of the ship\u0027s record for Fuse 271, which was the original factory designation for the aircraft involved in the TPA accident. Jerry Jenkins, the parts flow control manager on the floor, stood beside her nervously, tapping his pen on the table and saying, \"Find it yet? Find it yet?\" \"Jerry,\" she said, \"take it easy.\" \"I\u0027m easy,\" he said, glancing around the floor. \"I\u0027m just thinking, you know, you could have done this between shifts.\" Between shifts would have drawn less attention. \"Jerry,\" she said, \"we\u0027re in kind of a rush here.\" He tapped his pen. \"Everybody\u0027s pretty hot about the China sale. What do I tell the guys?\" \"You tell the guys,\" she said, \"that if we lose that China sale, then this line will shut down, and everybody will be out of a job.\" Jerry swallowed. \"That true? Because I hear - \" \"Jerry, let me look at the record, will you?\" The ship\u0027s record consisted of the mass of documentation - a million pieces of paper, one for every part on the aircraft - used to assemble the aircraft. This paper, and the even more extensive documentation required for FAA type certification, contained Norton proprietary information. So the FAA didn\u0027t store these records, because if they did, competitors could obtain it under the Freedom of Information Act. So Norton warehoused five thousand pounds of paper, running eighty feet of shelf space for each aircraft, in a vast building in Compton. All this was copied onto microfiche, for access at these readers on the floor. But finding the paper for a single part was time-consuming, she thought, and - \"Find it yet? Find it?\" \"Yeah,\" she said at last. \"I got it\" She was staring at a photocopy of a sheet of paper from Hoffman Metal Works, in Montclair, California The slats locking pin was described in a code that matched the engineering drawings: A/908/B-2117L (2) Ant SI Lteh. SS/HT. A typed date of manufacture, a stamped date of delivery to the factory, and a date of installation. Followed by two stamps - one signed by the mechanic who installed the part on the aircraft, and a second by the QA inspector who approved the work. \"So,\" he said. \"That the OEM or what?\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s the OEM.\" Hoffman was the original equipment manufacturer. The part had come direct from them. No distributor was involved. Jerry was looking out through the chain link at the factory floor beyond. Nobody seemed to be paying any attention, but Casey knew that they were being watched. Jerry said, \"You leaving now?\" \"Yes, Jerry. I\u0027m leaving now.\" She headed across the floor, staying on the aisle that ran by the parts cages. Away from the overhead cranes. Glancing up at the overhead walkways to be sure nobody was up there. Nobody was. So far, they were leaving her alone. What she had learned so far was clear The original installed part on TPA 545 had come direct from a reputable supplier. The original part was good; the part Doherty found on the wing was bad. So Amos was right.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-8.html","bookId":2409,"book":{"id":2409,"title":"Airframe","description":"Storyline: The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.
