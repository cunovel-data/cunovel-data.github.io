The segment\u0027s all moved around. That tape runs maybe four, four-thirty. And you may show parts of it twice - I would. So you won\u0027t have much time for Barker and the others. It\u0027s going to be the tape, and the Norton spokesman. That\u0027s the core of the piece. So there isn\u0027t any choice. We have to nail this woman cold.\"\n Jennifer said nothing. She waited, while Marty thumbed through the file.\n \"Wait just a minute here,\" Marty said. He was staring at the file. \"Are you kidding me?\"\n \"No,\" Jennifer said.\n \"This is dynamite,\" Reardon said. \"Where\u0027d you get it?\"\n \"Norton sent it to me in a background package, three days ago, by accident.\"\n \"Bad accident,\" Marty said. \"Especially for Ms. Singleton.\"\n WAR ROOM\n 2:15P.M.\n Casey was crossing the plant, heading over to IAA, when her cell phone rang. It was Steve Nieto, the Fixer in Vancouver.\n \"Bad news,\" Nieto said. \"I went to the hospital yesterday. He\u0027s dead. Cerebral edema. Mike Lee wasn\u0027t around, so they asked me if I could identify the body, and - \"\n \"Steve,\" she said. \"Not on a cell phone. Send me a telex.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"But don\u0027t send it here. Send it to FT in Yuma.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n She hung up and entered Hangar 4, where the tape strips were laid out on the floor. She wanted to talk to Ringer about the pilot\u0027s hat they\u0027d found. That hat was critical to the story, as it was now becoming clear to Casey.\n She had a sudden thought, and called Norma. \"Listen, I think I know where that fax came from about the in-flight magazine.\"\n \"Does it matter?\"\n \"Yes. Call Centinela Hospital at the airport. Ask for a stewardess named Kay Liang. And this is what I want you to ask her. Better write it down.\"\n She spoke to Norma for several minutes, then hung up. Immediately, her cell phone rang again.\n \"Casey Singleton.\"\n Marder screamed, \"Where are you, for Chrissakes?\"\n \"Hangar Four,\" she said, \"I\u0027m trying to - \"\n \"You\u0027re supposed to be here\" Marder screamed. \"For the interview.\"\n \"The interview\u0027s four o\u0027clock.\"\n \"They moved it up. They\u0027re here now\"\n \"Now?\"\n \"Yes, they\u0027re all here, the crew, everybody, they\u0027re setting up. They\u0027re all waiting for you. It\u0027s now, Casey.\"\n Which was how she found herself in the War Room, sitting in a chair, with a makeup woman daubing at her face. The War Room was full of people, there were guys setting up big lights on stands, and taping sheets of cardboard to the ceiling. Other men were taping microphones to the table, and to the walls. There were two camera crews setting up, each with two cameras - four cameras in all, pointing in opposite directions. Two chairs had been arranged at opposite sides of the table, one for her, one for the interviewer.\n She thought it was inappropriate that they were taping in the War Room; she didn\u0027t know why Marder had agreed to it. She thought it was disrespectful that this room, where they worked and argued and struggled to understand what happened to planes in flight, had been turned into a prop for a television show. And she didn\u0027t like it.\n Casey was off-balance; everything was happening too fast. The makeup woman kept asking her to keep her head still, to close her eyes, then open them. Eileen, Marder\u0027s secretary, came over and thrust a manila folder in her hands. \"John wanted to make sure you had this,\" she said.\n Casey tried to look at the folder.\n \"Please,\" the makeup woman said, \"I need you to look up for a minute. Just a minute, then you can go.\"\n Jennifer Malone, the producer, came over with a cheerful smile. \"How\u0027s everything today, Ms. Singleton?\"\n \"Fine, thanks,\" Casey said. Still looking up for makeup.\n \"Barbara,\" Malone said, to the makeup woman. \"Make sure you get the, uh ...\" And she waved her hand toward Casey, a vague gesture.\n \"I will,\" the makeup woman said.\n \"Get the what?\" Casey said.\n \"A touchup,\" the makeup woman said. \"Nothing.\"\n Malone said, \"I\u0027ll give you a minute to finish here, and then Marty should be in to meet you, and we\u0027ll go over the general areas we\u0027re covering, before we start.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n Malone went away. The makeup woman, Barbara, continued to daub at Casey\u0027s face. \"I\u0027m going to give you a little under the eyes,\" she said. \"So you don\u0027t look so tired.\"\n \"Ms. Singleton?\"\n Casey recognized the voice at once, a voice she\u0027d heard for years. The makeup woman jumped back, and Casey saw Marty Reardon standing in front of her. Reardon was in shirtsleeves and a tie. He had Kleenex around his collar. He held out his hand. \"Marty Reardon. Nice to meet you.\"\n \"Hi,\" she said.\n \"Thanks for your help with this,\" Reardon said. \"We\u0027ll try to make it as painless as possible.\"\n \"Okay...\"\n \"You know of course we\u0027re on tape,\" Reardon said. \"So if you have a bobble or something, don\u0027t worry; we\u0027ll just cut it. If at any time you want to restate an answer, go ahead and do that. You can say exactly what you want to say.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Primarily we\u0027ll be talking about the Transpacific flight. But I\u0027m going to have to touch on some other matters as well. Somewhere along the line, I\u0027ll ask about the China sale. And there\u0027ll probably be some questions about the union response, if we have time. But I don\u0027t really want to get into those other issues. I want to stay with Transpacific. You\u0027re a member of the investigation team?\" \n \"Yes.\"\n \"All right, fine. I have a tendency to jump around in my questions. Don\u0027t let that bother you. We\u0027re really here to understand the situation as best we can.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"I\u0027ll see you later, then,\" Reardon said. He smiled, and turned away.\n The makeup woman moved back in front of her again. \"Look up,\" she said. Casey stared at the ceiling. \"He\u0027s very nice,\" the makeup woman said. \"A sweet man, underneath it all. Dotes on his children.\"\n She heard Malone call out, \"How much more time, guys?\"\n Someone said, \"Five minutes.\"\n \"Sound?\"\n \"We\u0027re ready. Just give us the bodies.\"\n The makeup woman began to powder Casey\u0027s neck. Casey winced, feeling twinges of pain. \"You know,\" the woman said, \"I have a number you can call.\"\n \"For what?\"\n \"It\u0027s a very good organization, very good people. Psychologists mostly. And extremely discreet. They can help you.\"\n \"With what?\"\n \"Look left, please. He must have hit you pretty hard.\"\n Casey said, \"I fell.\"\n \"Sure, I understand. I\u0027ll leave my card, in case you change your mind,\" the makeup woman said, using the powder puff. \"Hmm. I better get some base on that, to take the blue out.\" She turned back to her box, got a piece of sponge with makeup on it. She began to daub it onto Casey\u0027s neck. \"I can\u0027t tell you how much I see, in my line of work, and the woman always denies it. But domestic violence has to be stopped.\"\n Casey said, \"I live alone.\"\n \"I know, I know,\" the makeup woman said. \"Men count on your silence. My own husband, Jeez, he wouldn\u0027t go into counseling. I finally left with the kids.\"\n Casey said, \"You don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"I understand that when this violence is going on, you think there\u0027s nothing you can do. That\u0027s part of the depression, the hopelessness,\" the makeup woman said. \"But sooner or later, we all face the truth.\"\n Malone came over. \"Did Marty tell you? We\u0027re mostly doing the accident, and he\u0027ll probably start with that. But he may mention the China sale, and the unions. Just take your time. And don\u0027t worry if he jumps around from one thing to another. He does that.\"\n \"Look right,\" the makeup woman said, doing the other side of her neck. Casey turned to the right. A man came over and said, \"Ma\u0027am? Can I give you this?\" and he thrust a plastic box into her hands, with a dangling wire.\n \"What is it?\" Casey said.\n \"Look right, please,\" the makeup woman said. \"It\u0027s the radio mike. I\u0027ll help you with it in a minute.\"\n Her cell phone rang, in her purse on the floor beside her chair.\n \u0027Turn that off!\" someone shouted.\n Casey reached for it, flipped it open. \"It\u0027s mine.\"\n \"Oh, sorry.\"\n She brought the phone to her ear. John Marder said, \"Did you get the folder from Eileen?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Did you look at it?\"\n \"Not yet,\" she said.\n \"Just lift your chin a little,\" the makeup woman said.\n On the telephone, Marder said, \"The folder documents everything we talked about Parts report on the reverser cowl, everything. It\u0027s all there.\"\n \"Uh-huh ... Okay ...\"\n \"Just wanted to make sure you\u0027re all set.\"\n \"I\u0027m all set,\" she said.\n \"Good, we\u0027re counting on you.\"\n She clicked the phone off, turning the power switch off.\n \"Chin up,\" the makeup woman said. \u0027That\u0027s a girl.\"\n When makeup was finished, Casey stood, and the woman brushed her shoulders with a little brush, and put hair spray in her hair. Then she took Casey into the bathroom, and showed her how to thread the mike wire up under her blouse, through her bra, and clip it to her lapel. The wire ran back down inside her skirt, then back up to the radio box. The woman hooked the box to the waistband of Casey\u0027s skirt, and turned the power on.\n \"Remember,\" she said. \"From now on, you\u0027re live. They can hear whatever you say.\"\n \"Okay,\" Casey said. She adjusted her clothes. She felt the box pinching at her waist, the wire against the skin of her chest She felt cramped and uncomfortable.\n The makeup woman led her back into the War Room, holding her by the elbow. Casey felt like a gladiator being taken into the arena.\n Inside the War Room, the lights were glaring. The room was very hot. She was led to her seat at the table, told to watch she didn\u0027t trip over the camera cables, and helped to sit down. There were two cameras behind her. There were two cameras facing her. The cameraman behind her asked her to please move her chair an inch to the right. She did. A man came over and adjusted her microphone clip, because he said there was clothing noise.\n On the opposite side, Reardon was attaching his own microphone without assistance, chatting with the cameraman. Then he slipped easily into his chair. He looked relaxed, and casual. He faced her, smiled at her.\n \"Nothing to worry about,\" he said. \"Piece of cake.\"\n Malone said, \"Let\u0027s go, guys, they\u0027re in the chairs. It\u0027s hot in here.\"\n \"A camera ready.\"\n \"B camera ready.\"\n \"Sound ready.\"\n \"Let\u0027s have the lights,\" Malone said.\n Casey had thought the lights were already on, but suddenly, new harsh lights blazed down at her, from all directions. She felt as if she were in the middle of a glaring furnace.\n \"Camera check,\" Malone said.\n \"Fine here.\"\n \"We\u0027re fine.\"\n \"All right,\" Malone said. \"Roll tape.\"\n The interview began.\n WAR ROOM\n 2:33 P.M.\n Marty Reardon met her eyes, smiled, and gestured to the room. \"So. This is where it all happens.\"\n Casey nodded.\n \"This is where the Norton specialists meet to analyze aircraft accidents.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And you\u0027re part of that team.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"You\u0027re vice-president of Quality Assurance at Norton Aircraft.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Been with the company five years.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"They call this room the War Room, don\u0027t they?\"\n \"Some do, yes.\"\n \"Why is that?\"\n She paused. She couldn\u0027t think of any way to describe the arguments in this room, the flares of temper, the outbursts that accompanied every attempt to clarify an aircraft incident, without saying something he could take out of context.\n She said, \"It\u0027s just a nickname.\"\n \"The War Room,\" Reardon said. \"Maps, charts, battle plans, pressure. Tension under siege. Your company, Norton Aircraft, is under siege at the moment, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re referring to,\" Casey said.\n Reardon\u0027s eyebrows went up. \"The JAA, Europe\u0027s Joint Aviation Authority, is refusing to certify one of your aircraft, the N-22, because they say it\u0027s unsafe.\"\n \"Actually, the plane\u0027s already certified but - \"\n \"And you\u0027re about to sell fifty N-22s to China. But now the Chinese, too, are said to be concerned about the safety of the plane.\"\n She didn\u0027t get angry at the innuendo; she focused on Reardon. The rest of the room seemed to fade away.\n She said, \"I\u0027m not aware of any Chinese concerns.\"\n \"But you are aware,\" Reardon said, \"of the reason behind these safety concerns. Earlier this week, a very serious accident. Involving an N-22 aircraft.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \u0027Transpacific Flight 545. An accident in midair, over the Pacific Ocean.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Three people died. And how many injured?\"\n \"I believe fifty-six,\" she said. She knew it sounded awful, no matter how she said it\n \"Fifty-six injured,\" Reardon intoned. \"Broken necks. Broken limbs. Concussions. Brain damage. Two people paralyzed for life ...\"\n Reardon trailed off, looking at her.\n He hadn\u0027t asked a question. She said nothing. She waited, in the glaring heat of the lights.\n \"How do you feel about that?\"\n She said, \"I think everyone at Norton feels very great concern for air safety. That\u0027s why we test our airframes to three times the design life - \"\n \"Very great concern. Do you think that\u0027s an adequate response?\"\n Casey hesitated. What was he saying? \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t follow - \"\n \"Doesn\u0027t the company have an obligation to build safe aircraft?\"\n \"Of course. And we do.\"\n \"Not everyone agrees,\" Reardon said. \"The JAA doesn\u0027t agree. The Chinese may not agree ... Doesn\u0027t the company have an obligation to fix the design of an aircraft which it knows to be unsafe?\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"What I mean,\" Reardon said, \"is that what happened to Flight 545 has happened before. Many times before. On other N-22s. Isn\u0027t that true?\u0027\n \"No,\" Casey said.\n \"No?\" Reardon\u0027s eyebrows shot up.\n \"No,\" Casey said, firmly. This was the moment, she thought. She was stepping off the cliff.\n \"This is the first time?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well then,\" Reardon said, \"perhaps you can explain this list.\" He produced a sheet of paper, held it up. She knew from across the room what it was. \"This is a list of slats episodes on the N-22, going back to 1992, right after the plane was introduced. Eight episodes. Eight separate episodes. Transpacific is the ninth.\"\n \"That\u0027s not accurate.\"\n \"Well, tell me why.\"\n Casey went through, as briefly as she could, the way Airworthiness Directives worked. She explained why they had been issued for the N-22. How the problem had been solved, except for foreign carriers that had failed to comply. How there had not been a domestic incident since 1992.\n Reardon listened with continuously raised eyebrows, as if he had never heard such an outlandish thing before.\n \"So let me see if I understand,\" he said. \"In your view, the company has followed the rules. By issuing these air directives, which are supposed to fix the problem.\"\n \"No,\" Casey said. \"The company has fixed the problem.\"\n \"Has it? We\u0027re told slats deployment is the reason people died on Flight 545.\"\n \"That\u0027s incorrect\" She was now dancing on a tightrope, working a fine and technical line, and she knew it If he asked her, Did the slats deploy? she would be in trouble. She waited breathlessly for the next question.\n Reardon said, \"The people who told us the slats deployed are wrong?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know how they\u0027d know,\" Casey said. She decided to go farther. \"Yes, they\u0027re wrong.\"\n \"Fred Barker, former FAA investigator, is wrong.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"The JAA is wrong.\"\n \"Well, as you know, the JAA is actually delaying certification over noise emissions, and - \"\n \"Let\u0027s just stay with this for a moment,\" Reardon said.\n She remembered what Gershon had said: He\u0027s not interested in information.\n \"The JAA is wrong?\" he said, repeating the question.\n This called for a complicated answer, she thought. How could she put it briefly? \"They\u0027re wrong to say the aircraft is unsafe.\"\n \"So in your opinion,\" Reardon said, \"there is absolutely no substance to these criticisms of the N-22.\"\n \"That\u0027s correct. It is an excellent aircraft.\"\n \"A well-designed aircraft.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"A safe aircraft.\"\n \"Absolutely.\"\n \"You\u0027d fly in it\"\n \"Whenever possible.\"\n \"Your family, your friends ...\"\n \"Absolutely.\"\n \"No hesitation whatsoever?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"So what was your reaction, when you saw the tape on television from Flight 545?\"\n He \u0027II get you saying yes, then hit you from left field,\n But Casey was ready for it. \"All of us here knew that it was a very tragic accident. When I saw the tape, I felt very sad for the people involved.\"\n \"You felt sad.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t it shake your conviction about the aircraft? Make you question the N-22?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because the N-22 has a superb safety record. One of the best in the industry.\"\n \"One of the best in the industry...\" Reardon smirked.\n \"Yes, Mr. Reardon,\" she said. \"Let me ask you. Last year, forty-three thousand Americans died in automobile accidents. Four thousand people drowned. Two thousand people choked to death on food. Do you know how many died in domestic commercial transports?\"\n Reardon paused. He chuckled. \"I must admit you\u0027ve stumped the panel.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-21.html","bookId":2409,"book":{"id":2409,"title":"Airframe","description":"Storyline: \n The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \n \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.
