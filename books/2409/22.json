{"id":74897,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"It\u0027s a fair question, Mr. Reardon. How many died in commercial aircraft last year?\" Reardon frowned. \"I\u0027ll say ... I\u0027ll say a thousand.\" \"Fifty,\" Casey said. \"Fifty people died. Do you know how many died the year before that? Sixteen. Fewer than were killed on bicycles.\" \"And how many of those died on the N-22?\" Reardon asked, eyes narrowed, trying to recover. \"None,\" Casey said. \"So your point is ...\" \"We have a nation in which forty-three thousand people die every year in cars, and nobody worries about it at all. They get into cars when they\u0027re drunk, when they\u0027re tired - without a second thought. But these same people are panicked at the thought of getting on an airplane. And the reason,\" Casey said,\"is that television consistently exaggerates the real dangers involved. That tape will make people afraid to fly. And for no good reason.\" \"You think the tape shouldn\u0027t have been shown?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" \"But you said it will make people afraid - for no good reason.\" \"Correct.\" \"Is it your view tapes such as these should not be shown?\" She thought: Where is he going? Why is he doing this? \"I didn\u0027t say that\" \"I\u0027m asking you now.\" \"I said,\" Casey replied, \"that those tapes create an inaccurate perception of the danger of air travel.\" \"Including the danger of the N-22?\" \"I\u0027ve already said I think the N-22 is safe.\" \"So you don\u0027t think such tapes should be shown to the public.\" What the hell was he doing? She still couldn\u0027t figure it out. She didn\u0027t answer him; she was thinking hard. Trying to see where he was going with this. She had a sinking feeling she knew. \"In your view, Ms. Singleton, should such tapes be suppressed?\" \"No,\" Casey said. \"They should not be suppressed.\" \"No.\" \"Has Norton Aircraft ever suppressed any tapes?\" Uh-oh, she thought She was trying to figure out how many people knew of the tape. A lot, she decided: Ellen Fong, Ziegler, the people at Video Imaging. Maybe a dozen people, maybe more... \"Ms. Singleton,\" Reardon said, \"are you personally aware of any other tape of this accident?\" Just lie, Amos had said. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I know of another tape.\" \"And have you seen the tape?\" \"I have.\" Reardon said, \"It\u0027s upsetting. Horrifying. Isn\u0027t it?\u0027 She thought: They have it. They\u0027d gotten the tape. She would have to proceed very carefully now. \"It\u0027s tragic,\" Casey said. \"What happened on Flight 545 is a tragedy.\" She felt tired. Her shoulders ached from tension. \"Ms. Singleton, let me put it to you directly: Did Norton Aircraft suppress this tape?\" \"No-Eyebrows up, the look of surprise. \"But you certainly didn\u0027t release it, did you.\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"That tape was found on the aircraft,\" Casey said, \"and is being used in our ongoing investigation. We didn\u0027t feel it appropriate to release it until our investigation is completed.\" \"You weren\u0027t covering up the well-known defects of the N-22?\" \"No.\" \"Not everyone agrees with you about that, Ms. Singleton. Because Newsline obtained a copy of that tape, from a conscience-stricken Norton employee who felt that the company was covering up. Who felt the tape should be made public.\" Casey held herself rigid. She didn\u0027t move. \"Are you surprised?\" Reardon said, his lips in a curl. She didn\u0027t answer. Her mind was spinning. She had to plan her next move. Reardon was smirking, a patronizing smile. Enjoying the moment. Now. \"Have you yourself actually seen this tape, Mr. Reardon?\" She asked the question in a tone that implied the tape didn\u0027t exist, that Reardon was making it all up. \"Oh yes,\" Reardon said solemnly, \"I have seen the tape. It\u0027s difficult, painful to watch. It is a terrible, damning record of what happened on that N-22 aircraft.\" \"You\u0027ve seen it all the way through?\" \"Of course. So have my associates in New York.\" So it had already gone to New York, she thought. Careful. Careful. \"Ms. Singleton, was Norton ever planning to release that taper \"It\u0027s not ours to release. We\u0027d return it to the owners, after the investigation was completed. It would be up to the owners to decide what to do with it.\" \"After the investigation was completed ...\" Reardon was shaking his head. \"Forgive me, but for a company you say is committed to flight safety, there seems to be a consistent pattern of cover-ups here.\" \"Cover-ups?\" \"Ms. Singleton, if there was a problem with the airplane - a serious problem, an ongoing problem, a problem the company knew about - would you tell us?\" \"But there is no problem.\" \"Isn\u0027t there?\u0027 Reardon was looking down now, at the papers in front of him. \"If the N-22 is really as safe as you say, Ms. Singleton, then how do you explain this?\" And he handed her a sheet of paper. She took it, glanced at the paper. \"Jesus Christ,\" she said. Reardon had his media moment. He had gotten her unguarded, off-balance reaction. She knew it would look bad. She knew there was no way for her to recover from it, no matter what she said from this point on. But she was focused on the paper in front of her, stunned to see it now. It was a Xerox of the cover sheet of a report done three years ago. - PRIVILEGED INFORMATION - FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY NORTON AIRCRAFT INTERNAL REVIEW ACTION COMMITTEE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY UNSTABLE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS OF N-22 AIRCRAFT And following was a list of the names of the committee members. Beginning with her name, since she had chaired the committee. Casey knew that there was nothing improper about the study, nothing improper in its findings. But everything about it, even the name - \"Unstable Flight Characteristics\" - appeared damning. It was going to be very difficult for her to explain. He\u0027s not interested in information. And this was an internal company report, she thought. It should never have been released. It was three years old - not that many people would even remember it existed. How had Reardon gotten it? She glanced at the top of the page, saw a fax number, and the name of the sending station: NORTON QA. It had come from her own office. How? Who had done it? Richman, she thought, grimly. Richman had placed this report in the packet of press material on her desk. The material Casey had told Norma to fax to Newsline. How had Richman known about it? Marder. Marder knew all about the study. Marder had been program manager on the N-22; he\u0027d ordered it. And now Marder had arranged for the study to be released while she was on television, because - \"Ms. Singleton?\" Reardon said. She looked up. Back into the lights. \"Yes.\" \"Do you recognize this report?\" \"Yes, I do,\" she said. \"Is that your own name at the bottom?\" \"Yes.\" Reardon handed her three other sheets, the rest of the executive summary. \"In fact, you were the chairman of a secret committee inside Norton that investigated \u0027flight instabilities\u0027 of the N-22. Isn\u0027t that right?\" How was she going to do this? she thought. He\u0027s not interested in information. \"It wasn\u0027t a secret,\" she said. \u0027It\u0027s the kind of study we frequently conduct on operational aspects of our aircraft, once they\u0027re in service.\" \"By your own admission, it\u0027s a study of flight instabilities.\" \"Look,\" she said, \"this study is a good thing.\" \"A good thing?\" Eyebrows up, astonished. \"Yes,\" she said. \"After the first slats incident four years ago, there was a question about whether the aircraft had unstable handling characteristics, in certain configurations. We didn\u0027t avoid that question. We didn\u0027t ignore it. We addressed it head-on - by forming a committee, to test the aircraft in various conditions, and see if it were true. And we concluded - \" \"Let me read,\" Reardon said, \"from your own report. \"The aircraft relies upon computers for basic stabilization.\u0027\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"All modern aircraft use - \" \u0027\"The aircraft has demonstrated marked sensitivity to manual handling during attitude change!\u0027\" Casey was looking at the pages now. Following his quotes. \"Yes, but if you\u0027ll read the rest of the sentence, you will - \" Reardon cut in: \" \u0027Pilots have reported the aircraft cannot be controlled.\u0027\" \"But you\u0027re taking all this out of context\" \"Am I?\" Eyebrows up. \"These are all statements from your report. A secret Norton report.\" \"I thought you said you wanted to hear what I had to say.\" She was starting to get angry. She knew it showed, and didn\u0027t care. Reardon leaned back in his chair, spread his hands. The picture of reason. \"By all means, Ms. Singleton.\" \"Then let me explain. This study was carried out to determine whether the N-22 had a stability problem. We concluded it did not, and - \" \"So you say.\" \"I thought I was going to be allowed to explain.\" \"Of course.\" \"Then let me put your quotes in context,\" Casey said. \"The report says the N-22 relies on computers. All modem aircraft rely on computers for stabilization in flight. The reason is not because they can\u0027t be flown by pilots. They can. There\u0027s no problem with that But the carriers now want extremely fuel-efficient aircraft. Maximum fuel efficiency comes from minimal drag, as the aircraft flies through the air.\" Reardon was waving his hand, a dismissing gesture. \"I\u0027m sorry, but all this is beside - \" \u0027To minimize drag,\" Casey continued, \"the aircraft has to hold a very precise altitude, or position in the air. The most efficient position is slightly nose up. The computers hold the aircraft in this position during ordinary flight. None of this is unusual.\" \"Not unusual? Flight instabilities!\" Reardon said. He was always shifting the subject never letting her catch up. \"I\u0027m coming to that.\" \"We\u0027re eager to hear.\" Open sarcasm. She struggled to control her temper. However bad things were now, it would be worse if she lost her temper. \"You read a sentence before,\" she said. \"Let me finish it. \u0027The aircraft has demonstrated marked sensitivity to manual handling during attitude change, but this sensitivity is entirely within design parameters and presents no difficulty to properly certified pilots.\u0027 That\u0027s the rest of the sentence.\" \"But you\u0027ve admitted there is sensitive handling. Isn\u0027t that just another word for instability?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Sensitive does not mean unstable.\" \"The plane can\u0027t be controlled,\" Reardon said, shaking his head \"It can.\" \"You did a study because you were worried.\" \"We did a study because it\u0027s our job to make sure the aircraft is safe,\" she said. \"And we are sure: it is safe.\" \"A secret study.\" \"It wasn\u0027t secret.\" \"Never distributed. Never shown to the public ...\" \"It was an internal report,\" she said. \"You have nothing to hide?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Then why haven\u0027t you told us the truth about Transpacific Flight 545?\u0027 \"The truth?\" \"We\u0027re told your accident team already has a preliminary finding on the probable cause. Is that not true?\" \"We\u0027re close,\" she said. \"Close... Ms. Singleton, do you have a finding, or not?\" Casey stared at Reardon. The question hung in the air. \"I\u0027m very sorry,\" the cameraman said, behind her. \"But we have to reload.\" \"Camera reloading!\" \"Reloading!\" Reardon looked as if he had been slapped. But almost immediately he recovered. \u0027To be continued,\" he said, smiling at Casey. He was relaxed; he knew he had beaten her. He got up from his chair, turned his back to her. The big lights clicked off; the room seemed suddenly almost dark. Somebody turned the air-conditioning back on. Casey got up, too. She pulled the radio mike off her waist. The makeup woman came running over to her, holding out a powder puff. Casey held up her hand. \"In a minute,\" she said. With the lights off, she saw Richman, heading for the door. Casey hurried after him. BLDG 64 3:01 P.M. She caught him in the hallway, grabbed him by the arm, spun him around. \"You son of a bitch.\" \"Hey,\" Richman said. \u0027Take it easy.\" He smiled, nodded past her shoulder. Looking back, she saw the soundman and one of the cameramen coming out into the hallway. Furious, Casey pushed Richman backward, shoving him through the door to the women\u0027s room. Richman started to laugh. \"Jeez, Casey, I didn\u0027t know you cared - \" Then they were in the bathroom. She pushed him back against the row of sinks. \"You little bastard,\" she hissed, \"I don\u0027t know what the hell you think you\u0027re doing, but you released that report, and I\u0027m going to - \" \"You\u0027re going to do nothing,\" Richman said, his voice suddenly cold. He threw her hands off him. \"You still don\u0027t get it, do you? It\u0027s over, Casey. You just blew the China sale. You\u0027re finished.\" She stared at him, not understanding. He was strong, confident - a different person. \"Edgarton\u0027s finished. The China sale\u0027s finished. And you\u0027re finished.\" He smiled. \"Just the way John said it would happen.\" Marder, she thought. Marder was behind it. \"If the China sale goes, Marder will go, too. Edgarton will see to that.\" Richman was shaking his head, pityingly. \"No, he won\u0027t. Edgarton\u0027s sitting on his ass in Hong Kong, he\u0027ll never know what hit him. By noon Sunday, Marder\u0027ll be the new president of Norton Aircraft. It\u0027ll take him ten minutes with the Board. Because we\u0027ve made a much bigger deal with Korea. A hundred and ten aircraft firm, and an option on thirty-five more. Sixteen billion dollars. The Board will be thrilled.\" \"Korea,\" Casey said. She was trying to put it together. Because it was a huge order, the biggest in the history of the company. \"But why would - \" \"Because he gave them the wing,\" Richman said. \"And in return, they\u0027re more than happy to buy a hundred and ten aircraft. They don\u0027t care about sensationalistic American press. They know the plane\u0027s safe.\" \"He\u0027s giving them the wing?\" \"Sure. It\u0027s a killer deal.\" \"Yeah,\" Casey said. \"It kills the company.\" \"Global economy,\" Richman said. \"Get with the program.\" \"But you\u0027re gutting the company,\" she said, \"Sixteen billion dollars,\" Richman said. \"The minute that\u0027s announced, Norton stock\u0027ll go through the roof. Everybody gets well.\" Everybody but the people in the company, she thought. \"This is a done deal,\" Richman said. \"All we needed was somebody to publicly trash the N-22. And you just did that for us.\" Casey sighed. Her shoulders dropped. Looking past Richman, she saw herself in the mirror. Makeup was pancaked around her neck, and now it was cracking. Her eyes were dark. She looked haggard, exhausted. Defeated. \"So I suggest,\" Richman said, \"that you ask me, very politely, what you should do next. Because your only choice now is to follow orders. Do as you\u0027re told, be a good girl, and maybe John will give you severance. Say, three months. Otherwise, you\u0027re out on your fucking ass.\" He leaned close to her. \"Do you understand what I\u0027m saying?\" \"Yes,\" Casey said. \"I\u0027m waiting. Ask politely.\" In her exhaustion, her mind raced, examining the options, trying to see a way out But she could see no way out. Newsline would run the story. Marder\u0027s plan would succeed. She was defeated. She had been defeated from the very beginning. Defeated from the first day Richman had shown up. \"I\u0027m still waiting,\" Richman said. She looked at his smooth face, smelled his cologne. The little bastard was enjoying this. And in a moment of fury, of deep outrage, she suddenly saw another possibility. From the beginning, she had tried so hard to do the right thing, to solve the problem of 545. She had been honest, she had been straight, and it had just gotten her into trouble. Or had it? \"You have to face facts, here,\" Richman said. \"It\u0027s over. There\u0027s nothing you can do.\" She pushed away from the sink. \"Watch me,\" she said. And she walked out of the room. WAR ROOM 3:15P.M. Casey slipped into her seat. The soundman came over and clipped the radio pack to the waist of her dress. \"Say a few words for me, will you please? Just for level.\" \u0027Testing, testing, I\u0027m getting tired,\" she said. \"That\u0027s fine. Thank you.\" She saw Richman slip into the room, and stand with his back to the far wall. He had a faint smile on his face. He didn\u0027t look worried. He was confident there was nothing she could do. Marder had made a huge deal, he was shipping the wing, he was gutting the company, and he\u0027d used Casey to do it. Reardon dropped into his seat opposite her, shrugged his shoulders, adjusted his tie. He smiled at her. \"How you holding up?\" \"I\u0027m okay.\" \"Hot in here, isn\u0027t it?\" he said. He glanced at his watch. \"We\u0027re almost finished.\" Malone came over, and whispered in Reardon\u0027s ear. The whispering continued for some time. Reardon said, \"Really?\" and his eyebrows went up, then he nodded several times. Finally he said, \"Got it.\" He began to shuffle his papers, going through the folder in front of him. Malone said, \"Guys? We ready?\" \u0027\u0027A camera ready.\" \"B camera ready.\" \"Sound ready.\" \"Roll tape,\" she said. This is it Casey thought She took a deep breath, looked expectantly at Reardon. Reardon smiled at her. \"You\u0027re an executive at Norton Aircraft\" \"Yes.\" \"Been here five years.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-22.html","bookId":2409,"book":{"id":2409,"title":"Airframe","description":"Storyline: The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.
