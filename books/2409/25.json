{"id":74900,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"She waited for Malone. Five minutes later, Jennifer Malone came in, slamming the door behind her. She was wearing a pair of flight test coveralls. Her face was washed, her hair pulled back. And she was very angry. \"I don\u0027t know what you think you proved up there,\" she said. \"You had your fun. Taped the show. Scared the shit out of me. I hope you enjoyed it, because it isn\u0027t going to change a fucking thing in our story. Barker is right. Your plane has slats problems, just like he says. The only thing he\u0027s missing is that the problem occurs when the autopilot\u0027s off. That\u0027s all your little exercise demonstrated today. But our story isn\u0027t changed. Your plane\u0027s a deathtrap. And by the time we air our story, you won\u0027t be able to sell one of those planes on Mars. We\u0027re going to bury your shitty little airplane, and we\u0027re going to bury you.\" Casey did not speak. She thought: She\u0027s young. Young and stupid. The harshness of her own judgment surprised her. Perhaps she\u0027d learned something from the tough older men at the plant. Men who knew about power, as opposed to posturing and strutting. She let Malone rant awhile longer, and then she said, \"Actually, you\u0027re not going to do any of that.\" \"You fucking watch me.\" \"The only thing you can do is report what actually happened on Flight 545. You may not want to do that.\" \"You wait,\" Malone said, hissing. \"You fucking wait. It\u0027s a fucking deathtrap.\" Casey sighed. \"Sit down.\" \"I\u0027ll be goddamned if I will - \" \"Did you ever wonder,\" Casey said, \"how a secretary at a video house in Glendale knew you were doing a story on Norton? Had your cell phone number, and knew to call you?\" Malone was silent. \"Did you ever wonder,\" Casey said, \"how Norton\u0027s attorney could have found out so quickly you had the tape? And then have gotten a sworn statement from the receptionist that she\u0027d given it to you?\u0027 Malone was silent. \"Ed Fuller walked in the door of Video Imaging just a few minutes after you walked out, Ms. Malone. He was worried about running into you.\" Malone frowned. \"What is this?\" \"Did you ever wonder,\" Casey said, \"why Ed Fuller was so insistent you sign a document saying you didn\u0027t obtain the tape from a Norton employee?\" \"It\u0027s obvious. The tape\u0027s damaging. He doesn\u0027t want the company to be blamed.\" \"Blamed by whom?\u0027 \"By ... I don\u0027t know. The public.\" \"You better sit down,\" Casey said. She opened the file. Slowly, Malone sat. She frowned. \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said \"You\u0027re saying that secretary didn\u0027t call me, about the tape?\" Casey looked at her. \"Then who called?\u0027 Malone said. Casey said nothing. \"It was you!\" Casey nodded. \"You wanted me to have that tape?\u0027 \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" Casey smiled She handed Malone the first sheet of paper. \"This is a parts inspection record, stamped off by a PMI at the FAA yesterday, for the number two inboard slats proximity sensor on Flight 545. The part is noted to be cracked and defective. The crack is old.\" \"I\u0027m not doing a parts story,\" Malone said \"No,\" Casey said \"You\u0027re not Because what flight test showed you today is that any competent pilot could have handled the slats warning initiated by the bad part All the pilot had to do is leave the plane in autopilot. But on Flight 545, he didn\u0027t.\" Malone said, \"We already checked that. The captain of 545 was an outstanding pilot.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" Casey said. She passed her the next piece of paper. \"This is the crew manifest submitted to the FAA with the flight plan, on the date of departure of Flight 545.\" John Zhen Chang, Captain 5/7/51 M Leu Zan Ping, First Officer 3/11/59 M Richard Yong, First Officer 9/9/61 M Gerhard Reimann, First Officer 7/23/49 M Thomas Chang, First Officer 6/29/70 M Henri Marchand, Engineer 4/25/69 M Robert Sheng, Engineer 6/13/62 M Malone glanced at it, pushed it aside. \"And this is the crew manifest we got from Transpacific the day after the incident.\" JOHN ZHEN CHANG, CAPTAIN 5/7/51 LEU ZAN PING, FIRST OFFICER 3/11/59 RICHARD YONG, FIRST OFFICER 9/9/61 GERHARD REIMANN, FIRST OFFICER 7/23/49 HENRI MARCHAND, ENGINEER 4/25/69 THOMAS CHANG, ENGINEER 6/29/70 ROBERT SHENG, ENGINEER 6/13/62 Malone scanned it, shrugged \"It\u0027s the same.\" \"No, it\u0027s not. In one, Thomas Chang is listed as a first officer. In the second list, he appears as an engineer.\" Malone said, \"A clerical error.\" Casey shook her head. \"No.\" She passed another sheet. \"This is a page from the Transpacific in-flight magazine, showing Captain John Chang and his family. It was sent to us by a Transpacific flight attendant, who wanted us to know the real story. You will notice his children are Erica and Thomas Chang. Thomas Chang is the pilot\u0027s son. He was among the flight crew of Flight 545.\" Malone frowned. \"The Changs are a family of pilots. Thomas Chang is a pilot, qualified on several commuter aircraft. He is not type certified to fly the N-22.\" \"I don\u0027t believe this,\" Malone said. \"At the time of the incident,\" Casey continued \"the captain, John Chang, had left the cockpit and walked to the back of the plane for coffee. He was aft when the accident occurred, and severely injured. He underwent brain surgery in Vancouver two days ago. The hospital thought it was the first officer, but his identity has now been confirmed as John Zhen Chang.\" Malone was shaking her head Casey handed her a memo: FROM: S. NIETO, FSR VANC TO: C. SINGLETON, YUMA TEST FAC HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL AUTHORITIES NOW CONFIRM THE POSTMORTEM IDENTIFICATION OF INJURED CREW MEMBER IN VANCOUVER HOSPITAL AS JOHN ZHEN CHANG THE CAPTAIN OF TRANSPACIFIC FLIGHT 545. \"Chang wasn\u0027t in the cockpit,\" Casey said. \"He was in the back of the plane. His hat was found mere. So someone else was in the captain\u0027s chair, when the incident occurred.\" Casey turned on the television, started the tape. \"These are the concluding moments of the videotape which you obtained from the receptionist. You see the camera falling toward the front of the plane, and twisting to eventually lodge in the cockpit door. But before it does ... here!\" She froze the frame. \"You can see the flight deck.\" \"I can\u0027t see much,\" Malone said. \"They\u0027re both looking away.\" \"You can see that the pilot has extremely short hair,\" Casey said. \"Look at the picture. Thomas Chang has close-cropped hair.\" Malone was shaking her head, strongly now. \"I just don\u0027t believe this. That visual is not good enough, you have a three-quarter profile, it doesn\u0027t identify, it doesn\u0027t say anything.\" \"Thomas Chang has a small stud in his ear. You can see it in this magazine photo. And on the video, you can see the same stud catch the light, right there.\" Malone was silent. Casey pushed another piece of paper across to her. \"This is a translation of the Chinese voice communications in the cockpit as recorded on the tape you have. A great deal of it is unintelligible because of the cockpit alarms. But the relevant passage is marked for you.\" 0544:59 ALM stall stall stall 0545:00 F/O what (unintelligible) you 0545:01 CPTN am (unintelligible) correct the 0545:02 ALM stall stall stall 0545:03 F/O torn release die (unintelligible) 0545:04 CPTN what do (unintelligible) it 0545:11 F/O tommy (unintelligible) when (unintelligible) must (unintel?ligible) the Casey took the paper back. \"That\u0027s not for you to keep, or refer to publicly. But it corroborates the videotape in your possession.\" Malone said, in a stunned voice, \"He let his kid fly the plane?\" \"Yes,\" Casey said. \"John Chang permitted a pilot who was not type certified to fly the N-22. As a result, fifty-six people were injured and four people died - including John Chang himself. We believe that the aircraft was on autopilot, and Chang left his son momentarily in charge of the flight. That was when the disagree warning occurred, and the son extended the slats to clear it But the son panicked, overcorrected, and porpoised. Eventually we believe Thomas Chang was knocked unconscious by the severe movements of the airplane, and the autopilot took over.\" Malone said, \"On a commercial flight, some guy lets his fucking kid fly the plane?\" \"Yes,\" Casey said. \"That\u0027s the story?\u0027 \"Yes,\" Casey said. \"And you have the tape in your possession that proves it. Therefore you are aware of the facts. Mr. Reardon stated on camera that both he and his colleagues in New York have watched the tape in its entirety. So you have seen this shot of the cockpit. I have now informed you what that shot represents. We have provided you with corroborating evidence - not all the evidence, there\u0027s more. We have also demonstrated in flight test that there is nothing wrong with the aircraft itself.\" \"Not everyone agrees...\" she began. \"This is no longer a matter of opinion, Ms. Malone. It is a matter of fact. You are undeniably in possession of the facts. If Newsline does not report these facts, which you are now aware of, and if it makes any suggestion whatsoever that there is anything wrong with the N-22 aircraft based on this incident, we will sue you for reckless disregard and malicious intent. Ed Fuller is very conservative, but he thinks we will certainly win. Because you acquired the tape that proves our case. Now, would you like Mr. Fuller to call Mr. Shenk and explain the situation, or would you prefer to do it yourself?\" Malone said nothing. \"Ms. Malone?\" \"Where\u0027s a phone?\" she said. \"There\u0027s one in the corner.\" Malone got up, and walked over to the phone. Casey headed for the door. \"Jesus Christ,\" Malone said, shaking her head. \"The guy lets his kid fly a plane full of people? I mean, how can that happen?\" Casey shrugged. \"He loves his son. We believe he\u0027s allowed him to fly on other occasions. But there\u0027s a reason why commercial pilots are required to train extensively on specific equipment, to be type certified. He didn\u0027t know what he was doing, and he got caught.\" Casey closed the door, and thought: And so did you. YUMA 10:05 A.M. \"Jesus fucking Christ,\" Dick Shenk said. \"I got a hole in the show the size of Afghanistan and you\u0027re telling me you\u0027ve got a bad parts story? Featuring Yellow Peril Pilots? Is that what you\u0027re telling me, Jennifer? Because I\u0027m not going to run with that. I\u0027ll get murdered. I\u0027m not going to be the Pat Buchanan of the airwaves. Fuck that noise.\" \"Dick,\" she said. \"It doesn\u0027t really play that way. It\u0027s a family tragedy, the guy loves his son, and - \" \"But I can\u0027t use it,\" Shenk said. \"He\u0027s Chinese. I can\u0027t even go near it.\" \"The kid killed four people and injured fifty-six - \" \"What difference does that make? I\u0027m very disappointed in you, Jennifer,\" he said. \"Very, very disappointed. Do you realize what this means? This means I have to go with the gimp Little League segment.\" \"Dick,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t cause the accident, I\u0027m just reporting the story ...\" \"Wait a minute. What fresh bullshit is this?\" \"Dick, I - \" \"You\u0027re reporting your ineptitude, is what you\u0027re reporting,\" Shenk said. \"You fucked up, Jennifer. You had a hot story, a story I wanted, a story about a crappy American product, and two days later you come back with some horseshit about a whack. It\u0027s not the airplane, it\u0027s the pilot. And maintenance. And bad parts.\" \"Dick - \" \"I warned you, I didn\u0027t want bad parts. You fucked this one to death, Jennifer. We\u0027ll talk Monday.\" And he hung up. GLENDALE ll:00 p.m. Newsline\u0027s closing credits were running when Casey\u0027s phone rang. An unfamiliar, gruff voice said, \"Casey Singleton?\" \"Speaking.\" \"Hal Edgarton here.\" \"How are you, sir?\" \"I\u0027m in Hong Kong, and I\u0027ve just been told by one of my board members that Newsline did not run a Norton story tonight.\" \"That\u0027s right, sir.\" \"I\u0027m very pleased,\" he said. \"I wonder why they didn\u0027t run it?\" \"I have no idea,\" Casey said. \"Well, whatever you did, it was obviously effective,\" Edgarton said. \"I\u0027m leaving for Beijing in a few hours, to sign the sales agreement. John Marder was supposed to meet me there, but I\u0027m told that, for some reason, he hasn\u0027t left California.\" \"I don\u0027t know anything about that,\" she said. \"Good,\" Edgarton said. \"Glad to hear it. We\u0027ll be making some changes at Norton in the next few days. Meanwhile I wanted to congratulate you, Casey. You\u0027ve been under a lot of pressure. You\u0027ve done an outstanding job.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Hal.\" \"Thank you, Hal.\" \"My secretary will call to arrange lunch when I get back,\" he said. \"Keep up the good work.\" Edgarton hung up, and then there were other calls. From Mike Lee, congratulating her, in guarded tones. Asking how she managed to kill the story. She said she had nothing to do with it, that Newsline for some reason had decided not to run it. Then there were more calls, from Doherty, and Burne, and Ron Smith. And Norma, who said, \"Honey, I\u0027m proud of you.\" And finally Teddy Rawley, who said he happened to be in the neighborhood, and wondered what she was doing. \"I\u0027m really tired,\" Casey said \"Another time, okay?\" \"Aw, babe. It was a great day. Your day.\" \"Yeah, Teddy. But I\u0027m really tired.\" She took her phone off the hook, and went to bed. GLENDALE Sunday, 5:45 P.M. It was a clear evening. She was standing outside her bungalow, in the twilight, when Amos came up with his dog. The dog slobbered on her hand. \"So,\" Amos said. \"You dodged a bullet.\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"I guess so.\" \"Whole plant\u0027s talking. Everyone\u0027s saying you stood up to Marder. Wouldn\u0027t lie about 545. That true?\" \"More or less.\" \"Then you were stupid,\" Amos said. \"You should have lied. They lie. It\u0027s just a question of whose lie gets on the air.\" \"Amos...\" \"Your father was a journalist; you think there\u0027s some kind of truth to be told. There isn\u0027t. Not for years, kid. I watched those scum on the Aloha incident. All they wanted was the gory details. Stewardess gets sucked out of the plane, did she die before she hit the water? Was she still alive? That\u0027s all they wanted to know.\" \"Amos,\" she said. She wanted him to stop. \"I know,\" he said. \"That\u0027s entertainment. But I\u0027m telling you, Casey. You were lucky this time. You might not be as lucky next time. So don\u0027t let this become a habit. Remember: they make the rules. And the game\u0027s got nothing to do with accuracy, or the facts, or reality. It\u0027s just a circus.\" She wasn\u0027t going to argue with him. She petted the dog. \"Fact is,\" Amos said, \"everything\u0027s changing. Used to be - in the old days - the media image roughly corresponded to reality. But now it\u0027s all reversed. The media image is the reality, and by comparison day-to-day life seems to lack excitement. So now day-to-day life is false, and the media image is true. Sometimes I look around my living room, and the most real thing in the room is the television. It\u0027s bright and vivid, and the rest of my life looks drab. So I turn the damn thing off. That does it every time. Get my life back.\" Casey continued to pet the dog. She saw headlights in the darkening night swing around the corner, and come up the street toward them. She walked to the curb. \"Well, I\u0027m rambling,\" Amos said. \"Good night, Amos,\" she said. The car came to a stop. The door flung open. \"Mom!\" Her daughter jumped into her arms, wrapping her legs around her. \"Oh, Mom, I missed you!\" \"Me too, honey,\" she said. \"Me too.\" Jim got out of the car, handed Casey the backpack. In the near darkness, she couldn\u0027t really see his face. \"Good night,\" he said to her. \"Good night, Jim,\" she said. Her daughter took her hand. They started back inside. It was growing dark, and the air was cool. When she looked up, she saw the straight contrail of a passenger jet. It was so high, it was still in daylight, a thin white streak across the darkening sky.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-25.html","bookId":2409,"book":{"id":2409,"title":"Airframe","description":"Storyline: The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.
