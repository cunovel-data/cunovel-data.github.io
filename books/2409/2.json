She couldn\u0027t remember which side of the Norton family he was from, but she recognized the type. Plenty of money, divorced parents, an indifferent record at good schools, and an unshakable sense of entitlement.\n \"Casey Singleton,\" she said. \"Get in. We\u0027re late.\"\n \"Late,\" Richman said, as he climbed into the car. \"It\u0027s not even seven.\"\n \"First shift starts at six,\" Casey said. \"Most of us in QA work the factory schedule. Don\u0027t they do that at GM?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I was in Legal.\"\n \"Spend any time on the floor?\"\n \"As little as possible.\"\n Casey sighed. It was going to be a long six weeks with this guy, she thought. \"You\u0027ve been over in Marketing so far?\"\n \"Yeah, a few months.\" He shrugged. \"But selling isn\u0027t really my thing.\"\n She drove south toward Building 64, the huge structure where the widebody was built. Casey said, \"By the way, what do you drive?\"\n \"A BMW,\" Richman said.\n \"You might want to trade it in,\" she said, \"for an American car.\"\n \"Why? It\u0027s made here.\"\n \"It\u0027s assembled here,\" she said. \"It\u0027s not made here. The value\u0027s added overseas. The mechanics in the plant know the difference; they\u0027re all UAW. They don\u0027t like to see a Beamer in the parking lot.\"\n Richman stared out the window. \"What are you saying, something might happen to it?\u0027\n \"Guaranteed,\" she said. \"These guys don\u0027t screw around.\"\n \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" Richman said He suppressed a yawn. \"Jesus, it\u0027s early. What are we rushing to?\"\n \"The IRT. It\u0027s been pushed up to seven,\" she said.\n \u0027The Incident Review Team. Every time something happens to one of our planes, the IRT meets to figure out what happened, and what we should do about it\"\n \"How often do you meet?\u0027\n \"Roughly every two months.\"\n \"That often,\" the kid said.\n You \u0027re going to have to start him from the beginning.\n \"Actually,\" Casey said, \"two months is pretty infrequent. We have three thousand aircraft in revenue service around the world. With that many birds in the air, things happen. And we\u0027re serious about customer support. So every morning we hold a conference call with the service reps around the world. They report everything that caused a dispatch delay the day before. Most of it\u0027s minor stuff: a lav door jammed; a cockpit light failed. But we track it in QA, do a trend analysis, and pass that on to Product Support.\"\n \"Uh-huh . . .\" He sounded bored.\n \"Then,\" Casey said, \"once in a while, we hit a problem that warrants an IRT. It has to be serious, something that affects flight safety. Apparently we\u0027ve got one today. If Marder\u0027s pushed the meeting up to seven, you can bet it\u0027s not a bird strike.\"\n \"Marder?\"\n \"John Marder was the program manager for the widebody, before he became chief operating officer. So it\u0027s probably an incident involving the N-22.\"\n She pulled over and parked in the shadow of Building 64.\n The gray hangar loomed above them, eight stories high and nearly a mile long. The asphalt in front of the building was strewn with disposable earplugs, which the mechanics wore so they wouldn\u0027t go deaf from the rivet guns.\n They walked through the side doors and entered an interior corridor that ran around the perimeter of the building. The corridor was dotted with food dispensers, in clusters a quarter of a mile apart Richman said, \"We got time for a cup of coffee?\" She shook her head. \"Coffee\u0027s not allowed on the floor.\" \"No coffee?\" He groaned. \"Why not? It\u0027s made overseas?\" \"Coffee\u0027s corrosive. Aluminum doesn\u0027t like it.\" Casey led Richman through another door, onto the production floor. \"Jesus,\" Richman said.\n The huge, partially assembled widebody jets gleamed under halogen lights. Fifteen aircraft in various stages of construction were arranged in two long rows under the vaulted roof. Directly ahead of them, she saw mechanics installing cargo doors in the fuselage sections. The barrels of the fuselage were surrounded by scaffolding. Beyond the fuselage stood a forest of assembly jigs - immense tools, painted bright blue. Richman walked under one of the jigs and looked up, open-mouthed. It was as wide as a house and six stories tall.\n \"Amazing,\" he said. He pointed upward at a broad flat surface. \"Is that the wing?\"\n \"The vertical stabilizer,\" Casey said.\n \"The what?\"\n \"It\u0027s the tail, Bob.\"\n \"That\u0027s the tail\u0027 Richman said.\n Casey nodded. \"The wing is over there,\" she said, pointing across the floor. \"It\u0027s two hundred feet long - almost as long as a football field.\"\n A Klaxon sounded. One of the overhead cranes began to move. Richman turned to look.\n \"This your first time on the floor?\"\n \"Yeah ...\" Richman was turning around, looking in all directions. \"Awesome,\" he said.\n \"They\u0027re big,\" Casey said.\n \"Why are they all lime green?\"\n \"We coat the structural elements with epoxy to prevent corrosion. And the aluminum skins are covered so they don\u0027t get dinged during assembly. The skins are highly polished and very expensive. So we leave that coating on until Paint Shed.\"\n \"Sure doesn\u0027t look like GM,\" Richman said, still turning and looking.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Casey said. \"Compared to these aircraft, cars are a joke.\"\n Richman turned to her, surprised. \"A joke!\"\n \"Think about it,\" she said. \"A Pontiac has five thousand parts, and you can build one in two shifts. Sixteen hours. That\u0027s nothing. But these things\" - she gestured to the aircraft looming high above them - \"are a completely different animal. The widebody has one million parts and a span time of seventy-five days. No other manufactured product in the world has the complexity of a commercial aircraft. Nothing even comes close. And nothing is built to be as durable. You take a Pontiac and run it all day every day and see what happens. It\u0027ll fall apart in a few months. But we design our jets to fly for twenty years of trouble-free service, and we build them to twice the service life.\"\n \"Forty years?\" Richman said, incredulous. \"You build them to last forty years?\"\n Casey nodded. \"We\u0027ve still got lots of N-5s in service around the world - and we stopped building them in 1946. We\u0027ve got planes that have accumulated four times their design life - the equivalent of eighty years of service. Norton planes will do that. Douglas planes will do that. But no one else\u0027s birds will do that. You understand what I\u0027m saying?\"\n \"Wow,\" Richman said, swallowing.\n \"We call this the bird farm,\" Casey said. \"The planes\u0027re so big, it\u0027s hard to get a sense of the scale.\" She pointed to one aircraft to their right, where small clusters of people worked at various positions, with portable lights shining up on the metal. \"Doesn\u0027t look like many people, right?\"\n \"No, not many.\"\n \"There\u0027s probably two hundred mechanics working on that plane - enough to run an entire automobile line. But this is just one position on our line - and we have fifteen positions in all. There\u0027s five thousand people in this building, right now.\"\n The kid was shaking his head, amazed. \"It looks sort of empty.\"\n \"Unfortunately,\" Casey said, \"it is sort of empty. The wide-body line\u0027s running at sixty percent capacity - and three of those birds are white-tails.\"\n \"White-tails?\"\n \"Planes we\u0027re building without customers. We build at a minimum rate to keep the line open, and we haven\u0027t got all the orders we want. The Pacific Rim\u0027s the growth sector but with Japan in recession, that market\u0027s not placing orders. And everybody else is flying their planes longer. So business is very competitive. This way.\"\n She started up a flight of metal stairs, walking quickly. Richman followed her, footsteps clanging. They came to a landing, went up another flight. \"I\u0027m telling you this,\" she said, \"so you\u0027ll understand the meeting we\u0027re going into. We build the hell out of these planes. People here are proud of what they do. And they don\u0027t like it when something s wrong.\"\n They arrived at a catwalk high above the assembly floor, and walked toward a glass-walled room that seemed to be suspended from the roof. They came to the door. Casey opened it.\n \"And this,\" she said, \"is the War Room.\"\n WAR ROOM\n 7:01 A.M.\n She saw it freshly, through his eyes: a large conference room with gray indoor-outdoor carpeting, a round Formica table, tubular metal chairs. The walls were covered with bulletin boards, maps, and engineering charts. The far wall was glass, and overlooked the assembly line.\n Five men in ties and shirtsleeves were there, a secretary with a notepad, and John Marder, wearing a blue suit. She was surprised he was here; the COO rarely chaired IRTs. In person, Marder was dark, intense, in his mid forties, with slicked-back hair. He looked like a cobra about to strike.\n Casey said, \u0027This is my new assistant, Bob Richman.\"\n Marder stood up and said, \"Bob, welcome,\" and shook the kid\u0027s hand. He gave a rare smile. Apparently Marder, with his finely tuned sense of corporate politics, was ready to fawn over any Norton family member, even a nephew on loan. It made Casey wonder if this kid was more important than she thought he was.\n Marder introduced Richman to the others at the table. \"Doug Doherty, in charge of structure and mechanical...\" He gestured to an overweight man of forty-five, with a potbelly, bad complexion, and thick glasses. Doherty lived in a state of perpetual gloom; he spoke in a mournful monotone, and could always be counted on to report that everything was bad, and getting worse. Today he wore a checked shirt and a striped tie; he must have gotten out of the house before his wife saw him. Doherty gave Richman a sad, thoughtful nod.\n \"Nguyen Van Trung, avionics ...\" Trung was thirty, trim and quiet, self-contained. Casey liked him. The Vietnamese were the hardest-working people at the plant. The avionics guys were MIS specialists, involved with the aircraft computer programs. They represented the new wave at Norton: younger, better educated, better manners.\n \"Ken Burne, powerplant ...\" Kenny was red haired and freckled; his chin thrust forward, ready to fight. Notoriously profane and abusive, he was known in the plant as Easy Burne because of his quick temper.\n \"Ron Smith, electrical...\" Bald and timid, nervously fingering pens in his pocket. Ron was extremely competent; it often seemed he carried the schematics for the aircraft around in his head. But he was painfully shy. He lived with his invalid mother in Pasadena.\n \"Mike Lee, who represents the carrier ...\" A well dressed man of fifty, gray hair cropped short, in a blue blazer with a striped tie. Mike was a former Air Force pilot, a retired one-star general. He was TransPacific\u0027s rep at the plant.\n \"And Barbara Ross, with the notepad.\" The IRT secretary was in her forties, and overweight. She glared at Casey with open hostility. Casey ignored her.\n Marder waved the kid to a seat, and Casey sat down beside him. \"First item,\" Marder said \"Casey is now liaising QA to the IRT. Considering the way she handled the RTO at DFW, she\u0027ll be our press spokesman from now on. Any questions?\"\n Richman looked bewildered, shaking his head. Marder turned to him, and explained: \"Singleton did a good job with the press on a rejected takeoff at Dallas-Fort Worth last month. So she\u0027ll handle any press inquiries we get. Okay? We all on the same page? Let\u0027s get started. Barbara?\" The secretary handed around stapled packets of paper.\n \u0027Transpacific Flight 545,\" Marder said. \"An N-22, fuse number 271. Flight originated at Kaitak Hong Kong at 2200 hours yesterday. Uneventful takeoff, uneventful flight until approximately 0500 hours this morning, when the aircraft encountered what the pilot described as severe turbulence - \"\n There were groans throughout the room. \"Turbulence!\" The engineers shook their heads.\n \" - severe turbulence, producing extreme pitch excursions in flight.\"\n \"Ah, Christ,\" Burne said.\n \"The aircraft,\" Marder continued, \"made an emergency landing at LAX, and medical units were on hand. Our preliminary report indicates fifty-six injured, and three dead.\"\n \"Oh that\u0027s very bad,\" Doug Doherty said in a sad monotone, blinking behind his thick glasses. \"I suppose this means we\u0027ve got the NTSB on our backs,\" he said.\n Casey leaned over to Richman and whispered, \"National Transportation Safety Board usually gets involved when there are fatalities.\"\n \"Not in this case,\" Marder said. \"This is a foreign carrier, and the incident occurred in international airspace. NTSB has its hands full with the Colombia crash. We think they\u0027re going to pass on this one.\"\n \u0027Turbulence,\" Kenny Burne said, snorting. \"Is there any confirmation?\"\n \"No,\" Marder said. \"The plane was at thirty-seven thousand feet when the incident took place. No other aircraft at that altitude and position reported weather problems.\"\n \"Satellite weather maps?\" Casey said.\n \"Coming.\"\n \"What about the passengers?\" she said. \"Did the captain make an announcement? Was the seat-belt sign on?\"\n \"Nobody\u0027s interviewed the passengers yet. But our preliminary information suggests no announcement was made.\"\n Richman was looking bewildered again. Casey scribbled a note on her yellow pad, tilted it so he could read: No Turbulence.\n Trung said, \"Have we debriefed the pilot?\"\n \"No,\" Marder said. \"The flight crew caught a connecting flight out, and left the country.\"\n \"Oh great,\" Kenny Burne said, throwing his pencil on the table. \"Just great. We got a damn hit-and-run.\"\n \"Hold on, now,\" Mike Lee said, in a cool tone. \"On behalf of the carrier, I think we have to recognize the flight crew acted responsibly. They have no liability here; but they face possible litigation from the civil aviation authorities in Hong Kong, and they went home to deal with it\"\n Casey wrote: Flight Crew Unavailable.\n \"Do, uh, we know who the captain was?\u0027 Ron Smith asked timidly.\n \"We do,\" Mike Lee said. He consulted a leather notebook. \"His name is John Chang. Forty-five years old, resident of Hong Kong, six thousand hours\u0027 experience. He\u0027s Trans-Pacific\u0027s senior pilot for the N-22. Very skilled.\"\n \"Oh yeah?\" Burne said, leaning forward across the table. \"And when was he last recertified?\"\n \"Three months ago.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"Right here,\" Mike Lee said. \"On Norton flight simulators, by Norton instructors.\"\n Burne sat back, snorting unhappily.\n \"Do we know how he was rated?\" Casey asked.\n \"Outstanding,\" Lee said. \"You can check your records.\"\n Casey wrote: Not Human Error (?)\n Marder said to Lee, \"Do you think we can get an interview with him, Mike? Will he talk to our service rep at Kaitak?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure the crew will cooperate,\" Lee said. \"Especially if you submit written questions ... I\u0027m sure I can get them answered within ten days.\"\n \"Hmm,\" Marder said, distressed. \"That long...\"\n \"Unless we get a pilot interview,\" Van Trung said, \"we may have a problem. The incident occurred one hour prior to landing. The cockpit voice recorder only stores the last twenty-five minutes of conversation. So in this case the CVR is useless.\"\n \u0027True. But you still have the FDR.\"\n Casey wrote: Flight Data Recorder.\n \"Yes, we have the FDR,\" Trung said. But this clearly didn\u0027t assuage his concerns, and Casey knew why. Flight recorders were notoriously unreliable. In the media, they were the mysterious black boxes that revealed all the secrets of a flight. But in reality, they often didn\u0027t work.\n \"I\u0027ll do what I can,\" Mike Lee promised.\n Casey said, \"What do we know about the aircraft?\"\n \"Aircraft\u0027s brand-new,\" Marder said. \"Three years\u0027 service. It\u0027s got four thousand hours and nine hundred cycles.\"\n Casey wrote: Cycles \u003d Takeoffs and Landings.\n \"What about inspections?\" Doherty asked gloomily. \"I suppose we\u0027ll have to wait weeks for the records...\"\n \"It had a C check in March.\"\n \"Where?\u0027\n \"LAX.\"\n \"So maintenance was probably good,\" Casey said.\n \"Correct,\" Marder said. \"As a first cut, we can\u0027t attribute this to weather, human factors, or maintenance. So we\u0027re in the trenches. Let\u0027s run the fault tree. Did anything about this aircraft cause behavior that looks like turbulence? Structural?\"\n \"Oh sure,\" Doherty said miserably. \"A slats deploy would do it. We\u0027ll function hydraulics on all the control surfaces.\"\n \"Avionics?\"\n Trung was scribbling notes. \"Right now I\u0027m wondering why the autopilot didn\u0027t override the pilot. Soon as I get the FDR download, I\u0027ll know more.\"\n \"Electrical?\u0027\n \"It\u0027s possible we got a slats deploy from a sneak circuit,\" Ron Smith said, shaking his head. \"I mean, it\u0027s possible...\"\n \"Powerplant?\u0027\n \"Yeah, powerplant could be involved,\" Burne said, running his hand through his red hair. \"The thrust reversers could have deployed in flight. That\u0027d make the plane nose over and roll. But if the reversers deployed, there\u0027ll be residual damage. We\u0027ll check the sleeves.\"\n Casey looked down at her pad. She had written:\n Structural - Slats Deploy\n Hydraulics - Slats Deploy\n Avionics - Autopilot\n Electrical - Sneak Circuit\n Powerplant - Thrust Reversers\n That was basically every system on the aircraft.\n \"You\u0027ve got a lot of ground to cover,\" Marder said, standing and gathering his papers together. \"Don\u0027t let me keep you.\"\n \"Oh hell,\" Burne said. \"We\u0027ll nail this in a month, John. I\u0027m not worried.\"\n \"I am,\" Marder said. \"Because we don\u0027t have a month. We have a week.\"\n Cries around the table. \"A week!\"\n \"Jeez, John!\"\n \"Come on, John, you know an IRT always takes a month.\"\n \"Not this time,\" Marder said. \"Last Thursday our president, Hal Edgarton, received an LOI from the Beijing government to purchase fifty N-22s, with an option for another thirty. First delivery in eighteen months.\"\n There was stunned silence.\n The men all looked at each other. A big China sale had been rumored for months. The deal had been reported as \"imminent\" in various news accounts. But nobody at Norton really believed it.\n \"It\u0027s true,\" Marder said. \"And I don\u0027t need to tell you what it means. It\u0027s an eight-billion-dollar order from the fastest-growing airframe market in the world. It\u0027s four years of full-capacity production. It\u0027ll put this company on solid financial footing into the twenty-first century. It\u0027ll fund development for the N-22 stretch and the advanced N-XX widebody. Hal and I agree: this sale means the difference between life and death for the company.\" Marder placed the papers in his briefcase and snapped it shut.\n \"I fly to Beijing Sunday, to join Hal and sign the letter of intent with the minister of transport. He\u0027s going to want to know what happened to Flight 545. And I better be able to tell him, or he\u0027ll turn around and sign with Airbus. In which case I\u0027m in deep shit, this company is in deep shit - and everybody at this table is out of a job. The future of Norton Aircraft is riding on this investigation. So I don\u0027t want to hear anything but answers. And I want them inside a week. See you tomorrow.\"\n He turned on his heel and walked out of the room.\n WAR ROOM\n 7:27 A.M.\n \"What an asshole,\" Burne said. \"This is his idea of motivating the troops? Fuck him.\"\n Trung shrugged. \"It\u0027s the way he always is.\"\n \"What do you think?\" Smith said. \"I mean, this could be great, great news. Has Edgarton really got an LOI from China?\"\n \"I bet he does,\" Trung said. \"Because the plant\u0027s been quietly gearing up. They\u0027ve made another set of tools to fab the wing; the tools are about to be shipped to Atlanta. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s got a deal.\"\n \"What he\u0027s got,\" said Burne, \"is a major case of cover my ass.\"\n \"Meaning?\"\n \"Edgarton might have a tentative from Beijing. But eight billion dollars is a big order from a big gorilla. Boeing, Douglas, and Airbus are all chasing that order. The Chinese could give it to any of them at the last minute. That\u0027s their style. They do it all the time. So Edgarton\u0027s shitting rivets, worrying he won\u0027t close the deal and he\u0027ll have to tell the board he lost the big one. So what does he do? He lays it on Marder. And what does Marder do?\"\n \"Makes it our fault,\" Trung said.\n \"Right. This TPA flight puts them in perfect position. If they close with Beijing, they\u0027re heroes. But if the deal falls apart...\"\n \"It\u0027s because we blew it,\" Trung said.\n \"Right. We\u0027re the reason an eight-billion-dollar deal cratered.\"\n \"Well,\" Trung said, standing, \"I think we better look at that plane.\"\n ADMINISTRATION\n 9:12 A.M.\n Harold Edgarton, the newly appointed president of Norton Aircraft, was in his office on the tenth floor, staring out the window overlooking the plant, when John Marder walked in. Edgarton was a big man, an ex-fullback, with a ready smile and cold, watchful eyes. He had previously worked at Boeing, and had been brought in three months earlier to improve Norton\u0027s marketing.\n Edgarton turned, and frowned at Marder. \"This is a hell of a mess,\" he said. \"How many died?\"\n \"Three,\" Marder said.\n \"Christ,\" Edgarton said. He shook his head. \"Of all the times for this to happen. Did you brief the investigation team on the LOI? Tell them how urgent this is?\"\n \"I briefed them.\"\n \"And you\u0027ll clear it up this week?\"\n \"I\u0027m chairing the group myself. I\u0027ll get it done,\" Marder said.\n \"What about press?\" Edgarton was still worried. \"I don\u0027t want Media Relations handling this one. Benson\u0027s a drunk, the reporters all hate him. And the engineers can\u0027t do it. They don\u0027t speak English, for Christ\u0027s sake - \"\n \"I\u0027ve got it handled, Hal.\"\n \"You do? I don\u0027t want you talking to the fucking press. You\u0027re grounded.\"\n \"I understand,\" Marder said. \"I\u0027ve arranged for Singleton to do the press.\"\n \"Singleton? That QA woman?\" Edgarton said. \"I looked at that tape you gave me, where she talked to the reporters about the Dallas thing. She\u0027s pretty enough, but she comes off as a straight arrow.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s what we want, isn\u0027t it?\" Marder said. \"We want honest all-American, no-nonsense. And she\u0027s good on her feet, Hal.\"\n \"She\u0027d better be,\" Edgarton said. \"If the shit hits the fan, she has to perform.\"\n \"She will,\" Marder said.\n \"I don\u0027t want anything to undermine this China deal.\"\n \"Nobody does, Hal.\"\n Edgarton looked at Marder thoughtfully for a moment. \"You better be real clear about that,\" he said. \"Because I don\u0027t give a damn who you\u0027re married to - if this deal doesn\u0027t close, a lot of people are going to get taken out. Not just me. A lot of other heads will roll.\"\n \"I understand,\" Marder said.\n \"You picked the woman. She\u0027s your call. The Board knows it. If anything goes wrong with her, or the IRT - you\u0027re out on your ass.\"\n \"Nothing will go wrong,\" Marder said. \"It\u0027s under control.\"\n \"It damn well better be,\" Edgarton said, and turned away again to look out the window.\n Marder left the room.\n LAX MAINTENANCE HANGAR 21\n 9:48 A.M.\n The blue minivan crossed the runway and raced toward the line of maintenance hangars at Los Angeles Airport. From the rear of the nearest hangar, the yellow tail of the Transpacific widebody protruded, its emblem shining in the sun.\n The engineers began to talk excitedly as soon as they saw the plane. The minivan rolled into the hangar and came to a stop beneath the wing; the engineers piled out. The RAMS team was already at work, a half-dozen mechanics up on the wing, wearing harnesses, scrabbling on their hands and knees.\n \"Let\u0027s do it!\" Burne shouted, as he climbed a ladder to the wing. He made it sound like a battle cry. The other engineers scrambled up after him. Doherty followed last, climbing the ladder with a dejected air.\n Casey stepped out of the van with Richman. \"They all go right to the wing,\" Richman said.\n \"That\u0027s right. The wing\u0027s the most important part of an aircraft, and the most complicated structure. They\u0027ll look at it first, then do a visual inspect on the rest of the exterior. This way.\"\n \"Where are we going?\"\n \"Inside.\"\n Casey walked to the nose, and climbed a roll-in staircase to the forward cabin door, just behind the cockpit. As she came to the entrance, she smelled the nauseating odor of vomit.\n \"Jesus,\" Richman said, behind her.\n Casey went inside. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/airframe/page-2.html","bookId":2409,"book":{"id":2409,"title":"Airframe","description":"Storyline: \n The twin jet plane en route to Denver from Hong Kong is merely a green radar blip half an hour off the California coast when the call comes through to air traffic control: \n \u0027Socal Approach, this is TransPacific 545.
