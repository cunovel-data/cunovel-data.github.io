{"id":96637,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"We saw you following Nash away from school the other day,\" Ivy said the next day at the mall when we met by the food court for some girl time after school.\\n\\n \"You did?\" I asked. I was surprised they noticed and wasn\u0027t prepared to talk about it.\\n\\n \"Yes. Where were you guys going?\" Abby asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah, what\u0027s going on? A secret rendezvous with your old boyfriend?\" Ivy teased.\\n\\n \"Does Brandon know about this?\" Abby said as if she was worried about my boyfriend\u0027s feelings.\\n\\n \"Yes, he knows,\" I said.\\n\\n They both paused. \"So you did go somewhere with Nash?\" Ivy said. \"Do tell.\"\\n\\n \"It was no biggie. Really.\" But the fact was it really was major news. Nash was a werewolf, and he wanted to see if he\u0027d ever be cured. But now that he knew there was a possible antidote and he\u0027d be taking it on the upcoming full moon, he was a much happier person.\\n\\n However, I couldn\u0027t tell them about Dr. Meadows. They would want to know all sorts of information, and I was hoping to skate through the next week without incident. We only had a little over a week until the full moon appeared and I didn\u0027t need any more drama with my friends.\\n\\n \"Where did you guys go?\" Ivy insisted.\\n\\n \"Did you make out?\" Abby raised her eyebrows.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t one to lie - I always cracked a smile when I tried to even tell the slightest fib; or worse, I would break out in a rash. But I couldn\u0027t tell them what we really did.\\n\\n \"He just wanted to talk. That\u0027s all,\" I said.\\n\\n \"About what?\" Abby asked.\\n\\n I sighed. I hung out with Abby and Ivy to get my mind off my troubles. Instead they were pushing me back to the difficult thoughts of werewolves. I knew my friends would be persistent. I wasn\u0027t sure why I expected anything else.\\n\\n \"Ooh, there are those guys again,\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"What guys?\" I was happy to have the subject switched from me and Nash to anything else.\\n\\n \"Those thugs,\" Ivy said, pointing down to the first level. \"Totally gross!\"\\n\\n I saw the backs of a few guys talking to a pretty girl with a few shopping bags, but I couldn\u0027t tell who they were.\\n\\n \"We saw them yesterday outside the coffee shop. It was like they were deliberately pushing our buttons,\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"Maybe they were flirting,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t seem so. They were asking us strange questions,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"What sort of questions?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"All sorts. Did we like the outdoors?\" Ivy remembered.\\n\\n \"They asked me if I liked wolves,\" Abby added.\\n\\n \"That is weird,\" I said.\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t answer, just ignored them and walked on. Eventually they left us alone.\" Ivy took a breath. \"This one guy had tatts and spiky hair,\" she said. \"He was totally gross.\"\\n\\n \"I thought he was cute,\" Abby said, defending him.\\n\\n \"You did?\" Ivy asked, making a disgusted face. \"You would.\"\\n\\n When the girl moved on, the guys turned around. They were in plain view. I stepped closer to see them below. It was Ryder and his two friends. I froze. They seemed to be scanning the shoppers for something - or someone. Ryder continued to eye the shoppers, then suddenly glanced up and caught sight of me watching him. I lost my breath. He stared at me as if he\u0027d found what he was looking for. Just then Ivy pulled me toward the store and out of view.\\n\\n \"Uh...we have to leave,\" I said anxiously.\\n\\n \"Why? We haven\u0027t even bought anything yet,\" Ivy whined.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. We just do.\" I felt weird with those guys in the mall. Even with hundreds of people in the same place, I didn\u0027t feel safe. I must have appeared as if I\u0027d spotted a hungry zombie.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Ivy asked me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen them before, too,\" I confessed.\\n\\n \"You did?\" Ivy was shocked. She put her hands on her hips. \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"At the convenience store when I was getting gas.\"\\n\\n \"Which one?\" Ivy asked.\\n\\n \"The one in Westside.\"\\n\\n \"I meant which guy.\" Ivy rolled her eyes.\\n\\n \"Oh...Ryder.\"\\n\\n \"You know his name?\" Abby asked, intrigued.\\n\\n \"Why were you getting gas in the Westside?\" Ivy asked.\\n\\n \"I was on my way to Brandon\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t be stopping there,\" she warned.\\n\\n \"Who cares why she was there? How do you know his name?\" Abby wondered.\\n\\n \"He was bugging me - he was really rude. But then he introduced himself.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s weird,\" Ivy said. \"Promise you won\u0027t go there anymore.\"\\n\\n \"He was trying to pick you up,\" Abby said. \"He likes you.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t want to go out with him,\" I scoffed. \"Can we just leave?\"\\n\\n \"Why? They won\u0027t bother us again,\" Abby said. \"I\u0027m not going to let them spoil a good day of shopping.\"\\n\\n \"What if they come back to bother us?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll kick them with my brand-new heels,\" Abby said, holding a Macy\u0027s bag.\\n\\n \"Seriously,\" I said.\\n\\n Abby glanced around. \"They\u0027re gone.\"\\n\\n I inched a few steps toward the glass overlook; they\u0027d disappeared.\\n\\n \"I wonder who they are,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"We know one of them is Ryder,\" Ivy retorted.\\n\\n \"They aren\u0027t from around here, I know that,\" Abby said. \"They don\u0027t go to school here, and they appear to be around our age.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe they are juvies or homeless.\"\\n\\n \"They seem like they are searching for something,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"Trouble,\" Ivy said emphatically.\\n\\n Suddenly we spotted them coming up the escalator only fifty feet away.\\n\\n Ivy gasped. Then she pulled us into a lingerie store.\\n\\n \"Why do we have to hide in here?\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"They just spotted me,\" I said. \"I feel really weird.\"\\n\\n We hurried to the back of the store and hung out behind a display of bras.\\n\\n The guys came in.\\n\\n \"Can I help you?\" a saleswoman asked them.\\n\\n Ryder paused. \"You? No, I\u0027m not looking for you.\"\\n\\n \"They are following us!\" Ivy said.\\n\\n The woman gave him a puzzled expression as he glanced around.\\n\\n \"Did you see a girl with a pink headband in here?\"\\n\\n \"Honey, they all have headbands,\" she said. \"Feel free to check around.\"\\n\\n The saleswoman walked away from the guys and helped another customer.\\n\\n Abby tugged at our shirts. \"Quick,\" she said, and we raced into a fitting room.\\n\\n She locked the door, and we all stood on the bench.\\n\\n Ivy was panicking. Sure, we didn\u0027t know these guys, and no, he hadn\u0027t done anything to us besides being rude, but their vibe was deadly.\\n\\n \"Shh!\" Abby said. She put her hands over Ivy\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n We could see a shadow move by the door. Then it paused. Black boots poked through the bottom of our door.\\n\\n We all held our breath. I thought Ivy or I would faint.\\n\\n \"What is he doing here?\" Abby whispered. \"This is the ladies\u0027 changing room!\"\\n\\n Abby was ready to open the door and attack but I held her back.\\n\\n We were filled with fear as we waited.\\n\\n Then Ivy\u0027s cell phone rang.\\n\\n Ivy tried to cover her phone when the boots disappeared.\\n\\n \"Jake?\" Ivy whispered. \"These weird guys are following us. Can you come to the mall, now?\"\\n\\n Abby opened the door and peeked her head out. \"All clear.\"\\n\\n We sneaked out of the room and peered into the store. When we didn\u0027t see them, we walked through the aisles until we reached the entrance. We all gazed around; fortunately the guys were nowhere in sight.\\n\\n \"That was so creepy!\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"What does he want?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I think he wants you,\" Abby said, turning to me.\\n\\n \"Why?\" I asked. \"Why would you say that?\"\\n\\n \"Because he asked the clerk for you. You\u0027re wearing a pink headband.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why he wants me,\" I said, freaked out.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" Ivy said, putting her arm around my shoulder. \"He\u0027s gone. Let\u0027s banish those losers from our minds. Jake will be here soon. We have real men to talk about. What\u0027s up with you and Brandon?\"\\n\\n He\u0027s going to turn into a werewolf in a few days, I wanted to say. As if I didn\u0027t have enough to deal with already.\\n\\n I texted Brandon about meeting us at the mall, but he responded that he was taking his grandmother to the doctor.\\n\\n We waited until Jake and Dylan met us outside the store. They hung out with us as we continued to shop. Ivy\u0027s and Abby\u0027s minds quickly were distracted with things they could add to their spring wardrobes.\\n\\n I, however, had two particular things on my mind. Who was this Ryder guy, and what did he want with me? I met Brandon at his house after the mall. I was preoccupied by my frightening experience but was so relieved when I saw my handsome and strong boyfriend standing outside his guesthouse. I rushed to him and gave him a hug, my body caving into his. Apparently I couldn\u0027t hide my worries from Brandon, as he immediately gave me a curious look.\\n\\n \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t meet you at the mall. Your text sounded strange. Weren\u0027t you girls having fun?\"\\n\\n \"That rude guy from the gas station was there.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"He was following us.\"\\n\\n \"He was?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he gives me the creeps,\" I said with a shudder.\\n\\n \"Are you sure he is really following you? Or could it just be a coincidence?\" he asked in a tone that was trying to soothe me.\\n\\n \"He was bothering Ivy and Abby, too,\" I continued. \"They must be a gang of some sort. He was trying to talk to other girls at the mall as well. It\u0027s like he\u0027s trying to test us - or find someone special.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you are special,\" he said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious. He saw Ivy, Abby, and me at the mall. When we ducked into a store, he followed us in there. He even followed us into the girls\u0027 changing area.\"\\n\\n Brandon was visibly disturbed by this. He immediately changed his tone. \"That is weird. I wonder why he\u0027s doing that. I don\u0027t want you out of my sight,\" he said protectively.\\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll have to stay at my house and accompany me everywhere?\" I asked coyly.\\n\\n \"I can do that,\" he said.\\n\\n \"You can have a bed right next to mine.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll watch you all night.\"\\n\\n \"Would you?\"\\n\\n \"I would be glad to,\" he said. I leaned against his chest, comfortably engulfed by his protective arms. \"If he comes near you again, I\u0027m going to release the wolves.\"\\n\\n I felt relieved that Brandon was here with me. Without him I would be even more nervous. However, thinking about Ryder following us into the changing room area really made me anxious.\\n\\n I looked up at my handsome boyfriend. \"He wants something, Brandon,\" I said. \"And I think it\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he can\u0027t have you,\" he said, stroking my cheek. \"Someone already does.\"\\n\\n He leaned into me and kissed my fearful thoughts away.\\n\\n When I got home, I still couldn\u0027t completely shake off the odd behavior of Ryder and his crew. I knew he wasn\u0027t from around here - and it was unusual for three students to transfer to a new school together. And since they hadn\u0027t shown up at school, it made them all the more intriguing.\\n\\n I decided to take Champ for a walk and calm my nerves. As we headed down my street, Champ began to bark. I saw someone standing by the wooded area about fifty yards away. It was hard to make out who it was from my vantage point. I was hoping it was Brandon.\\n\\n Champ continued to bark. \"It\u0027s okay, boy,\" I said.\\n\\n I knew Nash was acting squirrely, so I assumed it was him.\\n\\n But as I drew closer, I didn\u0027t see Nash\u0027s blond hair or even someone unfamiliar. It wasn\u0027t Nash. And it wasn\u0027t even Dr. Meadows. Or a stranger. It was just someone strange. I gasped and held on tightly to Champ\u0027s leash. I couldn\u0027t believe my eyes. Fear ran through my flesh, and my heart began to pound out of my chest.\\n\\n \"Ryder?\" I said, startled.\\n\\n \"You remembered my name,\" he said with a churlish smile.\\n\\n \"Why are you following me?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Then what are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"Walking. Same as you.\"\\n\\n \"I was going - \" But then I realized I didn\u0027t want to tell him where I was going. I didn\u0027t want him to know where I lived, in case he was stalking me. \"Where are you going?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"You are the curious one. Most girls would have ignored me by this point. But you...you\u0027re inquisitive. I like that.\" He eyed me closely, his gaze sending chills down my spine.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to know why you are here. That\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"What if I said I was trying to talk to you?\" He was coy and quizzical.\\n\\n I was stunned that now he was so candid. That he admitted to it, and that my gut was right. \"Why?\" I asked as I inched away.\\n\\n \"Uh...I thought you were cute the other day.\" He grinned a sheepish grin. Ryder didn\u0027t budge; his confidence was as intriguing to me as much as it made me anxious.\\n\\n \"Thank you, but I\u0027m not interested.\" I tried to say it politely - enough to let him know where I stood but not too coarse to upset him.\\n\\n I snuck my cell phone out of my purse and pressed the button to speed dial Brandon.\\n\\n I waited for a moment, then said loudly, \"Well, I gotta go. It\u0027s probably best that you go on your way, too. Legend\u0027s Run can be sort of dangerous at this time of day.\"\\n\\n \"Are you serious?\" he said. \"This is the sunny suburbs. Nothing happens here.\"\\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s keep it that way.\" I said again in a loud voice.\\n\\n Ryder stepped closer. He locked his gaze with mine; I felt as if he would kiss me if he could. \"I\u0027m looking for someone. Someone like you.\"\\n\\n Just then I heard a car approaching. I was hoping it was someone I knew - one of our neighbors. If so, they might stop and notice I was talking to a stranger. I felt as awkward in the open with Ryder as I did alone in the woods that snowy day with the wolves. But they passed by.\\n\\n I clenched my fist.\\n\\n Suddenly I heard another car coming down the street. I was so relieved as this one was familiar.\\n\\n Ivy was driving her SUV and stopped alongside of me, where I was standing on the sidewalk. \"What\u0027s going on?\" she asked as she and Abby hopped out.\\n\\n I thought I\u0027d dialed Brandon - but instead I had dialed my best friend. Thank goodness she got the message and lived so close.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" Ivy asked Ryder.\\n\\n \"I came to town to see the Legend\u0027s Run Werewolf Festival. Is that a crime?\"\\n\\n \"No, I mean, what are you doing here?\" she reiterated.\\n\\n Two figures emerged from the same woods Ryder had come out of.\\n\\n \"Again, I\u0027m here for the fest,\" he said with a grin.\\n\\n \"Well, it doesn\u0027t start for a few more days, and it still doesn\u0027t explain why you are bothering our friend.\" Ivy was forceful and protective.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Abby said in her toughest voice.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry if that\u0027s the way it appeared,\" Ryder said, softening. \"I was just hoping to make some new friends while I was in town.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we have enough friends,\" Ivy said.\\n\\n Now Ryder\u0027s two friends were close behind him.\\n\\n Champ continued to bark even louder.\\n\\n \"Well, perhaps you can squeeze in a few more,\" Ryder said.\\n\\n Champ began to growl.\\n\\n Ryder stared at Champ, his gaze fixed with intensity. Champ stopped growling and sat down quietly.\\n\\n I was shocked. Brandon was able to do this all the time, and Nash had done the same thing only a few days ago to a barking Apollo. It wasn\u0027t normal. There could be only one reason Ryder had the power to do that.\\n\\n I held on to Champ\u0027s leash and moved back a few inches.\\n\\n Ivy and Abby seemed puzzled.\\n\\n \"What are you, a dog whisperer?\" Abby asked.\\n\\n \"Of sorts,\" he said cryptically.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t let on that I knew who - or what - he was. I couldn\u0027t say it in front of my friends.\\n\\n \"What were you doing in the woods?\" Ivy said.\\n\\n \"Hunting,\" the blond said with a laugh.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t hunt here!\" Abby scolded.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t use guns,\" the redhead chimed in.\\n\\n I felt creeped out by their insinuations, and I knew what they were talking about.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care what you use,\" Abby said. \"You need to go back where you came from.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re planning on being here for a bite longer...I mean bit,\" the blond said. The gang laughed at his joke.\\n\\n \"You guys are juvies,\" Ivy said. \"We have better things to do than talk to you. C\u0027mon, girls, let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n \"Wait - \" Ryder said. \"We got off on the wrong foot.\" He held out his hand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Ryder and this is Leopold,\" he said, referring to the scraggly blond. \"And this is Hunter,\" he said, gesturing toward the fiery redhead.\\n\\n The two guys waved and smiled.\\n\\n \"Hunter?\" Abby said with a laugh. \"Seems appropriate.\"\\n\\n \"Nice to meet you,\" Ivy said, polite enough. \"But we have to be going.\" She pulled me and Abby away from the guys and toward the SUV.\\n\\n But Ryder jogged after us.\\n\\n \"We wanted to know if you ladies would like to go out sometime,\" Ryder said, catching up to us at the car.\\n\\n Abby turned and gazed up at him. It wasn\u0027t the first time guys had ever flirted with us, and she always seemed to get a rise out of it. \"Our calendar is filled,\" she said to him coyly.\\n\\n \"Well, maybe you can cancel a few things,\" he insisted.\\n\\n \"Uh...I think not,\" Ivy said. \"We really have to go.\"\\n\\n Then Ryder stepped toward me. \"What about you?\" he asked, staring straight at me.\\n\\n \"She has a boyfriend,\" Abby said for me. \"And he\u0027s really big and strong.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t she speak for herself?\" Ryder asked.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Ivy began. \"You leave her alone. Leave us alone.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what tricks you put on to her dog. You must have one of those whistles that only dogs hear,\" Abby said.\\n\\n Ryder just smiled.\\n\\n \"And wolves, too,\" Leopold said.\\n\\n I could tell that Abby liked the attention slightly and couldn\u0027t help but flirt back with the guys. But I didn\u0027t want to give them any passes to hang out with us now or in the future.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you can find three single girls in town who would love to hang out with you guys,\" Ivy finally said.\\n\\n \"You think so?\" Hunter said.\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not so sure,\" Abby challenged with a mischievous smile. Everything was a game to her, and this was no exception.\\n\\n \"Yes, there will be some,\" Ivy said. \"We\u0027ve got to go.\"\\n\\n \"Are you so sure?\" Hunter asked.\\n\\n \"Come on, Ivy,\" I said. \"It\u0027s been lovely talking but we have to get home and study. We have school, you know.\"\\n\\n \"We hope to see you again,\" Ryder said.\\n\\n \"In your dreams,\" Ivy muttered.\\n\\n Ryder\u0027s comment left a feeling of uneasiness inside me. They hung back as we got into the SUV.\\n\\n When we were safely inside, we turned around. The guys were gone.\\n\\n I petted Champ, who growled as he stared toward the woods.\\n\\n \"Those guys were creepy!\" Ivy said as she drove off.\\n\\n \"I know. I wonder what they want,\" I said. The idea that Ryder could possibly be a werewolf frightened me. The full moon was only a week away.\\n\\n \"Yes, total stalkers,\" Ivy said. \"Like they have nothing to do but hang out in malls - and now the woods - accosting girls?\"\\n\\n \"I think that Ryder guy was hot. They all were,\" said Abby. She leaned against her seat, dreaming. \"If I wasn\u0027t going out with Dylan, I might like Ryder. Or maybe Hunter. Or maybe Leopold. Which one would you like?\" she said to Ivy.\\n\\n \"Gross, Abby! Besides, I love Jake.\"\\n\\n \"Duh. I know that, but if not.\"\\n\\n \"Ooh,\" she said. \"Not going there.\"\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon, Ivy!\" Abby said. \"You have to pick one.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess I\u0027d choose the redhead. I thought he was cute. I mean, no, I don\u0027t!\"\\n\\n \"You do!\" Abby squealed.\\n\\n \"Now you, Celeste.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027ve both done it,\" Ivy said, looking in the rearview mirror.\\n\\n \"Who would you choose?\" Abby pressed.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t bear to think about anyone besides Brandon. \"Brandon is the only guy for me,\" I said.\\n\\n Ivy pulled into Abby\u0027s driveway and turned off the engine.\\n\\n \"But if he didn\u0027t exist,\" Abby said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know - \"\\n\\n \"You have to say. We did,\" Ivy insisted. \"I\u0027m not letting you out until you do.\" She pressed the locks on the car.\\n\\n Ryder was different. He was unlike any guy in town - or that I\u0027d ever seen. He was edgy and had piercings and tattoos. I was intrigued by his style and brazen attitude, though put off by his rude behavior. Now that my friends put me on the spot, I couldn\u0027t help but wonder what I\u0027d think of him if I hadn\u0027t met Brandon. I thought long and hard. The three guys were each hot in their own right. But there was one who looked a lot like the guy I was already in love with. \"Ryder,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I knew it!\" Abby said. \"There\u0027s a connection there.\"\\n\\n \"There is not.\"\\n\\n \"I could feel it,\" she went on. \"He is so hot for you!\"\\n\\n \"No he\u0027s not. Don\u0027t say that. I love Brandon.\"\\n\\n \"Leave her alone,\" Ivy told Abby.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t even know me,\" I said.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t have to. It\u0027s your beauty and aura,\" Abby teased.\\n\\n Ivy unlocked the doors and we all got out. We went into Abby\u0027s house, and Pumpkin and Champ played around as we ate pizza. I continued to be distracted by our new situation. I think we had just come in contact with three more handsome, but freaky, werewolves.\\n\\n When I got home, I had a hard time shaking Ryder from my thoughts. The way he stared at me was no longer creepy - it was intense. It was as if he knew me - or wanted to know me. The part that bothered me was that it was slightly thrilling. He was so intense and confident, it was attractive.\\n\\n I\u0027d also never been exposed to someone like him. Was he a hood or a thug or just a misunderstood teen? He was the opposite of anyone I\u0027d ever been attracted to in my life. He lived on the edge, and though this usually turned me off, I found in this case I was battling myself because this time it didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I\u0027d had a crush on Nash for a few years before we dated. He was handsome. Popular. A basketball star.\\n\\n And I was so in love with Brandon, sometimes I couldn\u0027t see straight. I loved everything about him: the way he was compassionate toward animals, the times he helped his grandmother with groceries, how he wasn\u0027t afraid to put his life in harm\u0027s way. He really was the most courageous guy I\u0027d ever known.\\n\\n Ryder was also something out of the ordinary. I wasn\u0027t sure why he was so interested in me. I might not give him a second thought, since I was already in love with someone else, but there was this magnetic pull I had toward him that I couldn\u0027t shake. His edgy personality and intensity stuck with me; I was having a hard time getting him out of my mind.\\n\\n I wondered what it would be like if I\u0027d never met Brandon or Nash - that I\u0027d met Ryder instead. Would I be the kind of girl who would be pulled to someone who was so unlike myself? And live on the wild side with a dangerous and daring guy with spiky hair, tattoos, and more earrings than I wore?\\n\\n But I was in love with someone - and it wasn\u0027t him. It was Brandon. A handsome, rugged gentleman in his own right, with integrity and a zest for life and nature that appealed to me way more than a reckless, back-talking, attractive punk. I reminisced about being held in Brandon\u0027s powerful embrace and being lost when our lips touched and melted together. It wasn\u0027t long before I forgot all about a guy named Ryder. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-8.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) \\n Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
