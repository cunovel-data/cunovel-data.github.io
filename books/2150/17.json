{"id":96646,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"For the next month, everything was back to normal - as normal as it could be for a girl who was dating a guy from the Westside who was also a werewolf. Nash continued to be the star athlete in our school and never failed to try to tempt me to rekindle our relationship when he found an opportunity, while Ivy and Abby continued to plan their futures with Dylan and Jake. We three girls were still as close as we always were, talking about guys, love, and the latest fashions. And Brandon and I snuck kisses in between classes and explored the outdoors together after school. As the next full moon approached, Brandon received a new vial of serum from his scientist father, who had come for a visit. \"This is your vial,\" Dr. Maddox said, placing it in his son\u0027s hand. \"It\u0027s not for your friends. Or someone you might happen to meet in the next few days. It\u0027s not to be shared or given away. I made it for you. It\u0027s your cure. So you can be normal again.\" \"I\u0027m not sure I can ever be normal again after everything that has happened,\" Brandon said. \"These events have made your life richer, that\u0027s for sure,\" his father said. \"But you have so many things to look forward to - and I want you to be able to do them as yourself. Not some creature that has to hide in the woods.\" \"He\u0027s really not a creature - not like you\u0027d think,\" I said. \"He\u0027s as kind as a werewolf as he is as a human. That\u0027s why he shared it instead of taking it.\" Dr. Maddox tapped my shoulder. \"I\u0027m glad Brandon has you by his side. He\u0027s so lucky he found you. This move was good for him after all, even after everything else he\u0027s endured. \"I\u0027d stay and watch you take it this time,\" he said, \"but I have to return to Geneva before the moon hits its full appearance. However, this will be my last trip - I\u0027m making arrangements to stay here for good. It will be wonderful to have everything back to the way it was. Only instead of being in Miller\u0027s Glen, we\u0027ll be here.\" I wondered what it would be like if Brandon had the side effects Ryder had and became a werewolf full-time. What kind of life would we have? He wouldn\u0027t be able to go to school, and we\u0027d miss spending our days together. If others found out about him being a werewolf, he\u0027d be forced to live in isolation. He couldn\u0027t play hockey, hang out with others, or go to college. What kind of future would it be? I only hoped that he was cured like Nash and Ryder\u0027s crew. Then he could be human again - but I knew there would be a part of me that would miss those nocturnal moonlit kisses. On the first night of the next full moon, it was finally Brandon\u0027s turn to take the serum. I was as afraid for him as I had been for Nash and as much as I had been the first time I saw Brandon turn. Now he could possibly turn every night and begin an eternal battle within himself that he wouldn\u0027t be able to control. But then there was the other side - I was afraid that I\u0027d be losing the side of him that I\u0027d grown to love just as much. In fact, that was who Brandon was to me: a generous, courageous, thoughtful guy in class and a handsome, hot, heroic creature of the night. Could he be one without the other? For his sake, I hoped so, but I had to admit, I\u0027d always miss that side that I\u0027d fallen in love with as well. After sunset I found him standing up at the tree where I\u0027d seen him first turn. He was gorgeous in his werewolf form, his hair wildly long, his face dotted with manly hair, his chest strong and lean. He was holding the serum, staring at the antidote. He held his fate in his hands. \"Are you ready?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m not so sure,\" he lamented. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I reassured him. \"I\u0027m confident it will work like it did for Nash - and Leopold and Hunter.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m worried about.\" \"I\u0027m not sure I understand.\" \"The thought of being a werewolf every night terrifies me,\" he said, fixated on the vial, \"and the idea of never being one again makes me sad.\" \"Really?\" I asked. \"I feel the same way.\" \"You do?\" I nodded. \"I like you both ways.\" He was obviously touched and drew back my hair from my face. \"You are truly special. My dad was right - I am so lucky to have found you.\" We embraced as if we were holding on to all the parts of ourselves that we\u0027d come to know. \"So what are you going to do? Aren\u0027t you afraid of transforming again?\" \"I was when it first happened. But then - I had so much power, being able to explore nature as I never can as a human.\" He turned to me with sad and lonely eyes. I could see him struggling to decide who he really was now. Just as I had struggled, too, in preparing to give up some of the parts of him I loved. \"I\u0027m not ready to give up who I am, what I can be, and how I feel once in a full moon.\" I nodded my head. Truthfully it would be hard - three days out of the month hiding him away, being isolated or having to avoid making plans with friends. There would be challenges. But wasn\u0027t that what life was about anyway? \"I wouldn\u0027t want you any other way,\" I said genuinely. Brandon held the serum for a moment, then chucked it with all his might far into the woods. He drew me to him, his lycan fangs catching the moonlight. He leaned in and kissed me long and with such intensity I thought I might explode. He pulled me in to him with a powerful embrace; I didn\u0027t want to be anywhere else in the world but in his arms. I was going to be dating a werewolf for now and for the future. I didn\u0027t know what would happen the next day, but I knew it would be exciting. And we\u0027d always be destined for a romantic adventure every so often.... Or at least once in a full moon.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-17.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
