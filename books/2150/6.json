{"id":96635,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The next day, Nash seemed distracted in class, and at lunch he didn\u0027t make much eye contact. He was a bit moody and perhaps even depressed. As his friend, I didn\u0027t like to see him this way. His classwork and attention seemed to suffer. And I knew why - he was consumed by the impending full moon and its upcoming effects on him.\n I couldn\u0027t blame him. I felt awful for Brandon and for him. If he couldn\u0027t talk to anyone about it but me, I knew it was eating away at him. His animal instinct must have been getting stronger since the full moon was a little less than two weeks away.\n \"Nash has got to be on \u0027roids.\" I overheard Dylan telling Jake outside the gymnasium. \"Did you see him hit? Every time it\u0027s a home run. He\u0027s good, but not that good.\"\n \"It is odd,\" Jake said. \"But wouldn\u0027t he tell us if he was juicing?\"\n \"You\u0027d think so.\"\n \"Well, maybe he\u0027s just hitting better this season than last,\" Jake went on. \"He wouldn\u0027t jeopardize his future.\"\n The following day, after class, Nash found me alone at my locker. \"I want you to take me to that psychic,\" Nash said. \"She might know what will happen to me.\"\n \"Dr. Meadows?\" I asked, surprised.\n \"Yes. I need to see her. Immediately.\"\n \"What, right now?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But I have plans with Brandon.\"\n \"You always have plans with Brandon. I have to speak with this woman now.\"\n \"So go. No one\u0027s holding you back.\"\n \"I need you to go with me. I need to find a cure - and soon. Maybe she can help.\"\n I\u0027d feel odd taking Nash to the modern-day fortune-teller. Every time I\u0027d gone with someone else who wanted to consult Dr. Meadows, it was her advice to me that shook me up.\n \"I\u0027m sure you can handle this yourself,\" I said. \"She won\u0027t bite.\"\n However, Nash didn\u0027t like my joke and scowled. \"I need you,\" he said sincerely. \"I can\u0027t do this alone. Please, Celeste. Just this once?\"\n There was a little part of me that still got a thrill that Nash needed me. Not on the grand scale of true love but as a friend who needed a friend. I always like helping people, and it made me feel good that out of all the people in Nash\u0027s life, he still thought of me as the one closest to him.\n \"Besides, if I find out something, we may be able to help Brandon, too.\" Nash was totally genuine in his comment, and I was touched that he was thoughtful enough to help Brandon.\n \"Okay,\" I finally said. For once, Nash was putting someone besides himself first, and I was moved that he was changing for the better.\n \"And this time, just you and me,\" he told me. \"If we find out anything, you can share it with him.\"\n I agreed. Though the idea of going back to Dr. Meadows made me nervous, I hoped that maybe she could make us all feel better for a change.\n Before I headed out of school, I found Brandon by his locker. I was enamored at seeing Brandon; his brilliant blue eyes radiated through me. And I was so excited at being able to be in his presence every chance I got. I wasn\u0027t too happy to let one of those chances slip away, but I knew I had to do it for a friend.\n \"I have a favor to ask,\" I said in my sweetest voice.\n \"Sure. What\u0027s up?\" His dark hair hung down over his brow.\n \"Well, Nash wants to go to Dr. Meadows to find out if she knows of a cure and if he\u0027ll ever be cured or not.\"\n \"He wants to go to Dr. Meadows?\" he asked.\n I nodded.\n \"Is he going to tell her he\u0027s a werewolf?\" he whispered.\n \"No...I don\u0027t think so. He just wants her to give him advice.\"\n \"So why does he need to go to Dr. Meadows? Why not go to a therapist or a real doctor?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know...I guess because he\u0027s afraid they\u0027ll tell him he\u0027s crazy. And since Dr. Meadows gives readings, I think that\u0027s what he\u0027s looking for. Some sort of guidance.\"\n \"And Dr. Meadows can tell him?\" he asked as if I were as crazy as Nash.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said, shaking my head. \"She\u0027ll tell him something. If you give her money, she gives you a fortune.\"\n \"What does she know?\"\n In fact she knew a lot. \"I don\u0027t have to remind you, she was dead-on about the snowstorm, the wolves, and you saving me,\" referring to the time Brandon rescued me from the threat of a pack of wolves.\n \"I still think it\u0027s just coincidence,\" he said. \"Or too much reading into what she said.\"\n \"Nash is just looking for answers - for someone to help him. He\u0027s alone, like you were, too.\"\n Brandon\u0027s expression changed. I knew he was sympathetic to Nash\u0027s plight. Brandon was alone when he first transformed into a werewolf and now he at least had someone to share his experiences with - even if it was Nash.\n \"Fine, we\u0027ll go.\"\n \"Well, there\u0027s more to the favor,\" I began.\n Brandon appeared skeptical. \"He wants me to pay for it, too?\" he joked.\n \"He only wants me to go with him,\" I said.\n \"Alone? Just the two of you?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Why can\u0027t he go with Dylan or Jake?\"\n \"Because they don\u0027t know he\u0027s a werewolf. They still believe the event at the Moonlight Dance was a prank. And we really don\u0027t need them getting involved, do we?\"\n \"Of course he wants you to go. Can\u0027t you see? It\u0027s just a ploy to be alone with you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think it is. This time I really think he just wants answers - not to date me. Besides, we\u0027re taking separate cars. It won\u0027t take long, and I\u0027ll meet you right afterward. I promise nothing will happen. I\u0027ll just go to Penny for Your Thoughts and back.\"\n Normally, possessiveness wasn\u0027t something I\u0027d be attracted to in a boyfriend. But I could understand Brandon\u0027s concern - Nash was my former boyfriend and kept trying to get back together with me. I\u0027d be skeptical, too, if the situation were reversed.\n \"I watched you kiss him. Isn\u0027t that enough?\" Brandon asked.\n And there was that, too. Brandon had been more than understanding.\n \"Yes, it was,\" I said. \"But this isn\u0027t about his feelings for me at all. It\u0027s about him. He\u0027s so frightened now. He wasn\u0027t like you when you first went through this. He\u0027s afraid.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think I was?\" he asked. \"That I am?\"\n \"Of course, I didn\u0027t mean that. I just meant that you are so brave. Nash appears brave, but - \"\n \"I don\u0027t think anyone wants to be a werewolf,\" Brandon said emphatically.\n Brandon was right. Because he had been so courageous, I hadn\u0027t taken into consideration that it was still hard on him.\n \"Okay, I won\u0027t go,\" I said. \"He can figure it out on his own.\"\n It was obvious Brandon didn\u0027t want me to go. But I think he also didn\u0027t want to forbid me to go and now his jealousy turned to guilt.\n \"Fine. Go,\" he said. \"Just as long as you don\u0027t kiss him again.\"\n \"I won\u0027t even hug him,\" I agreed, and gave my boyfriend a warm embrace instead.\n I followed Nash\u0027s BMW in my car through the Westside and parked in front of Penny for Your Thoughts. It was strange hanging out with him in what he always referred to as the wrong side of town. But he seemed to be more preoccupied with his mission than his surroundings.\n \"Thanks again,\" he said sincerely when we met at the door.\n Colorful interplanetary mobiles and dream catchers hung brightly, and metaphysical books filled the shop\u0027s window.\n \"I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m doing this,\" he said, looking at the display. \"But I have no other choice. I hear she\u0027s been right about you guys.\"\n \"She has,\" I said, wishing she hadn\u0027t been.\n He opened the door for me, and the wind chimes echoed throughout the store.\n Nash glanced around, then headed straight for the register. He was bent on getting his reading done.\n When no one appeared, he was impatient. \"Where is she?\" he asked.\n \"Maybe she\u0027s with a client,\" I replied. \"Would you like to leave?\"\n \"No,\" he said. \"I\u0027m here to get the answers I didn\u0027t get at that old-folks home.\"\n \"Don\u0027t call it that,\" I said.\n He was fidgety and tapped his fingers on the counter. When she still didn\u0027t appear, he went to look at some of the books on the supernatural and paranormal. \"These were the same ones at the library,\" he said, holding up Witches and Werewolves. He sighed with discontent when he didn\u0027t find any new information.\n A few moments later, Dr. Meadows came out from the back room.\n She seemed surprised and delighted to find me waiting.\n \"Hello, Celeste,\" she said joyfully. \"It\u0027s great to see you. Have you come again for another reading?\"\n \"We\u0027re not here for me,\" I said. \"My friend wants a reading.\"\n Nash hurried over to the counter.\n \"Friend?\" she asked quizzically as if she was attempting to read our relationship.\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"Nash is quite excited.\"\n She seemed even more surprised to hear that Nash was the one making an appointment with her.\n \"Well, it\u0027s nice to meet you, Nash,\" she said, her glittery lashes twinkling.\n \"You, too,\" he replied.\n \"Come on back,\" she said eagerly. She gestured toward the reading room in the rear of her store.\n I followed Dr. Meadows, with Nash close behind.\n \"Is this your first reading?\" she asked him.\n \"Yes,\" he said as he entered the New Age room. \"And you come highly recommended.\"\n I believed now more than most. Everything she predicted had happened, and that was why I didn\u0027t want to come there. I wanted free will - and I didn\u0027t want her scaring me with her predictions.\n \"You\u0027re not going to put a hex or anything on me, are you?\" Nash said, sitting at the reading table.\n \"I don\u0027t do that. I\u0027m a reader. I can help guide your future.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly what I want,\" he said, relieved.\n \"Is there something specific you want to know about?\" she asked him.\n \"Yes,\" he said. Nash became very serious. \"I have this, uh...condition...and I want to know if there is a cure,\" he said cryptically.\n \"You mean for being in love?\" she asked with a laugh.\n Nash was shocked. \"Uh...no.\"\n \"It\u0027s written all over your face,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t need to be a psychic to read that.\" She looked at me and continued to laugh.\n I began to blush. But I wasn\u0027t about to tell her anything about why we were really there. She was already too interested in werewolves. She\u0027d tried stalking me and Brandon before. I didn\u0027t want her to add Nash to her list before we could cure them both.\n \"No,\" he said. \"That\u0027s not why I\u0027m here.\"\n \"It\u0027s not about love?\" she asked. \"Most people come here looking for those kinds of answers.\"\n \"No. I have this certain condition....\"\n \"Are you sure you don\u0027t need to see a medical doctor?\" she asked as if she didn\u0027t want to be responsible for mistreating something. \"Lots of teens have issues, and those are best solved...\"\n \"No - \" he said. \"It\u0027s not that, either. Oh...I thought you could help me.\" He began to become frustrated and turned to me. \"We better go - this was a mistake.\"\n \"I can help,\" she said. \"Please stay. And give me your hand.\"\n Nash turned back and reluctantly extended his hand.\n She rubbed her hands together to get them warmed up, her long purple fingernails catching the candlelight. She took his hand and held it. She matched his gaze, then closed her eyes.\n \"You want to know what to do,\" she said as if in a trance, \"when the full moon comes.\"\n \"Yes,\" he said enthusiastically. \"Yes.\"\n She closed her eyes. \"I feel here that your love line is very strong,\" she said, pressing on his palm. \"Very strong feelings you have for one particular person.\"\n Nash didn\u0027t want to know about his love life. And I didn\u0027t want her encouraging him to reunite with me.\n \"But there is something getting in the way,\" she continued, \"or someone. I sense a strong animal impulse.\"\n She opened her eyes. \"It\u0027s you,\" she said as if she was staring at a werewolf.\n \"It\u0027s me what?\" Nash was confused. And so was I.\n \"The wolf. I could feel it. You are the wolf.\" Dr. Meadows was serious.\n \"No - \" he refused.\n \"I thought it was the other boy - \" she said, looking at me. \"But it is you after all.\"\n \"I\u0027m not anything!\" Nash exclaimed, scooting back.\n \"I can help you,\" she said sincerely.\n \"You can?\"\n \"Yes, at the next full moon. Meet me at Willow Park. I will be there to help you through it.\"\n \"No,\" I said protectively. Not again. Dr. Meadows just wanted to catch a transformation on video so she could become a paranormal star.\n Nash wasn\u0027t about to wait for her to show up on the next full moon, either. Instead he reached for her again. \"Tell me what I\u0027m supposed to do. That\u0027s why I am here!\"\n It was as if Dr. Meadows didn\u0027t want to answer him. She wanted to use him for her own gain, just like she wanted to with Brandon.\n But Nash was persistent. \"Read my hand and tell me the answer I am looking for,\" he insisted.\n \"I can help you more if I am there with you.\"\n \"You can help me just fine now,\" he said. \"Take my hand.\" He held his hand out until she had no other choice but to grasp it or walk away.\n The psychic realized the severity of the situation. She placed his hand on hers again.\n Nash sighed with relief.\n Dr. Meadows drew a deep breath, trying to regain her trance mode. It took her a few seconds, but she seemed to be channeling something strong. \"I know what it is,\" she said. \"A cure.\"\n \"Yes,\" he said. \"Yes!\"\n \"You only have to take it.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t have one!\" he said.\n \"You must consume it!\"\n Then she snapped out of it and dropped his hand.\n \"But I don\u0027t have one,\" he reiterated. \"Where do I get it? Tell me where!\" He pushed his hand at her again.\n \"Your reading is done,\" she said.\n \"No, it isn\u0027t. You told me to take it. But how do I find it?\"\n \"I only can tell you to consume it.\"\n This time Nash reached across the table and grabbed her hand. \"Tell me!\"\n She was startled by his outburst. She struggled to pull her hand away, but he held on to her until she eventually relented. Then she closed her eyes again.\n She paused for a moment, and Nash and I waited with bated breath.\n Finally it was as if she was feeling a connection. \"It is closer than you think,\" she said. \"Just relax and the answer will unfold. But when the opportunity is revealed to you, the answer is yes. Take it. You will be normal again.\"\n Nash let out a huge sigh of relief. He let go of her hand, stood up, and reached over to the psychic.\n \"Thank you,\" he said. He gave her an enthusiastic hug.\n Dr. Meadows was startled by his display of affection. She suddenly was swept over by his embrace and became giggly, like any schoolgirl might. \"You should come in for readings more often,\" she said, taken in by Nash\u0027s charm.\n \"This was the only one I needed,\" he said enthusiastically. We left the room, and he handed her his money.\n \"And something for the lovely lady, too,\" Nash declared. \"Go on, Celeste. Pick out a necklace.\" He was so relieved by her prediction, all the sorrow he had been feeling was replaced with joy.\n \"Thanks anyway,\" I said. I was happy Nash was pleased and wanted to head to Brandon\u0027s before Dr. Meadows gave me any predictions.\n \"I\u0027ll get her something later,\" he said to Dr. Meadows.\n Dr. Meadows was beaming with her happy customer. As we began to leave, Dr. Meadows politely followed us out.\n Suddenly I saw purple fingernails on my arm and felt her hand grip me tightly. I tried to shift away before she could say anything to me but her hold was too tight.\n She locked her gaze with my own. \"Beware of the full moon,\" she said intensely. \"A werewolf wants to take you into his world. Forever.\"\n Nash and I gazed at each other in fear.\n Then she released her hand and smiled as if she had only said good-bye.\n Nash and I just waved and quickly left the store. Her words echoed in my head over the sounds of the clanging chimes as the door to Penny for Your Thoughts closed behind us.\n When we reached our cars, Nash stopped me before I opened my door.\n \"I want to thank you,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve done more for me than anyone in my life. Really.\"\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" I was eager to leave Dr. Meadows\u0027s storefront.\n \"It was a bit freaky - especially at the end. What do you think she meant?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m sure it meant nothing.\"\n \"But what you did meant everything,\" he said. \"She told me I\u0027ll get a cure, and I\u0027ll be back to normal. I can\u0027t wait until that happens. And I have you to thank.\"\n He was still holding my arm, and his fingers began to touch my elbow.\n It tickled, and chills ran through me. In a moment, Nash was going to kiss me.\n It was enough that I\u0027d gone somewhere alone with him when I was dating Brandon. I couldn\u0027t let my former boyfriend kiss me, too.\n His warm smile radiated, and it was hard not to be under his spell. But as he leaned in, I pulled back.\n \"I\u0027ve done enough today,\" I said, and opened my door.\n Nash waited as I got in and started the engine. As I took off for Brandon\u0027s, Nash waved, then headed for the Eastside.\n Dr. Meadows\u0027s words haunted me. They echoed in my mind. \"Beware of the full moon,\" she had said. \"A werewolf wants to take you into his world. Forever.\"\n Would Nash try to take me into the werewolf world before he was cured? Was he going to bite me under a full moon and make me transform? Every time I came to Penny for Your Thoughts, I left more frustrated and worried than when I had arrived. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-6.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) \n Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
