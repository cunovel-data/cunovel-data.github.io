{"id":96633,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"When we walked through the hallways before first bell the next day, I noticed students eyeing Brandon as if he were the school quarterback. \"Word must be spreading about the zoo,\" I said. \"You are getting stares.\" As we approached a few upperclassmen, one of the seniors caught sight of Brandon. \"Hey, dude - \" he said, high-fiving my boyfriend as they passed. Brandon turned to me as shocked as I was. When we got to class, I heard Abby talking to the girl seated next to her. \"It\u0027s like he\u0027s communicating with them,\" Abby said. \"He did that same stare when a wolf pack showed up at school,\" Ivy said. \"We saw that happen,\" Abby said. \"We were right there,\" Ivy went on. \"There he is!\" Abby said, now noticing us. Brandon turned red. He sat in his chair in the back of the room and busied himself with his notebooks. Later in the day, on our way to lunch, a few girls from the Eastside were hanging around us as if they wanted to talk to him. One girl pushed the other into Brandon. \"Excuse me,\" she said, embarrassed while her awaiting friends giggled. She gazed up at Brandon with crush-girl eyes. Then she scurried back to her friends. \"You touched him,\" one girl said as they continued to giggle. \"Now you can\u0027t wash that arm for a week.\" They all squealed to themselves and made their way to class. \"So now you have groupies,\" I said. I did think it was sweet that the girls thought Brandon was a dreamboat - just like I had always thought he was. Brandon didn\u0027t boast, but the students hung on his every word as if they were meeting a celebrity. Following that, a few freshman boys approached Brandon. \"Can I take a picture with you?\" one asked. Brandon was taken aback by the question. \"Uh, yeah, I guess.\" The boy quickly stood at his side and made a peace-sign gesture as his friend snapped a picture of them together. \"Now it\u0027s my turn,\" the other said. \"Okay...\" Brandon did the same. I watched as my boyfriend was being treated like he was on the red carpet of a movie premiere. When we finally got to lunch, the rest of our group was already eating. Two freshmen came up to Brandon. \"We heard what you did. That was major cool. Could you sign this?\" He handed Brandon a notebook. Brandon quickly scribbled his name. \"This is getting crazy,\" Brandon said. \"I\u0027m not a hero.\" \"Uh, yes, you are,\" Ivy said. \"Well, I just want to be like everyone else,\" Brandon said. \"Then don\u0027t jump in cages and talk to wolves,\" Jake teased. When another kid came up, Dylan rolled his eyes. \"Dude - he\u0027s eating,\" Dylan said. \"Give the man some space. He\u0027ll be signing autographs in the theater during fifth bell.\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll see you then.\" The boy seemed pleased and went back to his table, and Dylan and Jake laughed. Nash couldn\u0027t help but scowl. He tried to hide his disdain for the attention Brandon was receiving by bringing up other subjects. \"We have some tough games coming up. We\u0027re going to have to really hustle to beat Huntington Saturday.\" But Ivy and Abby weren\u0027t keen to talk about games they weren\u0027t playing. \"The Werewolf Fest is only three weeks away,\" Abby said. \"I can\u0027t wait to go!\" \"Me, too,\" Ivy said. \"It\u0027s going to be so much fun!\" Nash turned to my friends. \"What\u0027s so great about werewolves?\" he asked. \"Well, it seems like you like them,\" Ivy shot back. \"You and Brandon were the ones who dressed up like them at the dance.\" \"Oh yeah,\" he said. \"But that wasn\u0027t so much fun after all.\" \"Well, you had us all fooled. We thought for a while you might be the Legend\u0027s Run werewolf reincarnated,\" Jake said. We all laughed. If they only knew, I thought. If they only knew. I was leaving my last class and heading to my locker when I saw Heidi Rosen talking to Brandon by his. I quickly hurried over, as she was twisting her hair in major flirt mode. She had her hand on his forearm and then, when she caught sight of me, she smiled sweetly at him and turned and walked away. \"What was Heidi doing talking to you?\" I asked. \"She said she heard about what happened yesterday at the zoo. And that she only wished she had been there to see it.\" \"Weird. She never talks to us.\" \"Then she invited me to her party this weekend.\" I was shocked and hurt. A streak of jealousy scorched through my veins. I didn\u0027t like another girl inviting my boyfriend to her party when she was clearly not inviting me, too. \"Are you going to go?\" I asked nervously. \"Uh...no. I told her I had plans.\" I breathed a sigh of relief. \"It\u0027s really strange. Not only has becoming a lycan changed my behavior but the behavior of the other kids, too.\" \"I know. But you deserve fame and fortune.\" \"I don\u0027t,\" he said. \"Not really. Anyone would have done the same thing in my situation.\" \"No,\" I said, \"not anyone.\" Brandon couldn\u0027t be just like anyone else now that he was a werewolf. And because he used his strength and powers for the good of others instead of becoming a monster like Nash had only made him that much dearer to me. \"I don\u0027t want this attention. It\u0027s not normal,\" he said. \"But I do like helping people.\" Brandon was clearly astonished that saving the boy at the zoo had brought him sudden fame. So it wasn\u0027t just the full moon that changed his life - everything was different now. \"You can be a hero, too, as a human,\" I said. \"You saved me from the wolves before you were...\" \"Bitten.\" \"And if you hadn\u0027t, none of this would have happened.\" I still felt guilty for being the cause of his torment. If I\u0027d heeded Dr. Meadows\u0027s warning, Brandon wouldn\u0027t have to deal with this condition. \"But then you might not be standing here,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t worry.\" He took my hand. \"I don\u0027t regret it for a minute.\" I squeezed his hand back. \"It\u0027s only three weeks to the next full moon,\" I assured him. \"You\u0027ll take the serum and all this might go away.\" \"I\u0027ll take the serum,\" he continued. \"And then we\u0027ll know. Right?\" \"And maybe we can get more for Nash.\" \"Always thinking of others,\" he said. I shrugged my shoulders. \"But I agree. We need to help him be cured just as much as we need to make sure I am.\" I put my arm around his waist and leaned into him. He was as giving as I\u0027d want any boyfriend to be, as good a person as he was a sexy werewolf. I knew I\u0027d miss the side of Brandon that came out under the full moon, but it was more important for him to lead a normal life than it was for me to get a werewolf\u0027s kiss. The following Monday, Brandon caught up to me before school. \"My father is coming again,\" he said. \"This Friday.\" \"That is great news,\" I said. \"I bet you\u0027ll be glad to see him.\" \"I will be. But...\" \"But what?\" \"I think he\u0027s coming because I didn\u0027t take the serum during the last full moon. He\u0027s on his way to New York for a meeting but is stopping here first. He doesn\u0027t understand why I didn\u0027t take the medicine then.\" \"Well, you had good reason. We were trying to help Nash remember, and we needed you to be in werewolf form. And it\u0027s less than three weeks to the next full moon. Let him know you\u0027ll take it then.\" \"I will. But I kind of feel bad. He made this for me so quickly, and I didn\u0027t use it.\" \"He\u0027ll understand.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure. He doesn\u0027t like it when I don\u0027t do what he says.\" \"No parent does,\" I said. \"But since he is coming, I\u0027ll talk to him about making some more serum for Nash.\" Brandon had told me a few days ago that he would ask his dad for more serum, but hearing him say it again - when his father was coming into town - made it really hit home. Maybe we really could help Nash after all. \"You would do that for him? You are amazing.\" I was so pleased that Brandon saw the urgency in the situation and wanted to help Nash again. \"It\u0027s so generous of you. He doesn\u0027t have anyone helping him out.\" \"Except you,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t feel like I\u0027m much help. Besides, you\u0027d be the one really helping him. And your father.\" \"I understand what he\u0027s going through. He really wants a chance to be normal again. I know he wants it as badly as I do, if not more.\" \"You don\u0027t want it as much as Nash does?\" I pressed him. This time he shrugged his shoulders. \"Being able to communicate with wolves has its advantages.\" I was excited that he finally admitted to me a part of what he liked about being a lycan. \"But there are just as many downsides,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s worth it.\" \"Well, regardless, you\u0027ll always be my alpha male.\" Nash found me taking my study hall in the library as I was trying to catch up on some of my homework. Studying and my lessons were taking a backseat to all the chaos that was going on around me. Luckily I managed to stay focused in class and keep up with my lessons as much as I could so I hadn\u0027t fallen too far behind. I knew my grades needed to remain high as these last two years of school were so important for my entrance into college. He sat down beside me with some books in tow: Witches and Werewolves and Supernatural Creatures and Their Heritage. \"That\u0027s not your usual reading,\" I commented. \"I\u0027d expect you to be reading Sports Illustrated.\" \"I\u0027m trying to find some way to fix this. The next full moon is only a few weeks away,\" he whispered, setting the books down on the table. He was dreading his impending transformation. I could see it in his eyes. They were intense and focused on finding answers. \"Is Brandon trying to get some answers, too?\" he asked. \"Yes, he\u0027s trying,\" I said. \"My parents are getting suspicious. My dad says I eat like an elephant, and my mom says I\u0027m eating her out of house and home.\" I nodded. \"That is happening to Brandon, too.\" \"And I\u0027m starting to run faster at practice and hit farther than I have before.\" \"Wow,\" I said, \"you must like that.\" \"I do. I want to be great. But is hitting home runs worth what I have to go through once a month? The coach thinks I\u0027m juicing,\" he said. \"I could get kicked off the team. Yes, I want to be fast and strong, but not like this. Besides, I can\u0027t be a major league player and not be able to play during a full moon because I\u0027m hiding in the woods like a dog.\" Nash was tense, and he brushed his hand through his hair anxiously. I felt for him and really wanted to see his pain and stress go away. He opened one of the books. \"I\u0027m hoping there is something in here that can help. I\u0027ve searched the internet, but nothing has helped me figure this out. I ran and ran to purge my body of this strength and energy, but I didn\u0027t even get tired. I just wound up feeling more energized.\" \"Have you gone to a doctor?\" I asked. \"Are you crazy? They\u0027d lock me up. I don\u0027t want to be in a funny farm. I\u0027d rather hide in the woods.\" I shook my head, almost in despair. \"What is Brandon doing - besides saving kids? I bet he likes this, doesn\u0027t he?\" \"Why would you say such a thing?\" \"C\u0027mon, you can tell me. It\u0027s obvious. He can be a hero.\" \"He\u0027s not like that at all.\" \"Aww...he likes this stuff. I can see it. Charming the wolves and getting all this attention. No one knew who he was a few weeks ago - except for you.\" \"How can you be so callous?\" I asked. \"If anyone would understand, I\u0027d think it would be you. This has been hell for him, too.\" He nodded his head. \"You\u0027re right. My moods are so erratic. You have to take what I say with a grain of salt. I don\u0027t always feel like myself, you know?\" \"I know - this is really frustrating for you both.\" \"So has Brandon found anything worth trying?\" he asked. I wanted to tell him so badly about Brandon\u0027s father and the possible cure, but I couldn\u0027t. It was privileged information, and it wasn\u0027t my news to tell. I could only assure Nash that I was here to help and anything that I could do, I would. \"Nothing that\u0027s certain yet. If we do find something that works - you\u0027ll be the first to know.\" \"The full moon is coming. Less than three weeks away. I can\u0027t go through this again, Celeste.\" I sat in the library with him as he checked through the books for ideas. Once again I was distracted from my homework, busy dealing with the effects of being friends with the new generation of Legend\u0027s Run\u0027s werewolves. A few days passed and I was looking forward to Dr. Maddox\u0027s arrival on Friday, hoping he could help Brandon. Since Dr. Maddox was going to be coming to town on a late flight, Brandon invited me over to his house for dinner and to wait for his father. Brandon\u0027s grandparents were dining out with another couple, so we\u0027d have the place to ourselves. Brandon and I had a cozy meal together in the kitchen. \"It\u0027s like our own home,\" I said, checking on cookies I\u0027d placed in the oven. He drew me in and pulled some cookie dough off my fingers. Then he ate the cookie dough. \"Yum,\" he said. He leaned into me and kissed me. I hugged him and patted him with an oven mitt I had on one hand. \"It would be cool to have our own place someday,\" he said suddenly. \"You think so?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" he said. I was so touched that Brandon was thinking about the future - our future. \"Ivy and Abby were talking about college and how we all should go to the same university,\" I said. \"I hadn\u0027t thought about that.\" \"College?\" \"Ivy and Abby,\" he said. \"But that\u0027s flattering that they\u0027d like to include me.\" \"I think you are growing on them. Finding Abby\u0027s dog. Saving a little boy\u0027s life. What\u0027s not to like about you?\" \"The fact that I\u0027m a werewolf,\" he said. Suddenly his mood changed. \"But we\u0027re trying to fix that.\" \"I know. On one hand, I want to take the serum and get it over with - see if it really works. On the other hand, I dread it. If it doesn\u0027t work - \" \"We don\u0027t have to think of that now. Let\u0027s plan on it working.\" He laid his hand on top of mine. \"I still feel guilty about not taking it last full moon. My dad made this cure for me, and I didn\u0027t take it. I\u0027m sure he\u0027s really upset.\" \"I\u0027m sure once you explain, he\u0027ll understand. He\u0027s coming here tonight to help. And besides, he\u0027s your father. You must miss him. It will be great for you to have him here with you.\" \"I do. He\u0027s a great guy - a great dad. I just know how he looked at me the last time he was here. With fear in his eyes. He\u0027s afraid of me - his only son.\" \"He\u0027s not afraid anymore,\" I said. \"He is coming back.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure. It\u0027s not natural to have a son who is a werewolf.\" \"Well, we are working on that, aren\u0027t we?\" \"Yes, but mostly he is. And I\u0027m the one who resisted his help.\" \"But there is another full moon coming soon. Don\u0027t beat yourself up. You can take it then.\" \"You are really something,\" he said. \"Most girls I\u0027ve met are only interested in shopping and partying. You are so understanding. Most girls would run from a werewolf, not date one.\" \"Well, how can I resist one as cute as you?\" I asked coyly. \"I\u0027ve been dying to do this all day.\" He sat at the table and pulled me onto his lap and we kissed. Then we cleared our dishes and put them in the dishwasher. I imagined for a moment that this was our home. Brandon and me living in the country. A house with character and dogs barking in the backyard, a flower garden, and a wooded area behind the house like Brandon had now. And what if he couldn\u0027t change back to normal and he was this way always? Wouldn\u0027t it be good for those times when it was a full moon to live in an out-of-the-way spot with a lot of land and a small forest behind the house to run alongside wolves without neighbors knowing? It might be possible to live our lives that way, if we had to. And if we had to, I was up for the challenge. The doorbell rang, yanking me out of my fantasy and back into reality. Brandon headed into the front room, and I followed. He opened the door, and Dr. Maddox stood there with a warm smile on his face. He embraced his son. \"Great to see you, Brandon,\" he said, patting him on the back as they hugged. \"You, too, Dad,\" Brandon replied. \"Hi, Celeste,\" Brandon\u0027s father said to me. \"Hi, Dr. Maddox,\" I said. \"Wow, something smells delicious,\" he remarked. \"Celeste just baked chocolate-chip cookies,\" Brandon said. \"Would you like some?\" \"I bet you are hungry from traveling,\" I said. \"We have leftovers from dinner, too. We could heat them up for you.\" \"No, thank you - but those cookies - that will be great.\" I went into the kitchen while the two Maddox men reunited. I came back into the family room with a full plate of cookies and handed Dr. Maddox a small plate and a napkin. \"Thank you,\" he said, settling in on the sofa. He took a cookie and bit into it. He grinned, delighted. \"These are delicious,\" he said between chewing. \"You are quite the cook.\" \"It\u0027s just from a package,\" I admitted. \"Well, I\u0027m still very impressed,\" he said. Brandon scooted over, and I sat next to him on the love seat. \"So how have you been?\" Brandon\u0027s father asked. \"You sure look good.\" \"I feel okay,\" Brandon said. \"Celeste seems to be taking good care of you,\" he remarked. \"She is,\" Brandon said. \"But how is everything else? Do you still have the lycan symptoms under a full moon?\" \"If you mean \u0027turning into a werewolf\u0027 are lycan symptoms?\" Brandon joked. \"Then, yes.\" Dr. Maddox didn\u0027t laugh. \"How are you feeling on a daily basis?\" \"Hungry. I\u0027m always hungry. I can see in the dark, and I feel compelled to sleep outside, even though I don\u0027t.\" \"So your daily symptoms are getting stronger?\" \"I guess you could say that.\" \"He can communicate with wolves,\" I added proudly. \"Really?\" Dr. Maddox asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"And other canines. He\u0027s very powerful. He saved a boy at the zoo the other day.\" \"Interesting,\" Dr. Maddox said. He put down his empty plate and pulled out his phone. He made a few notes on it. \"What happened exactly, Brandon?\" \"I don\u0027t know...I just heard a scream, and then I sensed something - wolves in the distance being threatened. I didn\u0027t have much time to think. Before I knew it, I was in an enclosure at the zoo staring at a pack of wolves. There was a boy lying on the grassy embankment - he was hurt and unconscious. I wasn\u0027t sure about his injuries, but I didn\u0027t want the wolves to attack him - nor did I want the boy to be afraid if he woke up. I let the wolves know that they weren\u0027t threatened.\" \"How did you do that?\" he asked incredulously. \"Uh...I guess telepathically.\" \"So it is still happening,\" his father went on. \"I didn\u0027t take the serum. I told you.\" \"I know. But I thought your symptoms might wane. The restless nights and the like. But I didn\u0027t realize you had other abilities, like communicating with wolves. How do you do that?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t explain it. I just make eye contact with them, like I would a human. Only I can sense how they feel and what they are thinking. And somehow they know what I\u0027m thinking, too.\" \"And they listen,\" I chimed in. \"He\u0027s the alpha male in the pack,\" I told Dr. Maddox proudly. \"This is so interesting. I can\u0027t believe it. If you weren\u0027t telling me - if you weren\u0027t my son, I wouldn\u0027t believe it.\" \"I wish it were all a prank,\" Brandon said. \"I think we\u0027ll have to run some tests. I have to see this and document it.\" This made me think of Dr. Meadows and her request, which had alarmed me. She wanted to film Brandon\u0027s transformation. But Dr. Maddox was a scientist and Brandon\u0027s father. He didn\u0027t want to exploit his son for his own gain. \"I was hoping you would have taken the serum and have been back to normal. But since you haven\u0027t, I think we need to talk.\" \"Yes?\" Brandon asked. \"I want to know why you haven\u0027t taken it,\" Dr. Maddox said, sitting up. \"I thought you would have on the last full moon. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I wanted to know why and make sure you were okay.\" \"We think there is another werewolf,\" Brandon confessed. \"In fact, we know there is one.\" \"You have to be kidding,\" his father said. \"I\u0027m not,\" Brandon replied. \"Who is this person?\" his father wondered. \"Another guy at school. Nash, Celeste\u0027s old boyfriend.\" \"You seem to have quite a history with werewolves,\" his father remarked. We all half chuckled, relieving some of the tension. \"So I wanted to wait,\" Brandon said. \"To make sure he didn\u0027t harm Celeste.\" \"But don\u0027t you think you can be yourself and handle these situations?\" Brandon\u0027s father asked. \"Of course...but it does help to be strong,\" Brandon replied. \"And with my communication abilities, I thought I stood a better chance at controlling Nash\u0027s werewolf behavior.\" \"At some point, you have to be yourself and do what is best for you,\" Dr. Maddox said firmly. \"Maybe this is me,\" Brandon responded sullenly. \"I can\u0027t be cured and then have Celeste in harm\u0027s way with another werewolf.\" \"Well, maybe you can,\" he tried to assure Brandon. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I guess I could. I just was thinking I\u0027d be stronger if I...Look, he was also bitten. I saw it happen. I tried to stop it, but I only got there in time for us to stop the wolf before Nash was killed.\" \"Brandon saved his life,\" I interjected proudly. \"Just like he saved the boy at the zoo. And he saved me when I was lost in the woods. Brandon has been like a superhero in this town.\" Brandon\u0027s father tapped him on the knee. \"You are terrific,\" he said. \"All the problems you are going through, and you have the wherewithal to use your condition to help others. I am truly proud of you.\" Brandon\u0027s cheeks flushed red. I know he wouldn\u0027t admit that getting props from his father meant a lot to him, but he couldn\u0027t hide his proud expression. \"And there\u0027s something else, Dad,\" Brandon said. \"Now Nash is looking to be cured as well. I want to know, can we give him some of the serum?\" \"I made that serum for you. I want you to be normal. Then we can go about seeking cures for your friends. What you have is only enough for one dose. And that dose is for you to take. And if you take the serum, you can prove its effectiveness. Then I can go and make another dose. But for now - I can\u0027t give out medication to a minor without considering many legal issues. You understand that, right?\" \"I understand. But can\u0027t you make more?\" Brandon asked. \"I did the best I could in the short time I had to create a possible antidote. It\u0027s made from wolf DNA and human DNA. There was no one to test it on, I\u0027m afraid. Just a few mice.\" \"Werewolf mice?\" Brandon asked with a laugh. \"Creepy,\" I said, imagining their appearance. \"I injected five lab mice with wolf DNA and saliva from a rabid wolf. I used intense reflected light to simulate moonlight and manipulated the magnetic field around their cage to re-create the full moon\u0027s gravitational effects on the earth. Within a few minutes, the mice began to grow canine fur. Their muscles also grew stronger and they were much faster than normal. A few days later, I injected the serum, which contained particles of moondust I got from a scientist at NASA. Nothing happened. But when I injected it after their hair was turned under the moonlight, the antidote worked on four of them. They turned back into normal mice.\" \"But what about the fifth one?\" Brandon asked. \"He still continued to grow canine fur.\" \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m afraid of,\" Brandon said. \"It was only one in five. The odds are in your favor. It isn\u0027t likely that you\u0027ll stay a werewolf full-time.\" \"Isn\u0027t likely?\" Brandon asked, rising. \"One in five? What if I\u0027m the fifth one?\" \"What choice do we have?\" his father asked, rising, too. \"Do you want to remain in this condition forever? Eating like an animal during the day, talking to wolves, and then under a full moon turning into one? At least I am giving you a chance to be cured. It\u0027s better than what we are facing now.\" Brandon turned to me. He knew what he had to do - for himself and for Nash. \"You are my son,\" Dr. Maddox said in a comforting voice. \"I want you to be able to live a normal life.\" Brandon was tormented by his condition and by the decisions he had to make. He didn\u0027t want to argue with his father, but he also didn\u0027t want to feel compelled to take it knowing there were risks. I could sense that he was thinking about that one little mouse that didn\u0027t return to normal. \"What would you do?\" Brandon finally asked him. \"I\u0027d take the serum,\" his father said adamantly. \"As soon as the sun sets and the full moon rises.\" He hugged Brandon tightly. When he finally let go, Dr. Maddox said, \"I\u0027m so tired. I\u0027d better be off to catch some shut-eye. We\u0027ll talk more in the morning. I think I\u0027ll be able to convince you when I\u0027m rested. Good night, Brandon. Good night, Celeste.\" He picked up the plate of cookies and walked upstairs. The following day, I came back to meet Brandon at his house. His father had plans to run some experiments, and Brandon wanted me to be there with them. He said he thought maybe if I was there his father wouldn\u0027t \"go all medieval on him,\" as he put it. We only had two weeks until the full moon, and Brandon would be taking the antidote. Apollo, the husky, was shut inside the main house while we were in the backyard next to the garden. \"Can you call Apollo out here?\" his father asked. \"I could do that before.\" Brandon cupped his mouth and yelled, \"Apollo!\" The dog ran to the window and barked. Dr. Maddox wasn\u0027t pleased with his son\u0027s humor. \"I mean with your mind,\" he chided. \"I just want to test out what you\u0027ve told me about your abilities as a werewolf.\" \"Fine.\" Brandon headed inside and opened the door and let Apollo out. The dog scampered and raced through the garden and backyard, chasing a bird. \"Calm him down,\" his dad challenged. \"Without calling him.\" Brandon rolled his eyes, like any normal teen, but then relaxed. When the busy, playful dog caught sight of him, Brandon glared at his pet. Apollo immediately stopped running and walked over to Brandon. Once at Brandon\u0027s feet, he knelt down and then fully reclined. \"That was amazing,\" his father said. He looked thoughtful for a moment. \"And can you tell me what kind of animals are in the vicinity?\" Brandon sighed, then reluctantly gazed around. He listened for a minute and then took in a deep breath. \"A hawk is flying this way from due south. Three sparrows are in those two trees. A family of deer is searching for food alongside that hill.\" Brandon pointed to an area, but I couldn\u0027t see anything through the thick brush. Brandon\u0027s father took out his binoculars. He pointed them to the trees and then deep into the woods. \"Those are sparrows. And I can see those deer now, too.\" A moment later a hawk flew overhead. Even I was impressed with Brandon\u0027s senses. Finally, after Brandon\u0027s father had documented several of his son\u0027s unusual powers, it was time for the older Maddox to have dinner with his parents. \"Will you be staying for dinner?\" his father asked. \"I have to go home,\" I said. \"I have a major exam tomorrow, and I still need to study.\" \"Well, it was great seeing you,\" Dr. Maddox said. \"I\u0027ll be leaving tomorrow.\" \"So soon?\" \"I\u0027m stopping in New York, then it\u0027s back to Geneva. Next time, I hope to stay longer. Maybe for good.\" \"That would be wonderful,\" I said. \"But in the meantime, I\u0027m counting on you both to take care of things while I\u0027m away. You have to promise me, Brandon; that serum is for you.\" \"But what if it doesn\u0027t work?\" Brandon asked. \"Then we\u0027ll go to plan B and fix it then. But at least we\u0027ll know.\" \"I guess....\" \"I need you to be convinced. I know this must be hard for you. I\u0027m counting on you to help yourself this time.\" Brandon managed a smile. \"And I\u0027m looking to you, Celeste,\" Dr. Maddox continued. \"You will be my eyes and ears. I\u0027m hoping he will take that serum at the next full moon.\" \"I understand,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t sure what to do when the full moon hit - to insist that Brandon take the serum or not - but I knew it was ultimately his decision and I\u0027d be right by his side. \"I know this isn\u0027t ideal, me being half a world away from you,\" Dr. Maddox went on. \"You\u0027re in high school, with so many things happening to you. I\u0027m missing it. You are growing up without me.\" \"I\u0027m not,\" Brandon said. \"You are right here with me - I have your serum.\" I thought Brandon might have been convinced now to take the antidote and try it out - if not for himself, for his father and Nash.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-4.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
