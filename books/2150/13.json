Abby was getting ready for volleyball practice, and Ivy was using Abby\u0027s locker mirror to touch up her makeup.\n \"I have to ask you something, and I know you guys will think I\u0027m crazy,\" I said.\n A few of the other athletes shut their lockers and headed out.\n \"Sure,\" Abby said. \"But you\u0027ll have to make it quick.\"\n \"On Saturday night,\" I began in an ultra-happy tone, \"how about you guys come to my house for movies?\"\n \"That\u0027s the day of the Werewolf Fest,\" Abby said.\n \"Yes, can you make it another day?\" Ivy asked, puckering her lips in the mirror.\n \"No,\" I replied gently. \"It has to be that night.\"\n \"Well, we are going to the fest. Aren\u0027t you?\" Abby asked.\n \"I was going to. But I thought it might be fun to have a girls\u0027 night instead.\" I tried to be lighthearted about the matter.\n \"On the biggest night of the year besides prom?\" Abby said.\n \"The Werewolf Fest only happens every ten years.\" Ivy turned to me.\n Even though I\u0027d read in Ryder\u0027s journal that he was after me, I knew the other guys were also looking for girlfriends. I wanted to make sure my friends were not in harm\u0027s way, too. \"No way am I missing it,\" Abby insisted.\n \"You can\u0027t go,\" I said with a forceful whisper. \"It could be dangerous.\"\n \"Dangerous?\" Abby laughed. \"Get out.\"\n \"Those guys who have been bugging us are going to be there,\" I protested.\n \"So?\" Ivy asked. \"What\u0027s the big deal?\"\n \"What if they bother us again?\" I asked.\n \"Jake and Dylan will kick their - \"\n \"What if they can\u0027t?\" I interrupted. \"What if these guys are stronger?\"\n \"Than Jake, Dylan, Nash, and Brandon?\" Ivy said. \"I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"And me,\" Abby said. \"I can defend us, too.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to let them keep me home,\" Ivy said.\n \"I think they are after me, and maybe you, too,\" I whispered. \"And I think we\u0027ll be safer if we stay home that night.\"\n \"You are kidding,\" Ivy said.\n \"No, I\u0027m not. I got Ryder\u0027s journal.\"\n \"Where did you find that?\" Abby asked, interested.\n \"They were camping out over by the woods in my neighborhood,\" I said.\n \"Where you live?\" Abby wondered.\n \"Yes, that\u0027s what I was trying to tell you,\" I replied. \"Only Brandon convinced them to go to his house to camp out - so he could watch them.\"\n \"That was nice of him, but really,\" Ivy went on, \"they didn\u0027t do anything wrong.\"\n \"You saw them following us at the mall,\" I said. \"And then that time they snuck up on me when I was walking Champ? Now they show up camping near my house?\"\n \"Yes, but that was all,\" Ivy replied.\n \"Fortunately,\" I said, still pressing my point. \"But I think they are planning something for the festival.\"\n \"I\u0027m not saying we should marry them,\" Ivy said. \"I\u0027m just saying that I\u0027m not going to let them stop me from going to the best event in our town\u0027s history.\"\n I took a deep breath as Abby shut her locker and pulled up her volleyball socks. \"You just have to believe me,\" I pleaded. \"It\u0027s for our own good.\"\n \"I think you are just being overprotective.\" Ivy patted me on the back. \"Everyone will be there. Nothing will happen to any of us.\"\n \"It will be a full moon,\" I warned them.\n \"I know, that\u0027s the point,\" Ivy said. \"It will be so cool.\"\n \"It won\u0027t be cool. They aren\u0027t like us.\"\n \"Thank goodness. I wouldn\u0027t look good covered in tattoos.\" Ivy giggled.\n \"I think you would,\" Abby thought aloud. \"You could cover yourself in designer labels,\" she teased.\n \"I\u0027m serious,\" I said. \"They are really different. More different than you can imagine.\"\n \"What are you getting at?\" Ivy said. \"If you are asking us to miss the fest, there must be a good reason. So just come out and say it.\"\n I leaned in and spoke softly. \"Because they are werewolves,\" I said.\n My friends stared at me for a few seconds.\n \"What?\" Ivy asked.\n \"You are crazy!\" Abby said.\n \"I knew you\u0027d think so.\"\n They both laughed. \"Is that all? That they are werewolves?\" Ivy asked. \"I thought you were going to say convicts or something.\"\n \"Yes, or runaways from an asylum,\" Abby said.\n \"So you believe me?\" I wondered.\n Abby began to leave, and we followed.\n \"I believe you are afraid of werewolves, but I don\u0027t believe in them,\" Ivy said. \"There are tons of underground weirdos like that. I\u0027ve seen shows on TV about that.\"\n \"They think they are werewolves because they want to scare girls,\" Abby told us. \"It\u0027s the oldest trick in the book. Just like on Halloween, guys dress up as monsters. They are just getting in the spirit of the fest. Like Trekkies. Only these guys aren\u0027t nerds.\"\n \"They\u0027re wackos!\" Ivy added.\n They both laughed.\n I wasn\u0027t getting the response I wanted from my friends. I knew they wouldn\u0027t believe me, but I had to try. \"Let\u0027s just say they might be taking it too far.\"\n \"Like a certain someone who wears a Superman cape,\" Ivy said, \"but doesn\u0027t want to take it off?\"\n \"Something like that,\" I said.\n \"So they are going to howl at the moon?\" Ivy asked.\n \"They want to turn us into werewolves.\"\n They both laughed again.\n \"I\u0027ll already be one,\" Abby said. \"I\u0027m dressing up.\"\n \"Have I ever lied to you before?\" I finally asked them when we reached the gym.\n \"Uh...no,\" Ivy admitted.\n \"Not to me,\" Abby said. \"You didn\u0027t lie to us about dating Brandon. You just withheld the information. That\u0027s not a lie.\"\n \"Have I ever tried to get in the way of your fun?\" I asked.\n They paused and both shook their heads.\n \"You have to believe me. This once,\" I said. \"I never ask anything from you guys.\"\n \"But you are asking us to miss the best event in this town\u0027s history because of three pranksters,\" Ivy whined.\n The coach blew her whistle.\n \"I gotta run,\" Abby said.\n I grabbed her jersey. \"I\u0027m your best friend. I never ask anything of you guys. And once, I ask something of you both - for your own good - and you ignore me. Fine. I warned you, like Dr. Meadows warned me. But I didn\u0027t listen and so many things happened.\"\n \"Don\u0027t go all \u0027crazy girl\u0027 on us,\" Ivy said.\n \"Like when Dr. Meadows warned you and then those wolves stalked you in the snow?\" Abby asked.\n I nodded.\n \"All right,\" Abby relented as I let go. \"I\u0027ll come over.\"\n \"You will?\" I asked eagerly.\n She high-fived me and ran off to join her teammates.\n I was left standing with Ivy.\n \"I guess I\u0027ll come, too,\" she said resignedly.\n I put my arm around her shoulder. \"You are the greatest!\"\n \"Yes, but if we miss anyone else being bitten, then I\u0027m really going to be mad,\" Ivy teased.\n I was relieved. \"You won\u0027t regret this.\"\n \"You better have some amazing movies and piping-hot pizza for us,\" Ivy said.\n \"I promise.\"\n \"We are all set,\" I told Brandon when I saw him later that day at Willow Park. We decided to meet by the lake - so we could be alone and talk. \"Ivy and Abby have agreed to come to my house for a girls\u0027 night. They can\u0027t bother us if we are at home, right? We have a security system, and I\u0027ll keep all the lights on. If Ryder and his crew can\u0027t hide under the cloak of darkness and other costumed werewolves, then his plan is blown. Ivy and Abby can stay the night, and in the morning the full moon won\u0027t be an issue.\"\n \"You are a good friend to them,\" Brandon said.\n \"They think I\u0027m nuts.\" I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. \"Here they were the ones dragging me to Dr. Meadows, and now I\u0027m the one talking about sixth senses.\"\n \"I do have some good news,\" he said.\n \"Good news? Tell me.\"\n \"My dad called and said he\u0027s sent another vial of werewolf antidote. Nash will be able to take the one I already have. And I had a thought about the other vial.\"\n \"You\u0027ll take it the following night?\"\n \"No - Ryder will first. My dad said this batch is really potent. It will work by taking just one sip. \u0027There will be no excuses this time for you not to take it,\u0027 he said. But if we cure Ryder, then our problems will be just about over. And we\u0027ll have enough serum left for me.\"\n \"And Leopold and Hunter?\" I asked.\n \"Perhaps there will be enough for all of us...\" he said, hopeful.\n \"That\u0027s awesome. You\u0027ll tell Ryder about it?\"\n \"No, I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t let him know that I know about his condition.\"\n \"But I think he\u0027d be okay with it since you have a cure. I read his journal. He\u0027s not happy being a werewolf.\"\n \"And you think I am?\" he asked.\n \"I didn\u0027t say that,\" I said.\n \"I know. I\u0027m just on edge.\"\n I held him close. \"It\u0027s okay. So much is going on. The fest. Ryder. Nash. We never even get a chance to talk about what you are going through.\"\n We sat down on a nearby bench.\n \"We haven\u0027t had time for anything else,\" Brandon said. \"And now I\u0027m worried about the full moon - I can\u0027t imagine what Ryder will be like. And all I think about is making sure you are okay.\"\n \"I will be - we will be.\" I tried to reassure him, even though I wasn\u0027t sure myself.\n \"Saturday night is the fest,\" he said. \"Then, after that, hopefully they will leave and go back to Huntington.\"\n \"And everything will be back to normal,\" I said, hoping it was true.\n \"I\u0027ve honestly forgotten what normal is,\" Brandon said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-13.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) \n Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
