{"id":96645,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"The following day, I found a note laying on our front stoop.\n On the outside of the folded white paper was typed in black, bold letters, Celeste.\n I opened the note and read:\n Ryder and brood left town. Meet me at dusk at the foot of Morrow Bridge to celebrate.I texted Brandon:\n I\u0027m on my way.\n The Morrow Bridge was only a few miles from where I lived. My mom had the car, so I took my bike. I headed down my street and out of our community. I walked my bike across the two-lane street and then pushed it between a barrier and overgrown brush to the gravel pit. I raced around the gravel pit to the bike trail. Once on the bike trail, I pedaled north, noticing the Little River that ran alongside me. My surroundings were so beautiful, and I couldn\u0027t wait to meet Brandon. I finally raced over a rusty bridge and stopped at the foot of it. I didn\u0027t see my boyfriend anywhere.\n I waited for a few moments as the sun set and the full moon shone.\n Then I heard Sinatra singing, \"Fly Me to the Moon.\"\n I quickly picked it up.\n \"Where are you?\" Brandon asked.\n \"At the foot of the Morrow Bridge. Just like you asked.\"\n He paused. \"I didn\u0027t ask you to meet me there,\" he said.\n \"I don\u0027t understand. You put the note in my mailbox.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t leave you any note,\" Brandon said. \"I\u0027m waiting for you at my house.\"\n I froze. \"Then who am I meeting?\" I asked, my voice shaking.\n Ryder, in werewolf form, stepped out from behind a dilapidated shack a few yards away.\n \"I was hoping you\u0027d come,\" he said seductively.\n Ryder was hot - no doubt about it. His jagged black hair was fiercely untamed and fell over his defined shoulders. His arms were beefy, and his tattoos stretched out in monstrous forms. His earrings popped out from underneath his long locks like spikes.\n I stood, immobilized. I couldn\u0027t breathe. It was like the first time I was lost in the woods, looking into the gray eyes of a hungry pack of wolves. I didn\u0027t have Brandon, Nash, my friends, or even a festival crowd to hide behind or give me comfort. My pulse skyrocketed, and I knew I\u0027d have to run for my life.\n I turned to escape and head back on the bridge, but I stopped in my tracks. Leopold was waiting on the other side. He appeared menacing as well. His stance was bold and threatening.\n \"Please help me,\" I said into the phone. \"Ryder and his pack are here. I don\u0027t feel safe.\"\n \"I\u0027m on my way,\" Brandon said.\n I hung up and slid the phone into my pocket.\n I spun around and hopped on my bike. I began to head to the right of where Ryder was standing. But when I pedaled to what I thought was woods, I saw rushing water between the trees. I should have known. There was the river.\n I looked back at him.\n \"I need you, Celeste.\" His voice was smooth, but I sensed he was cold and calculating.\n \"No you don\u0027t,\" I reassured him.\n \"Yes I do. I don\u0027t want to be alone forever.\" His wolf fangs glistened as he spoke.\n \"Who says that will happen to you? Just because you don\u0027t have a girlfriend now...\"\n \"But I\u0027m not going to change - I mean, my condition...This is who I am. And what girl in their right mind would fall in love with a werewolf?\"\n I paused. He knew that I loved Brandon, and now he knew Brandon was a werewolf, too.\n \"That\u0027s why you are the perfect girl for me.\" He gazed at me with sorrowful eyes. I felt so much intensity coming from him. I felt dizzy.\n He pulled me in to him and before I knew it I was on the other end of his lips. He was magnetic and his fingers slid softly through my hair. For a moment, I felt as if I were kissing Brandon. But then I caught a glimpse of his black locks and was shocked back into reality. I realized that this wasn\u0027t my boyfriend, and I pushed myself away. I wiped off my lips and spat.\n \"Why did you do that?\" I asked, horrified.\n \"Because I\u0027ve been searching for you - \" He grinned a wolflike grin.\n \"Forget it. You\u0027ll have to find someone else.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s you. You are everything I\u0027m looking for. Beautiful, sweet, kind, feisty. Those are all the traits that I want in someone. And I need someone to be with. We all do. Someone like me - and you are that girl.\"\n It was nice to hear those compliments, even from someone as reckless as Ryder. But I wasn\u0027t about to get caught up in his seduction again. \"I\u0027m nothing like you. You\u0027re rude. Pathetic.\"\n \"Oh, Celeste, I was just acting. You think I\u0027m really rude? I\u0027m a gentleman.\"\n \"A gentleman wouldn\u0027t trick a girl into meeting him or into becoming a werewolf.\"\n \"I wanted to get to know you. Perhaps I went about it the wrong way. But we are here now, and the moonlight is so beautiful.\"\n \"There is nothing beautiful about tonight,\" I said.\n He snarled.\n \"I\u0027m sure there is a girl for you, Ryder. Someone who will love you. But you can\u0027t force someone the way you\u0027re trying with me.\"\n \"No one will love me the way that I am. I\u0027m a monster - don\u0027t you see? So are my friends. What chance do we have? I need someone like you.\" Ryder was as genuine as I\u0027d ever seen him. Yet I wasn\u0027t sure why he was interested in me.\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\n \"You are so compassionate and understanding. I need a girl like you. Someone who can take care of me - like I take care of her.\"\n \"You can\u0027t take care of anyone when you scare someone,\" I said. \"Just be yourself. But be a kinder self. You made enemies with Brandon, and you\u0027ve frightened me and my friends. If you want someone kind, then you have to show up and be kind, too.\"\n His friends crept over and surrounded us.\n Ryder came toward me again. He was dangerous and wild. His wolf fangs gleamed near me. There was no escape. I was inches away from being bitten.\n I held out my arm to block him. I knew I\u0027d kick him if I had to. But then I thought my words might be more of a deterrent.\n \"I know how to help you,\" I said. \"And this isn\u0027t the way.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you do,\" he said, not understanding me.\n \"I have a cure. That\u0027s what you really want, Ryder. Not to be with me - but to be yourself. Yourselves, all of you.\"\n \"What kind of cure?\" Leopold asked.\n Hunter\u0027s steely gray eyes brightened. \"You can get us a cure?\"\n \"She\u0027s lying!\" Ryder shouted, grabbing my arm and pulling me away from them.\n \"What if she isn\u0027t?\" Hunter asked.\n \"Yes,\" Leopold said.\n \"She has to be. If she had a cure, why wouldn\u0027t Brandon have taken it?\" he asked.\n \"Because he gave his dose to Nash,\" I said, \"so he could be cured. And it worked for Nash!\"\n \"Who is Nash?\" Hunter asked.\n \"That guy who won the werewolf contest last night at the fest. He used to be a werewolf.\"\n Ryder squeezed my arm tightly.\n \"You\u0027re hurting me!\" I shouted.\n \"Don\u0027t - \" Leopold said. \"She can help us!\"\n \"Yes, let her go!\" Hunter insisted.\n \"I don\u0027t care if you are a werewolf,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll defend myself if I have to.\"\n \"You can\u0027t touch me,\" Ryder growled.\n \"I can if I have a cure that you never get. I can make sure that you\u0027ll be like this forever.\" Ryder didn\u0027t budge.\n \"I\u0027ll give it to you, Leopold,\" I said. \"All you have to do is help free me.\"\n \"You better let her go, Ryder.\" Leopold stepped in close, flashing his fangs at his friend.\n \"Yes,\" Hunter added. \"I don\u0027t want to stay like this forever just so you can have a girlfriend.\"\n All at once a fierce howl came from within the woods behind us. A pack of wolves rushed out and headed straight for us. I covered my face out of fear, then realized they were barking at Ryder and his gang.\n Ryder let go of me and growled at the wolves, but they didn\u0027t retreat. He stared at them and flashed his fangs, but nothing he did worked to calm them down. They were ready to attack.\n I felt a rush of air pass by me, and all of sudden Brandon had pushed Ryder away from me and pulled me out of harm\u0027s way. I was so relieved to have Brandon here, I hugged him with all my might.\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked.\n I nodded, so grateful my heroic boyfriend was holding me.\n The wolves continued to growl at Ryder.\n \"Call them off,\" he said.\n Brandon got in Ryder\u0027s face. \"You are a menace as a werewolf and a human. There is no separation between monster and man except those fangs.\"\n Ryder seemed truly hurt by Brandon\u0027s comments. I guessed that was what Ryder feared - that he really was unlovable.\n \"But it\u0027s not the way you look now,\" Brandon went on. \"It\u0027s the way you act - always.\"\n Ryder\u0027s hurt morphed into anger. His gray eyes grew red with rage.\n \"You don\u0027t know anything about me - \" Ryder said.\n \"You know I do,\" Brandon challenged back.\n \"I beat you before, and I can do it again - \"\n \"Not this time,\" Brandon said.\n The wolves crept closer and snarled as if they were ready to kill.\n \"You need your dogs to do your dirty work,\" Ryder jabbed.\n \"And you need a hockey stick to fight dirty,\" he said, referring to the championship game when Ryder had attacked him. \"And now a gang of werewolves to get you a date. I\u0027m not worried.\"\n Brandon whistled, and the wolves retreated. He stepped closer to Ryder. \"Now what are you going to do?\"\n Ryder looked to his friends, but they didn\u0027t budge. Instead, they backed off and stepped away from us.\n \"She said something about a cure - \" Leopold said.\n \"Yes,\" Hunter said.\n \"Quit whining,\" Ryder said, \"and help me.\"\n \"But we want her to help us....\" Leopold said.\n \"Forget that, you jerks, jump them!\"\n But Ryder wasn\u0027t able to command his pack as easily as Brandon was his.\n \"It was something she said - \" Leopold appeared saddened that what I told him might not be true.\n \"We were hoping....\" Hunter added.\n \"It\u0027s true,\" Brandon said to them.\n They both perked up. \"Are you kidding? You have something to make us human again? All the time?\"\n He nodded.\n They stepped between Ryder and Brandon.\n \"Hey - \" Ryder said. \"What are you doing?\"\n \"Exactly what we should have done before,\" Leopold said. \"Finding a new pack leader.\"\n Hunter held Ryder at bay.\n \"I have to tell you, there\u0027s a chance the cure can backfire,\" Brandon said sincerely, \"and you could end up a werewolf full-time.\"\n \"It\u0027s a chance I have to take,\" Leopold said.\n \"Me, too!\" Hunter demanded.\n \"What do I do?\" Leopold asked hurriedly.\n The two eager werewolves hovered around Brandon as he grabbed the vial from out of his pocket.\n \"I only have one vial,\" Brandon said. \"But the dose is strong.\"\n \"We\u0027ll share?\" Leopold asked.\n Brandon nodded. Then he uncorked the vial and handed it to Leopold.\n I admired my boyfriend, who was so gracious to give his cure over to his enemies for the chance of making them well.\n Leopold took a sip and handed the vial back to Brandon.\n Nothing happened.\n \"I\u0027m going to be like this forever?\" Leopold asked nervously. He grew so upset he balled up his fists in frustration. I feared he was going to take off into the woods in despair.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I reassured him. \"It takes some time.\"\n \"Like how long?\" he asked worriedly. \"What will happen?\"\n \"You just have to be patient,\" I said.\n \"You are just fooling me - maybe what you gave me was poison!\"\n He began to lunge toward Brandon, but Brandon stepped back before Leopold made contact.\n \"Just relax,\" I said to Leopold. I went to him, and his gray eyes tensed in surprise that I\u0027d approached him. I took his hand. He suddenly mellowed. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"We are here with you. You aren\u0027t alone. It takes a few minutes to affect your body. But we won\u0027t leave your side.\"\n Leopold softened; I could feel his tense hand relax.\n Then the hairs on his chest began to disappear. One by one. And his beard became shorter and then was gone. His fangs receded and his steely gray eyes turned hazel.\n \"It worked!\" he said, laughing with relief. \"It worked!\"\n \"Let me have it,\" Hunter exclaimed. \"It\u0027s my turn.\"\n Brandon handed him the vial, and he took a sip.\n Hunter tried to remain calm. But he kept checking his chest and arms to see if any hair disappeared.\n \"It takes time,\" Leopold assured him.\n \"I know, I know.\" He breathed in deeply to calm himself. \"But it feels like a lifetime.\"\n \"This is all your fault,\" Leopold said to Ryder. \"If you hadn\u0027t asked us to sneak into that wolf sanctuary, none of this would have happened.\"\n \"Don\u0027t blame me - \" Ryder said. He was standing a few feet away from us, watching what was transpiring with his friends.\n \"I do blame you,\" Hunter said. \"If this doesn\u0027t work, you\u0027ll be the one who needs a sanctuary.\" Hunter snarled at his former friend as the hairs began to fall off his chest and arms and his biceps returned to their normal size. He flashed a toothy smile and high-fived Leopold.\n \"Thank you,\" Hunter said to Brandon as he handed back the vial. \"I owe my life to you, man.\" He shook Brandon\u0027s hand and hugged him, like they were players on the ice after a game. Leopold did the same as they were taken with delight in their sudden normalcy.\n There was only one sip left. I could see in Ryder\u0027s eyes how he craved to take it.\n But there was also Brandon, who had been waiting so long to be cured himself.\n I didn\u0027t know what would happen next. I turned to Brandon, hoping he\u0027d take it, but he didn\u0027t move. Instead, he stared empathetically at his last foe.\n Brandon extended the vial to Ryder.\n Ryder paused for a moment. He looked at Brandon, who was handing him an olive branch.\n \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027d give me your last dose,\" Ryder said. \"After all we\u0027ve been through - \"\n Brandon half smiled. \"Go on already.\"\n I, too, felt touched by the magnitude of the situation. Everyone was going to have a chance to be cured - everyone but Brandon. At this point, he was going to remain a werewolf.\n Ryder appeared relieved by the vial of serum and all that it could offer him. He examined it and looked around at all of us. He held it up to make a toast. \"Here\u0027s to normality.\" Then he took the last sip.\n Nothing happened.\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"You have to wait.\"\n But when two minutes turned into three, then four, then five, we all were saddened.\n \"It\u0027s all right - don\u0027t panic,\" Brandon said. \"I can call my dad. He can work on another serum.\"\n Ryder was so furious, he let out a ferocious howl. He hadn\u0027t been cured. He took off into the woods as we all stood still, saddened by his fate.\n \"I know he can be cured, too,\" Brandon said. \"If only he would wait.\"\n Hunter and Leopold walked over the bridge with us.\n \"You were right,\" Leopold said. \"That angry werewolf is who Ryder has always been, even by daylight. Now he just has longer hair.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/full-moon-kisses-full-moon-3/page-16.html","bookId":2150,"book":{"id":2150,"title":"Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Full Moon Kisses (Full Moon #3) \n Celeste and Brandon know that Nash in werewolf form is bad news.
