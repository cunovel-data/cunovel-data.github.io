{"id":548,"no":6,"title":"Chapter Six","content":"“Whew,” whistled the Case boy. “Gosh!” Then he scratched his head and looked admiringly at the youth. “What mought yer name be?” he asked. “I\u0027m The Oskaloosa Kid,” replied the youth, unable to resist the admiration of the other\u0027s fond gaze. “Look here!” and he fished a handful of jewelry from one of his side pockets; “this is some of the swag I stole last night when I robbed a house.” Case Jr. opened his mouth and eyes so wide that there was little left of his face. “But that\u0027s nothing,” bragged The Kid. “I shot a man, too.” “Last night?” whispered the boy. “Yep,” replied the bad man, tersely. “Gosh!” said the young Mr. Case, but there was that in his facial expression which brought to The Oskaloosa Kid a sudden regret that he had thus rashly confided in a stranger. “Say,” said The Kid, after a moment\u0027s strained silence. “Don\u0027t tell anyone, will you? If you\u0027ll promise I\u0027ll give you a dollar,” and he hunted through his roll of bills for one of that lowly denomination. “All right,” agreed the Case boy. “I won\u0027t say a word—where\u0027s the dollar?” The youth drew a bill from his roll and handed it to the other. “If you tell,” he whispered, and he bent close toward the other\u0027s ear and spoke in a menacing tone; “If you tell, I\u0027ll kill you!” “Gosh!” said Willie Case. At this moment Case pere and mere emerged from the kitchen loaded with provender. “Here\u0027s enough an\u0027 more\u0027n enough, I reckon,” said Jeb Case. “We got eggs, butter, bread, bacon, milk, an\u0027 a mite o\u0027 garden sass.” “But we ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to charge you nothin\u0027 fer the garden sass,” interjected Mrs. Case. “That\u0027s awfully nice of you,” replied The Kid. “How much do I owe you for the rest of it?” “Oh,” said Jeb Case, rubbing his chin, eyeing the big roll of bills and wondering just the limit he might raise to, “I reckon \u0027bout four dollars an\u0027 six bits.” The Oskaloosa Kid peeled a five dollar bill from his roll and proffered it to the farmer. “I\u0027m ever so much obliged,” he said, “and you needn\u0027t mind about any change. I thank you so much.” With which he took the several packages and pails and turned toward the road. “Yew gotta return them pails!” shouted Mrs. Case after him. “Oh, of course,” replied The Kid. “Gosh!” exclaimed Mr. Case, feelingly. “I wisht I\u0027d asked six bits more—I mought jest as well o\u0027 got it as not. Gosh, eh?” “Gosh!” murmured Willie Case, fervently. Back down the sticky road plodded The Oskaloosa Kid, his arms heavy and his heart light, for, was he not \u0027bringing home the bacon,\u0027 literally as well as figuratively. As he entered the Squibbs\u0027 gateway he saw the girl and Bridge standing upon the verandah waiting his coming, and as he approached them and they caught a nearer view of his great burden of provisions they hailed him with loud acclaim. “Some artist!” cried the man. “And to think that I doubted your ability to make a successful touch! Forgive me! You are the ne plus ultra, non est cumquidibus, in hoc signo vinces, only and original kind of hand-out compellers.” “How in the world did you do it?” asked the girl, rapturously. “Oh, it\u0027s easy when you know how,” replied The Oskaloosa Kid carelessly, as, with the help of the others, he carried the fruits of his expedition into the kitchen. Here Bridge busied himself about the stove, adding more wood to the fire and scrubbing a portion of the top plate as clean as he could get it with such crude means as he could discover about the place. The youth he sent to the nearby brook for water after selecting the least dirty of the several empty tin cans lying about the floor of the summer kitchen. He warned against the use of the water from the old well and while the boy was away cut a generous portion of the bacon into long, thin strips. Shortly after, the water coming to the boil, Bridge lowered three eggs into it, glanced at his watch, greased one of the new cleaned stove lids with a piece of bacon rind and laid out as many strips of bacon as the lid would accommodate. Instantly the room was filled with the delicious odor of frying bacon. “M-m-m-m!” gloated The Oskaloosa Kid. “I wish I had bo—asked for more. My! but I never smelled anything so good as that in all my life. Are you going to boil only three eggs? I could eat a dozen.” “The can\u0027ll only hold three at a time,” explained Bridge. “We\u0027ll have some more boiling while we are eating these.” He borrowed his knife from the girl, who was slicing and buttering bread with it, and turned the bacon swiftly and deftly with the point, then he glanced at his watch. “The three minutes are up,” he announced and, with a couple of small, flat sticks saved for the purpose from the kindling wood, withdrew the eggs one at a time from the can. “But we have no cups!” exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid, in sudden despair. Bridge laughed. “Knock an end off your egg and the shell will answer in place of a cup. Got a knife?” The Kid didn\u0027t. Bridge eyed him quizzically. “You must have done most of your burgling near home,” he commented. “I\u0027m not a burglar!” cried the youth indignantly. Somehow it was very different when this nice voiced man called him a burglar from bragging of the fact himself to such as The Sky Pilot\u0027s villainous company, or the awestruck, open-mouthed Willie Case whose very expression invited heroics. Bridge made no reply, but his eyes wandered to the right hand side pocket of the boy\u0027s coat. Instantly the latter glanced guiltily downward to flush redly at the sight of several inches of pearl necklace protruding accusingly therefrom. The girl, a silent witness of the occurrence, was brought suddenly and painfully to a realization of her present position and recollection of the happenings of the preceding night. For the time she had forgotten that she was alone in the company of a tramp and a burglar—how much worse either might be she could only guess. The breakfast, commenced so auspiciously, continued in gloomy silence. At least the girl and The Oskaloosa Kid were silent and gloom steeped. Bridge was thoughtful but far from morose. His spirits were unquenchable. “I am afraid,” he said, “that I shall have to replace James. His defection is unforgivable, and he has misplaced the finger-bowls.” The youth and the girl forced wan smiles; but neither spoke. Bridge drew a pouch of tobacco and some papers from an inside pocket. “\u0027I had the makings and I smoked “\u0027And wondered over different things, “\u0027Thinkin\u0027 as how this old world joked “\u0027In callin\u0027 only some men kings “\u0027While I sat there a-blowin\u0027 rings.\u0027” He paused to kindle a sliver of wood at the stove. “In these parlous times,” he spoke as though to himself, “one must economize. They are taking a quarter of an ounce out of each five cents worth of chewing, I am told; so doubtless each box must be five or six matches short of full count. Even these papers seem thinner than of yore and they will only sell one book to a customer at that. Indeed Sherman was right.” The youth and the girl remained occupied with their own thoughts, and after a moment\u0027s silence the vagabond resumed: “\u0027Me? I was king of anywhere, “\u0027Peggin\u0027 away at nothing, hard. “\u0027Havin\u0027 no pet, particular care; “\u0027Havin\u0027 no trouble, or no pard; “\u0027\"Just me,” filled up my callin\u0027 card.\u0027 “Say, do you know I\u0027ve learned to love this Knibbs person. I used to think of him as a poor attic prune grinding away in his New York sky parlor, writing his verse of the things he longed for but had never known; until, one day, I met a fellow between Victorville and Cajon pass who knew His Knibbs, and come to find out this Knibbs is a regular fellow. His attic covers all God\u0027s country that is out of doors and he knows the road from La Bajada hill to Barstow a darned sight better than he knows Broadway.” There was no answering sympathy awakened in either of his listeners—they remained mute. Bridge rose and stretched. He picked up his knife, wiped off the blade, closed it and slipped it into a trousers\u0027 pocket. Then he walked toward the door. At the threshold he paused and turned. “\u0027Good-bye girls! I\u0027m through,\u0027” he quoted and passed out into the sunlight. Instantly the two within were on their feet and following him. “Where are you going?” cried The Oskaloosa Kid. “You\u0027re not going to leave us, are you?” “Oh, please don\u0027t!” pleaded the girl. “I don\u0027t know,” said Bridge, solemnly, “whether I\u0027m safe in remaining in your society or not. This Oskaloosa Kid is a bad proposition; and as for you, young lady, I rather imagine that the town constable is looking for you right now.” The girl winced. “Please don\u0027t,” she begged. “I haven\u0027t done anything wicked, honestly! But I want to get away so that they can\u0027t question me. I was in the car when they killed him; but I had nothing to do with it. It is just because of my father that I don\u0027t want them to find me. It would break his heart.” As the three stood back of the Squibbs\u0027 summer kitchen Fate, in the guise of a rural free delivery carrier and a Ford, passed by the front gate. A mile beyond he stopped at the Case mail box where Jeb and his son Willie were, as usual, waiting his coming, for the rural free delivery man often carries more news than is contained in his mail sacks. “Mornin\u0027 Jeb,” he called, as he swerved his light car from the road and drew up in front of the Case gate. “Mornin\u0027, Jim!” returned Mr. Case. “Nice rain we had last night. What\u0027s the news?” “Plenty! Plenty!” exclaimed the carrier. “Lived here nigh onto forty year, man an\u0027 boy, an\u0027 never seen such work before in all my life.” “How\u0027s that?” questioned the farmer, scenting something interesting. “Ol\u0027 man Baggs\u0027s murdered last night,” announced the carrier, watching eagerly for the effect of his announcement. “Gosh!” gasped Willie Case. “Was he shot?” It was almost a scream. “I dunno,” replied Jim. “He\u0027s up to the horspital now, an\u0027 the doc says he haint one chance in a thousand.” “Gosh!” exclaimed Mr. Case. “But thet ain\u0027t all,” continued Jim. “Reggie Paynter was murdered last night, too; right on the pike south of town. They threw his corpse outen a ottymobile.” “By gol!” cried Jeb Case; “I hearn them devils go by last night \u0027bout midnight er after. \u0027T woke me up. They must o\u0027 ben goin\u0027 sixty mile an hour. Er say,” he stopped to scratch his head. “Mebby it was tramps. They must a ben a score on \u0027em round here yesterday and las\u0027 night an\u0027 agin this mornin\u0027. I never seed so dum many bums in my life.” “An\u0027 thet ain\u0027t all,” went on the carrier, ignoring the other\u0027s comments. “Oakdale\u0027s all tore up. Abbie Prim\u0027s disappeared and Jonas Prim\u0027s house was robbed jest about the same time Ol\u0027 man Baggs \u0027uz murdered, er most murdered—chances is he\u0027s dead by this time anyhow. Doc said he hadn\u0027t no chance.” “Gosh!” It was a pater-filius duet. “But thet ain\u0027t all,” gloated Jim. “Two of the persons in the car with Reggie Paynter were recognized, an\u0027 who do you think one of \u0027em was, eh? Why one of \u0027em was Abbie Prim an\u0027 tother was a slick crook from Toledo er Noo York that\u0027s called The Oskaloosie Kid. By gum, I\u0027ll bet they get \u0027em in no time. Why already Jonas Prim\u0027s got a regular dee-dectiff down from Chicago, an\u0027 the board o\u0027 select-men\u0027s offered a re-ward o\u0027 fifty dollars fer the arrest an\u0027 conviction of the perpetrators of these dastardly crimes!” “Gosh!” cried Willie Case. “I know—“; but then he paused. If he told all he knew he saw plainly that either the carrier or his father would profit by it and collect the reward. Fifty dollars!! Willie gasped. “Well,” said Jim, “I gotta be on my way. Here\u0027s the Tribune—there ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 more fer ye. So long! Giddap!” and he was gone. “I don\u0027 see why he don\u0027t carry a whip,” mused Jeb Case. “A-gidappin\u0027 to that there tin lizzie,” he muttered disgustedly, “jes\u0027 like it was as good as a hoss. But I mind the time, the fust day he got the dinged thing, he gets out an\u0027 tries to lead it by Lem Smith\u0027s threshin\u0027 machine.” Jeb Case preferred an audience worthy his mettle; but Willie was better than no one, yet when he turned to note the effect of his remarks on his son, Willie was no where to be seen. If Jeb had but known it his young hopeless was already in the loft of the hay barn deep in a small, red-covered book entitled: “HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE.” Bridge, who had had no intention of deserting his helpless companions, appeared at last to yield reluctantly to their pleas. That indefinable something about the youth which appealed strongly to the protective instinct in the man, also assured him that the other\u0027s mask of criminality was for the most part assumed even though the stories of the two yeggmen and the loot bulging pockets argued to the contrary. There was the chance, however, that the boy had really taken the first step upon the road toward a criminal career, and if such were the case Bridge felt morally obligated to protect his new found friend from arrest, secure in the reflection that his own precept and example would do more to lead him back into the path of rectitude than would any police magistrate or penal institute. For the girl he felt a deep pity. In the past he had had knowledge of more than one other small-town girl led into wrong doing through the deadly monotony and flagrant hypocrisy of her environment. Himself highly imaginative and keenly sensitive, he realized with what depth of horror the girl anticipated a return to her home and friends after the childish escapade which had culminated, even through no fault of hers, in criminal tragedy of the most sordid sort. As the three held a council of war at the rear of the deserted house they were startled by the loud squeaking of brake bands on the road in front. Bridge ran quickly into the kitchen and through to the front room where he saw three men alighting from a large touring car which had drawn up before the sagging gate. As the foremost man, big and broad shouldered, raised his eyes to the building Bridge smothered an exclamation of surprise and chagrin, nor did he linger to inspect the other members of the party; but turned and ran quickly back to his companions. “We\u0027ve got to beat it!” he whispered; “they\u0027ve brought Burton himself down here.” “Who\u0027s Burton?” demanded the youth. “He\u0027s the best operative west of New York City,” replied Bridge, as he moved rapidly toward an outhouse directly in rear of the main building. Once behind the small, dilapidated structure which had once probably housed farm implements, Bridge paused and looked about. “They\u0027ll search here,” he prophesied, and then; “Those woods look good to me.” The Squibbs\u0027 woods, growing rank in the damp ravine at the bottom of the little valley, ran to within a hundred feet of the out-building. Dense undergrowth choked the ground to a height of eight or ten feet around the boles of the close set trees. If they could gain the seclusion of that tangled jungle there was little likelihood of their being discovered, provided they were not seen as they passed across the open space between their hiding place and the wood. “We\u0027d better make a break for it,” advised Bridge, and a moment later the three moved cautiously toward the wood, keeping the out-house between themselves and the farm house. Almost in front of them as they neared the wood they saw a well defined path leading into the thicket. Single-file they entered, to be almost instantly hidden from view, not only from the house but from any other point more than a dozen paces away, for the path was winding, narrow and closely walled by the budding verdure of the new Spring. Birds sang or twittered about them, the mat of dead leaves oozed spongily beneath their feet, giving forth no sound as they passed, save a faint sucking noise as a foot was lifted from each watery seat. Bridge was in the lead, moving steadily forward that they might put as much distance as possible between themselves and the detective should the latter chance to explore the wood. They had advanced a few hundred yards when the path crossed through a small clearing the center of which was destitute of fallen leaves. Here the path was beaten into soft mud and as Bridge came to it he stopped and bent his gaze incredulously upon the ground. The girl and the youth, halting upon either side, followed the direction of his eyes with theirs. The girl gave a little, involuntary gasp, and the boy grasped Bridge\u0027s hand as though fearful of losing him. The man turned a quizzical glance at each of them and smiled, though a bit ruefully. “It beats me,” he said. “What can it be?” whispered the boy. “Oh, let\u0027s go back,” begged the girl. “And go along to father with Burton?” asked Bridge. The girl trembled and shook her head. “I would rather die,” she said, firmly. “Come, let\u0027s go on.” The cause of their perturbation was imprinted deeply in the mud of the pathway—the irregular outlines of an enormous, naked, human foot—a great, uncouth foot that bespoke a monster of another world. While, still more uncanny, in view of what they had heard in the farm house during the previous night, there lay, sometimes partially obliterated by the footprints of the THING, the impress of a small, bare foot—a woman\u0027s or a child\u0027s—and over both an irregular scoring that might have been wrought by a dragging chain! In the loft of his father\u0027s hay barn Willie Case delved deep into the small red-covered volume, HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE; but though he turned many pages and flitted to and fro from preface to conclusion he met only with disappointment. The pictures of noted bank burglars and confidence men aided him not one whit, for in none of them could he descry the slightest resemblance to the smooth faced youth of the early morning. In fact, so totally different were the types shown in the little book that Willie was forced to scratch his head and exclaim “Gosh!” many times in an effort to reconcile the appearance of the innocent boy to the hardened, criminal faces he found portrayed upon the printed pages. “But, by gol!” he exclaimed mentally, “he said he was The Oskaloosie Kid, \u0027n\u0027 that he shot a man last night; but what I\u0027d like to know is how I\u0027m goin\u0027 to shadder him from this here book. Here it says: \u0027If the criminal gets on a street car and then jumps off at the next corner the good detective will know that his man is aware that he is being shadowed, and will stay on the car and telephone his office at the first opportunity.\u0027 \u0027N\u0027ere it sez: \u0027If your man gets into a carriage don\u0027t run up an\u0027 jump on the back of it; but simply hire another carriage and follow.\u0027 How in hek kin I foller this book?” wailed Willie. “They ain\u0027t no street cars \u0027round here. I ain\u0027t never seen a street car, \u0027n\u0027as fer a carriage, I reckon he means bus, they\u0027s only one on \u0027em in Oakdale \u0027n\u0027if they waz forty I\u0027d like to know how in hek I\u0027d hire one when I ain\u0027t got no money. I reckon I threw away my four-bits on this book—it don\u0027t tell a feller nothin\u0027 \u0027bout false whiskers, wigs \u0027n\u0027 the like,” and he tossed the book disgustedly into a corner, rose and descended to the barnyard. Here he busied himself about some task that should have been attended to a week before, and which even now was not destined to be completed that day, since Willie had no more than set himself to it than his attention was distracted by the sudden appearance of a touring car being brought to a stop in front of the gate. Instantly Willie dropped his irksome labor and slouched lazily toward the machine, the occupants of which were descending and heading for the Case front door. Jeb Case met them before they reached the porch and Willie lolled against a pillar listening eagerly to all that was said. The most imposing figure among the strangers was the same whom Bridge had seen approaching the Squibbs\u0027 house a short time before. It was he who acted as spokesman for the newcomers. “As you may know,” he said, after introducing himself, “a number of crimes were committed in and around Oakdale last night. We are searching for clews to the perpetrators, some of whom must still be in the neighborhood. Have you seen any strange or suspicious characters around lately?” “I should say we hed,” exclaimed Jeb emphatically. “I seen the wo\u0027st lookin\u0027 gang o\u0027 bums come outen my hay barn this mornin\u0027 thet I ever seed in my life. They must o\u0027 ben upward of a dozen on \u0027em. They waz makin\u0027 fer the house when I steps in an\u0027 grabs my ol\u0027 shot gun. I hollered at \u0027em not to come a step nigher \u0027n\u0027 I guess they seed it wa\u0027n\u0027t safe monkeyin\u0027 with me; so they skidaddled.” “Which way did they go?” asked Burton. “Off down the road yonder; but I don\u0027t know which way they turned at the crossin\u0027s, er ef they kept straight on toward Millsville.” Burton asked a number of questions in an effort to fix the identity of some of the gang, warned Jeb to telephone him at Jonas Prim\u0027s if he saw anything further of the strangers, and then retraced his steps toward the car. Not once had Jeb mentioned the youth who had purchased supplies from him that morning, and the reason was that Jeb had not considered the young man of sufficient importance, having cataloged him mentally as an unusually early specimen of the summer camper with which he was more or less familiar. Willie, on the contrary, realized the importance of their morning customer, yet just how he was to cash in on his knowledge was not yet entirely clear. He was already convinced that HOW TO BE A DETECTIVE would help him not at all, and with the natural suspicion of ignorance he feared to divulge his knowledge to the city detective for fear that the latter would find the means to cheat him out of the princely reward offered by the Oakdale village board. He thought of going at once to the Squibbs\u0027 house and placing the desperate criminals under arrest; but as fear throttled the idea in its infancy he cast about for some other plan. Even as he stood there thinking the great detective and his companions were entering the automobile to drive away. In a moment they would be gone. Were they not, after all, the very men, the only men, in fact, to assist him in his dilemma? At least he could test them out. If necessary he would divide the reward with them! Running toward the road Willie shouted to the departing sleuth. The car, moving slowly forward in low, came again to rest. Willie leaped to the running board. “If I tell you where the murderer is,” he whispered hoarsely, “do I git the $50.00?” Detective Burton was too old a hand to ignore even the most seemingly impossible of aids. He laid a kindly hand on Willie\u0027s shoulder. “You bet you do,” he replied heartily, “and what\u0027s more I\u0027ll add another fifty to it. What do you know?” “I seen the murderer this mornin\u0027,” Willie was gasping with excitement and elation. Already the one hundred dollars was as good as his. One hundred dollars! Willie “Goshed!” mentally even as he told his tale. “He come to our house an\u0027 bought some vittles an\u0027 stuff. Paw didn\u0027t know who he wuz; but when Paw went inside he told me he was The Oskaloosie Kid \u0027n\u0027 thet he robbed a house last night and killed a man, \u0027n\u0027 he had a whole pocket full o\u0027 money, \u0027n\u0027 he said he\u0027d kill me ef I told.” Detective Burton could scarce restrain a smile as he listened to this wildly improbable tale, yet his professional instinct was too keen to permit him to cast aside as worthless the faintest evidence until he had proven it to be worthless. He stepped from the car again and motioning to Willie to follow him returned to the Case yard where Jeb was already coming toward the gate, having noted the interest which his son was arousing among the occupants of the car. Willie pulled at the detective\u0027s sleeve. “Don\u0027t tell Paw about the reward,” he begged; “he\u0027ll keep it all hisself.” Burton reassured the boy with a smile and a nod, and then as he neared Jeb he asked him if a young man had been at his place that morning asking for food. “Sure,” replied Jeb; “but he didn\u0027t \u0027mount to nothin\u0027. One o\u0027 these here summer camper pests. He paid fer all he got. Had a roll o\u0027 bills \u0027s big as ye fist. Little feller he were, not much older \u0027n\u0027 Willie.” “Did you know that he told your son that he was The Oskaloosa Kid and that he had robbed a house and killed a man last night?” “Huh?” exclaimed Jeb. Then he turned and cast one awful look at Willie—a look large with menace. “Honest, Paw,” pleaded the boy. “I was a-scairt to tell you, \u0027cause he said he\u0027d kill me ef I told.” Jeb scratched his head. “Yew know what you\u0027ll get ef you\u0027re lyin\u0027 to me,” he threatened. “I believe he\u0027s telling the truth,” said detective Burton. “Where is the man now?” he asked Willie. “Down to the Squibbs\u0027 place,” and Willie jerked a dirty thumb toward the east. “Not now,” said Burton; “we just came from there; but there has been someone there this morning, for there is still a fire in the kitchen range. Does anyone live there?” “I should say not,” said Willie emphatically; “the place is haunted.” “Thet\u0027s right,” interjected Jeb. “Thet\u0027s what they do say, an\u0027 this here Oskaloosie Kid said they heered things las\u0027 night an\u0027 seed a dead man on the floor, didn\u0027t he M\u0027randy?” M\u0027randy nodded her head. “But I don\u0027t take no stock in what Willie\u0027s ben tellin\u0027 ye,” she continued, “\u0027n\u0027 ef his paw don\u0027t lick him I will. I told him tell I\u0027m good an\u0027 tired o\u0027 talkin\u0027 thet one liar \u0027round a place wuz all I could stand,” and she cast a meaning glance at her husband. “Honest, Maw, I ain\u0027t a-lyin\u0027,” insisted Willie. “Wot do you suppose he give me this fer, if it wasn\u0027t to keep me from talkin\u0027,” and the boy drew a crumpled one dollar bill from his pocket. It was worth the dollar to escape a thrashing. “He give you thet?” asked his mother. Willie nodded assent. “\u0027N\u0027 thet ain\u0027t all he had neither,” he said. “Beside all them bills he showed me a whole pocket full o\u0027 jewlry, \u0027n\u0027 he had a string o\u0027 things thet I don\u0027t know jest what you call \u0027em; but they looked like they was made outen the inside o\u0027 clam shells only they was all round like marbles.” Detective Burton raised his eyebrows. “Miss Prim\u0027s pearl necklace,” he commented to the man at his side. The other nodded. “Don\u0027t punish your son, Mrs. Case,” he said to the woman. “I believe he has discovered a great deal that will help us in locating the man we want. Of course I am interested principally in finding Miss Prim—her father has engaged me for that purpose; but I think the arrest of the perpetrators of any of last night\u0027s crimes will put us well along on the trail of the missing young lady, as it is almost a foregone conclusion that there is a connection between her disappearance and some of the occurrences which have so excited Oakdale. I do not mean that she was a party to any criminal act; but it is more than possible that she was abducted by the same men who later committed the other crimes.” The Cases hung open-mouthed upon his words, while his companions wondered at the loquaciousness of this ordinarily close-mouthed man, who, as a matter of fact, was but attempting to win the confidence of the boy on the chance that even now he had not told all that he knew; but Willie had told all. Finding, after a few minutes further conversation, that he could glean no additional information the detective returned to his car and drove west toward Millsville on the assumption that the fugitives would seek escape by the railway running through that village. Only thus could he account for their turning off the main pike. The latter was now well guarded all the way to Payson; while the Millsville road was still open. No sooner had he departed than Willie Case disappeared, nor did he answer at noon to the repeated ringing of the big, farm dinner bell. Half way between the Case farm and Millsville detective Burton saw, far ahead along the road, two figures scale a fence and disappear behind the fringing blackberry bushes which grew in tangled profusion on either side. When they came abreast of the spot he ordered the driver to stop; but though he scanned the open field carefully he saw no sign of living thing. “There are two men hiding behind those bushes,” he said to his companions in a low whisper. “One of you walk ahead about fifty yards and the other go back the same distance and then climb the fence. When I see you getting over I\u0027ll climb it here. They can\u0027t get away from us.” To the driver he said: “You have a gun. If they make a break go after \u0027em. You can shoot if they don\u0027t stop when you tell \u0027em to.” The two men walked in opposite directions along the road, and when Burton saw them turn in and start to climb the fence he vaulted over the panel directly opposite the car. He had scarcely alighted upon the other side when his eyes fell upon the disreputable figures of two tramps stretched out upon their backs and snoring audibly. Burton grinned. “You two sure can go to sleep in a hurry,” he said. One of the men opened his eyes and sat up. When he saw who it was that stood over him he grinned sheepishly. “Can\u0027t a guy lie down fer a minute in de bushes widout bein\u0027 pinched?” he asked. The other man now sat up and viewed the newcomer, while from either side Burton\u0027s companions closed in on the three. “Wot\u0027s de noise?” inquired the second tramp, looking from one to another of the intruders. “We ain\u0027t done nothin\u0027.” “Of course not, Charlie,” Burton assured him gaily. “Who would ever suspect that you or The General would do anything; but somebody did something in Oakdale last night and I want to take you back there and have a nice, long talk with you. Put your hands up!” “We—.” “Put \u0027em up!” snapped Burton, and when the four grimy fists had been elevated he signalled to his companions to search the two men. Nothing more formidable than knives, dope, and a needle were found upon them. “Say,” drawled Dopey Charlie. “We knows wot we knows; but hones\u0027 to gawd we didn\u0027t have nothin\u0027 to do wid it. We knows the guy that pulled it off—we spent las\u0027 night wid him an\u0027 his pal an\u0027 a skoit. He creased me, here,” and Charlie unbuttoned his clothing and exposed to view the bloody scratch of The Oskaloosa Kid\u0027s bullet. “On de level, Burton, we wern\u0027t in on it. Dis guy was at dat Squibbs\u0027 place wen we pulls in dere outen de rain. He has a pocket full o\u0027 kale an\u0027 sparklers an\u0027 tings, and he goes fer to shoot me up wen I tries to get away.” “Who was he?” asked Burton. “He called hisself de Oskaloosa Kid,” replied Charlie. “A guy called Bridge was wid him. You know him?” “I\u0027ve heard of him; but he\u0027s straight,” replied Burton. “Who was the skirt?” “I dunno,” said Charlie; “but she was gassin\u0027 \u0027bout her pals croakin\u0027 a guy an\u0027 turnin\u0027 \u0027im outten a gas wagon, an\u0027 dis Oskaloosa Kid he croaks some old guy in Oakdale las\u0027 night. Mebby he ain\u0027t a bad \u0027un though!” “Where are they now?” asked Burton. “We got away from \u0027em at the Squibbs\u0027 place this mornin\u0027,” said Charlie. “Well,” said Burton, “you boes come along with me. If you ain\u0027t done nothing the worst you\u0027ll get\u0027ll be three squares and a place to sleep for a few days. I want you where I can lay my hands on you when I need a couple of witnesses,” and he herded them over the fence and into the machine. As he himself was about to step in he felt suddenly of his breast pocket. “What\u0027s the matter?” asked one of his companions. “I\u0027ve lost my note book,” replied Burton; “it must have dropped out of my pocket when I jumped the fence. Just wait a minute while I go look for it,” and he returned to the fence, vaulted it and disappeared behind the bushes. It was fully five minutes before he returned but when he did there was a look of satisfaction on his face. “Find it?” asked his principal lieutenant. “Yep,” replied Burton. “I wouldn\u0027t have lost it for anything.” Bridge and his companions had made their way along the wooded path for perhaps a quarter of a mile when the man halted and drew back behind the foliage of a flowering bush. With raised finger he motioned the others to silence and then pointed through the branches ahead. The boy and the girl, tense with excitement, peered past the man into a clearing in which stood a log shack, mud plastered; but it was not the hovel which held their mute attention—it was rather the figure of a girl, bare headed and bare footed, who toiled stubbornly with an old spade at a long, narrow excavation. All too suggestive in itself was the shape of the hole the girl was digging; there was no need of the silent proof of its purpose which lay beside her to tell the watchers that she worked alone in the midst of the forest solitude upon a human grave. The thing wrapped in an old quilt lay silently waiting for the making of its last bed. And as the three watched her other eyes watched them and the digging girl—wide, awestruck eyes, filled with a great terror, yet now and again half closing in the shrewd expression of cunning that is a hall mark of crafty ignorance. And as they watched, their over-wrought nerves suddenly shuddered to the grewsome clanking of a chain from the dark interior of the hovel. The youth, holding tight to Bridge\u0027s sleeve, strove to pull him away. “Let\u0027s go back,” he whispered in a voice that trembled so that he could scarce control it. “Yes, please,” urged the girl. “Here is another path leading toward the north. We must be close to a road. Let\u0027s get away from here.” The digger paused and raised her head, listening, as though she had caught the faint, whispered note of human voices. She was a black haired girl of nineteen or twenty, dressed in a motley of flowered calico and silk, with strings of gold and silver coins looped around her olive neck. Her bare arms were encircled by bracelets—some cheap and gaudy, others well wrought from gold and silver. From her ears depended ornaments fashioned from gold coins. Her whole appearance was barbaric, her occupation cast a sinister haze about her; and yet her eyes seemed fashioned for laughter and her lips for kissing. The watchers remained motionless as the girl peered first in one direction and then in another, seeking an explanation of the sounds which had disturbed her. Her brows were contracted into a scowl of apprehension which remained even after she returned to her labors, and that she was ill at ease was further evidenced by the frequent pauses she made to cast quick glances toward the dense tanglewood surrounding the clearing. At last the grave was dug. The girl climbed out and stood looking down upon the quilt wrapped thing at her feet. For a moment she stood there as silent and motionless as the dead. Only the twittering of birds disturbed the quiet of the wood. Bridge felt a soft hand slipped into his and slender fingers grip his own. He turned his eyes to see the boy at his side gazing with wide eyes and trembling lips at the tableau within the clearing. Involuntarily the man\u0027s hand closed tightly upon the youth\u0027s. And as they stood thus the silence was shattered by a loud and human sneeze from the thicket not fifty feet from where they stood. Instantly the girl in the clearing was electrified into action. Like a tigress charging those who stalked her she leaped swiftly across the clearing toward the point from which the disturbance had come. There was an answering commotion in the underbrush as the girl crashed through, a slender knife gleaming in her hand. Bridge and his companions heard the sounds of a swift and short pursuit followed by voices, one masterful, the other frightened and whimpering; and a moment afterward the girl reappeared dragging a boy with her—a wide-eyed, terrified, country boy who begged and blubbered to no avail. Beside the dead man the girl halted and then turned on her captive. In her right hand she still held the menacing blade. “What you do there watching me for?” she demanded. “Tell me the truth, or I kill you,” and she half raised the knife that he might profit in his decision by this most potent of arguments. The boy cowered. “I didn\u0027t come fer to watch you,” he whimpered. “I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for somebody else. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to be a dee-tectiff, an\u0027 I\u0027m shadderin\u0027 a murderer;” and he gasped and stammered: “But not you. I\u0027m lookin\u0027 for another murderer.” For the first time the watchers saw a faint smile touch the girl\u0027s lips. “What other murderer?” she asked. “Who has been murdered?” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928/80502.html","bookId":17,"book":{"id":17,"title":"The Oakdale Affair","description":"简介： The house on the hill showed lights only upon the first floorin the spacious reception hall, the dining room, and those more or less mysterious purlieus thereof from which emanate disagreeable odors and agreeable foods....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
