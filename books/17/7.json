{"id":549,"no":7,"title":"Chapter Seven","content":"“Two an\u0027 mebby three in Oakdale last night,” said Willie Case more glibly now that a chance for disseminating gossip momentarily outweighed his own fears. “Reginald Paynter was murdered an\u0027 ol\u0027 man Baggs an\u0027 Abigail Prim\u0027s missin\u0027. Like es not she\u0027s been murdered too, though they do say as she had a hand in it, bein\u0027 seen with Paynter an\u0027 The Oskaloosie Kid jest afore the murder.” As the boy\u0027s tale reached the ears of the three hidden in the underbrush Bridge glanced quickly at his companions. He saw the boy\u0027s horror-stricken expression follow the announcement of the name of the murdered Paynter, and he saw the girl flush crimson. Without urging, Willie Case proceeded with his story. He told of the coming of The Oskaloosa Kid to his father\u0027s farm that morning and of seeing some of the loot and hearing the confession of robbery and killing in Oakdale the night before. Bridge looked down at the youth beside him; but the other\u0027s face was averted and his eyes upon the ground. Then Willie told of the arrival of the great detective, of the reward that had been offered and of his decision to win it and become rich and famous in a single stroke. As he reached the end of his narrative he leaned close to the girl, whispering in her ear the while his furtive gaze wandered toward the spot where the three lay concealed. Bridge shrugged his shoulders as the palpable inference of that cunning glance was borne in upon him. The boy\u0027s voice had risen despite his efforts to hold it to a low whisper for what with the excitement of the adventure and his terror of the girl with the knife he had little or no control of himself, yet it was evident that he did not realize that practically every word he had spoken had reached the ears of the three in hiding and that his final precaution as he divulged the information to the girl was prompted by an excess of timidity and secretiveness. The eyes of the girl widened in surprise and fear as she learned that three watchers lay concealed at the verge of the clearing. She bent a long, searching look in the direction indicated by the boy and then turned her eyes quickly toward the hut as though to summon aid. At the same moment Bridge stepped from hiding into the clearing. His pleasant \u0027Good morning!\u0027 brought the girl around, facing him. “What you want?” she snapped. “I want you and this young man,” said Bridge, his voice now suddenly stern. “We have been watching you and followed you from the Squibbs house. We found the dead man there last night;” Bridge nodded toward the quilt enveloped thing upon the ground; “and we suspect that you had an accomplice.” Here he frowned meaningly upon Willie Case. The youth trembled and stammered. “I never seen her afore,” he cried. “I don\u0027 know nothin\u0027 about it. Honest I don\u0027t.” But the girl did not quail. “You get out,” she commanded. “You a bad man. Kill, steal. He know; he tell me. You get out or I call Beppo. He keel you. He eat you.” “Come, come, now, my dear,” urged Bridge, “be calm. Let us get at the root of this thing. Your young friend accuses me of being a murderer, does he? And he tells about murders in Oakdale that I have not even heard of. It seems to me that he must have some guilty knowledge himself of these affairs. Look at him and look at me. Notice his ears, his chin, his forehead, or rather the places where his chin and forehead should be, and then look once more at me. Which of us might be a murderer and which a detective? I ask you. “And as for yourself. I find you here in the depths of the wood digging a lonely grave for a human corpse. I ask myself: was this man murdered? but I do not say that he was murdered. I wait for an explanation from you, for you do not look a murderer, though I cannot say as much for your desperate companion.” The girl looked straight into Bridge\u0027s eyes for a full minute before she replied as though endeavoring to read his inmost soul. “I do not know this boy,” she said. “That is the truth. He was spying on me, and when I found him he told me that you and your companions were thieves and murderers and that you were hiding there watching me. You tell me the truth, all the truth, and I will tell you the truth. I have nothing to fear. If you do not tell me the truth I shall know it. Will you?” “I will,” replied Bridge, and then turning toward the brush he called: “Come here!” and presently a boy and a girl, dishevelled and fearful, crawled forth into sight. Willie Case\u0027s eyes went wide as they fell upon the Oskaloosa Kid. Quickly and simply Bridge told the girl the story of the past night, for he saw that by enlisting her sympathy he might find an avenue of escape for his companions, or at least a haven of refuge where they might hide until escape was possible. “And then,” he said in conclusion, “when the searchers arrived we followed the foot prints of yourself and the bear until we came upon you digging this grave.” Bridge\u0027s companions and Willie Case looked their surprise at his mention of a bear; but the gypsy girl only nodded her head as she had occasionally during his narrative. “I believe you,” said the girl. “It is not easy to deceive Giova. Now I tell you. This here,” she pointed toward the dead man, “he my father. He bad man. Steal; kill; drink; fight; but always good to Giova. Good to no one else but Beppo. He afraid Beppo. Even our people drive us out he, my father, so bad man. We wander \u0027round country mak leetle money when Beppo dance; mak lot money when HE steal. Two days he no come home. I go las\u0027 night look for him. Sometimes he too drunk come home he sleep Squeebs. I go there. I find heem dead. He have fits, six, seven year. He die fit. Beppo stay guard heem. I carry heem home. Giova strong, he no very large man. Beppo come too. I bury heem. No one know we leeve here. Pretty soon I go way with Beppo. Why tell people he dead. Who care? Mak lot trouble for Giova whose heart already ache plenty. No one love heem, only Beppo and Giova. No one love Giova, only Beppo; but some day Beppo he keel Giova now HE is dead, for Beppo vera large, strong bear—fierce bear—ogly bear. Even Giova who love Beppo is afraid Beppo. Beppo devil bear! Beppo got evil eye. “Well,” said Bridge, “I guess, Giova, that you and we are in the same boat. We haven\u0027t any of us done anything so very bad but it would be embarrassing to have to explain to the police what we have done,” here he glanced at The Oskaloosa Kid and the girl standing beside the youth. “Suppose we form a defensive alliance, eh? We\u0027ll help you and you help us. What do you say?” “All right,” acquiesced Giova; “but what we do with this?” and she jerked her thumb toward Willie Case. “If he don\u0027t behave we\u0027ll feed him to Beppo,” suggested Bridge. Willie shook in his boots, figuratively speaking, for in reality he shook upon his bare feet. “Lemme go,” he wailed, “an\u0027 I won\u0027t tell nobody nothin\u0027.” “No,” said Bridge, “you don\u0027t go until we\u0027re safely out of here. I wouldn\u0027t trust that vanishing chin of yours as far as I could throw Beppo by the tail.” “Wait!” exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid. “I have it!” “What have you?” asked Bridge. “Listen!” cried the boy excitedly. “This boy has been offered a hundred dollars for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the men who robbed and murdered in Oakdale last night. I\u0027ll give him a hundred dollars if he\u0027ll go away and say nothing about us.” “Look here, son,” said Bridge, “every time you open your mouth you put your foot in it. The less you advertise the fact that you have a hundred dollars the better off you\u0027ll be. I don\u0027t know how you come by so much wealth; but in view of several things which occurred last night I should not be crazy, were I you, to have to make a true income tax return. Somehow I have faith in you; but I doubt if any minion of the law would be similarly impressed.” The Oskaloosa Kid appeared hurt and crestfallen. Giova shot a suspicious glance at him. The other girl involuntarily drew away. Bridge noted the act and shook his head. “No,” he said, “we mustn\u0027t judge one another hastily, Miss Prim, and I take it you are Miss Prim?” The girl made a half gesture of denial, started to speak, hesitated and then resumed. “I would rather not say who I am, please,” she said. “Well,” said the man, “let\u0027s take one another at face value for a while, without digging too deep into the past; and now for our plans. This wood will be searched; but I don\u0027t see how we are to get out of it before dark as the roads are doubtless pretty well patrolled, or at least every farmer is on the lookout for suspicious strangers. So we might as well make the best of it here for the rest of the day. I think we\u0027re reasonably safe for the time being—if we keep Willie with us.” Willie had been an interested auditor of all that passed between his captors. He was obviously terrified; but his terror did not prevent him from absorbing all that he heard, nor from planning how he might utilize the information. He saw not only one reward but several and a glorious publicity which far transcended the most sanguine of his former dreams. He saw his picture not only in the Oakdale Tribune but in the newspapers of every city of the country. Assuming a stern and arrogant expression, or rather what he thought to be such, he posed, mentally, for the newspaper cameramen; and such is the power of association of ideas that he was presently strolling nonchalantly before a battery of motion picture machines. “Gee!” he murmured, “won\u0027t the other fellers be sore! I s\u0027ppose Pinkerton\u0027ll send for me \u0027bout the first thing \u0027n\u0027 offer me twenty fi\u0027 dollars a week, er mebbie more \u0027n thet. Gol durn, ef I don\u0027t hold out fer thirty! Gee!” Words, thoughts even, failed him. As the others planned they rather neglected Willie and when they came to assisting Giova in lowering her father into the grave and covering him over with earth they quite forgot Willie entirely. It was The Oskaloosa Kid who first thought of him. “Where\u0027s the boy?” he cried suddenly. The others looked quickly about the clearing, but no Willie was to be seen. Bridge shook his head ruefully. “We\u0027ll have to get out of this in a hurry now,” he said. “That little defective will have the whole neighborhood on us in an hour.” “Oh, what can we do?” cried the girl. “They mustn\u0027t find us! I should rather die than be found here with—” She stopped abruptly, flushed scarlet as the other three looked at her in silence, and then: “I am sorry,” she said. “I didn\u0027t know what I was saying. I am so frightened. You have all been good to me.” “I tell you what we do.” It was Giova speaking in the masterful voice of one who has perfect confidence in his own powers. “I know fine way out. This wood circle back south through swamp mile, mile an\u0027 a half. The road past Squeebs an\u0027 Case\u0027s go right through it. I know path there I fin\u0027 myself. We on\u0027y have to cross road, that only danger. Then we reach leetle stream south of woods, stream wind down through Payson. We all go Gypsies. I got lot clothing in house. We all go Gypsies, an\u0027 when we reach Payson we no try hide—jus\u0027 come out on street with Beppo. Mak\u0027 Beppo dance. No one think we try hide. Then come night we go \u0027way. Find more wood an\u0027 leetle lake other side Payson. I know place. We hide there long time. No one ever fin\u0027 us there. We tell two, three, four people in Payson we go Oakdale. They look Oakdale for us if they wan\u0027 fin\u0027 us. They no think look where we go. See?” “Oh, I can\u0027t go to Payson,” exclaimed the other girl. “Someone would be sure to recognize me.” “You come in house with me,” Giova assured her, “I feex you so your own mother no know you. You mens come too. I geeve you what to wear like Gypsy mens. We got lots things. My father, him he steal many things from our people after they drive us out. He go back by nights an\u0027 steal.” The three followed her toward the little hovel since there seemed no better plan than that which she had offered. Giova and the other girl were in the lead, followed by Bridge and the boy. The latter turned to the man and placed a hand upon his arm. “Why don\u0027t you leave us,” he asked. “You have done nothing. No one is looking for you. Why don\u0027t you go your way and save yourself from suspicion.” Bridge did not reply. “I believe,” the youth went on, “that you are doing it for me; but why I can\u0027t guess.” “Maybe I am,” Bridge half acknowledged. “You\u0027re a good little kid, but you need someone to look after you. It would be easier though if you\u0027d tell me the truth about yourself, which you certainly haven\u0027t up to now.” “Please don\u0027t ask me,” begged the boy. “I can\u0027t; honestly I can\u0027t.” “Is it as bad as that?” asked the man. “Oh, it\u0027s worse,” cried The Oskaloosa Kid. “It\u0027s a thousand times worse. Don\u0027t make me tell you, for if I do tell I shall have to leave you, and—and, oh, Bridge, I don\u0027t want to leave you—ever!” They had reached the door of the cabin now and were looking in past the girl who had halted there as Giova entered. Before them was a small room in which a large, vicious looking brown bear was chained. “Behold our ghost of last night!” exclaimed Bridge. “By George! though, I\u0027d as soon have hunted a real ghost in the dark as to have run into this fellow.” “Did you know last night that it was a bear?” asked the Kid. “You told Giova that you followed the footprints of herself and her bear; but you had not said anything about a bear to us.” “I had an idea last night,” explained Bridge, “that the sounds were produced by some animal dragging a chain; but I couldn\u0027t prove it and so I said nothing, and then this morning while we were following the trail I made up my mind that it was a bear. There were two facts which argued that such was the case. The first is that I don\u0027t believe in ghosts and that even if I did I would not expect a ghost to leave footprints in the mud, and the other is that I knew that the footprints of a bear are strangely similar to those of the naked feet of man. Then when I saw the Gypsy girl I was sure that what we had heard last night was nothing more nor less than a trained bear. The dress and appearance of the dead man lent themselves to a furtherance of my belief and the wisp of brown hair clutched in his fingers added still further proof.” Within the room the bear was now straining at his collar and growling ferociously at the strangers. Giova crossed the room, scolding him and at the same time attempting to assure him that the newcomers were friends; but the wicked expression upon the beast\u0027s face gave no indication that he would ever accept them as aught but enemies. It was a breathless Willie who broke into his mother\u0027s kitchen wide eyed and gasping from the effects of excitement and a long, hard run. “Fer lan\u0027 sakes!” exclaimed Mrs. Case. “Whatever in the world ails you?” “I got \u0027em; I got \u0027em!” cried Willie, dashing for the telephone. “Fer lan\u0027 sakes! I should think you did hev \u0027em,” retorted his mother as she trailed after him in the direction of the front hall. “\u0027N\u0027 whatever you got, you got \u0027em bad. Now you stop right where you air \u0027n\u0027 tell me whatever you got. \u0027Taint likely it\u0027s measles, fer you\u0027ve hed them three times, \u0027n\u0027 whoopin\u0027 cough ain\u0027t \u0027them,\u0027 it\u0027s \u0027it,\u0027 \u0027n\u0027—.” Mrs. Case paused and gasped—horrified. “Fer lan\u0027 sakes, Willie Case, you come right out o\u0027 this house this minute ef you got anything in your head.” She made a grab for Willie\u0027s arm; but the boy dodged and reached the telephone. “Shucks!” he cried. “I ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 in my head,” nor did either sense the unconscious humor of the statement. “What I got is a gang o\u0027 thieves an\u0027 murderers, an\u0027 I\u0027m callin\u0027 up thet big city deetectiff to come arter \u0027em.” Mrs. Case sank into a chair, prostrated by the weight of her emotions, while Willie took down the receiver after ringing the bell to attract central. Finally he obtained his connection, which was with Jonas Prim\u0027s bank where detective Burton was making his headquarters. Here he learned that Burton had not returned; but finally gave his message reluctantly to Jonas Prim after exacting a promise from that gentleman that he would be personally responsible for the payment of the reward. What Willie Case told Jonas Prim had the latter in a machine, with half a dozen deputy sheriffs and speeding southward from Oakdale inside of ten minutes. A short distance out from town they met detective Burton with his two prisoners. After a hurried consultation Dopey Charlie and The General were unloaded and started on the remainder of their journey afoot under guard of two of the deputies, while Burton\u0027s companions turned and followed the other car, Burton taking a seat beside Prim. “He said that he could take us right to where Abigail is,” Mr. Prim was explaining to Burton, “and that this Oskaloosa Kid is with her, and another man and a foreign looking girl. He told a wild story about seeing them burying a dead man in the woods back of Squibbs\u0027 place. I don\u0027t know how much to believe, or whether to believe any of it; but we can\u0027t afford not to run down every clew. I can\u0027t believe that my daughter is wilfully consorting with such men. She always has been full of life and spirit; but she\u0027s got a clean mind, and her little escapades have always been entirely harmless—at worst some sort of boyish prank. I simply won\u0027t believe it until I see it with my own eyes. If she\u0027s with them she\u0027s being held by force.” Burton made no reply. He was not a man to jump to conclusions. His success was largely due to the fact that he assumed nothing; but merely ran down each clew quickly yet painstakingly until he had a foundation of fact upon which to operate. His theory was that the simplest way is always the best way and so he never befogged the main issue with any elaborate system of deductive reasoning based on guesswork. Burton never guessed. He assumed that it was his business to KNOW, nor was he on any case long before he did know. He was employed now to find Abigail Prim. Each of the several crimes committed the previous night might or might not prove a clew to her whereabouts; but each must be run down in the process of elimination before Burton could feel safe in abandoning it. Already he had solved one of them to his satisfaction; and Dopey Charlie and The General were, all unknown to themselves, on the way to the gallows for the murder of Old John Baggs. When Burton had found them simulating sleep behind the bushes beside the road his observant eyes had noticed something that resembled a hurried cache. The excuse of a lost note book had taken him back to investigate and to find the loot of the Baggs\u0027s crime wrapped in a bloody rag and hastily buried in a shallow hole. When Burton and Jonas Prim arrived at the Case farm they were met by a new Willie. A puffed and important young man swaggered before them as he retold his tale and led them through the woods toward the spot where they were to bag their prey. The last hundred yards was made on hands and knees; but when the party arrived at the clearing there was no one in sight, only the hovel stood mute and hollow-eyed before them. “They must be inside,” whispered Willie to the detective. Burton passed a whispered word to his followers. Stealthily they crept through the underbrush until the cabin was surrounded; then, at a signal from their leader they rose and advanced upon the structure. No evidence of life indicated their presence had been noted, and Burton came to the very door of the cabin unchallenged. The others saw him pause an instant upon the threshold and then pass in. They closed behind him. Three minutes later he emerged, shaking his head. “There is no one here,” he announced. Willie Case was crestfallen. “But they must be,” he pleaded. “They must be. I saw \u0027em here just a leetle while back.” Burton turned and eyed the boy sternly. Willie quailed. “I seen \u0027em,” he cried. “Hones\u0027 I seen \u0027em. They was here just a few minutes ago. Here\u0027s where they burrit the dead man,” and he pointed to the little mound of earth near the center of the clearing. “We\u0027ll see,” commented Burton, tersely, and he sent two of his men back to the Case farm for spades. When they returned a few minutes\u0027 labor revealed that so much of Willie\u0027s story was true, for a quilt wrapped corpse was presently unearthed and lying upon the ground beside its violated grave. Willie\u0027s stock rose once more to par. In an improvised litter they carried the dead man back to Case\u0027s farm where they left him after notifying the coroner by telephone. Half of Burton\u0027s men were sent to the north side of the woods and half to the road upon the south of the Squibbs\u0027 farm. There they separated and formed a thin line of outposts about the entire area north of the road. If the quarry was within it could not escape without being seen. In the mean time Burton telephoned to Oakdale for reinforcements, as it would require fifty men at least to properly beat the tangled underbrush of the wood. In a clump of willows beside the little stream which winds through the town of Payson a party of four halted on the outskirts of the town. There were two men, two young women and a huge brown bear. The men and women were, obviously, Gypsies. Their clothing, their head-dress, their barbaric ornamentation proclaimed the fact to whoever might pass; but no one passed. “I think,” said Bridge, “that we will just stay where we are until after dark. We haven\u0027t passed or seen a human being since we left the cabin. No one can know that we are here and if we stay here until late to-night we should be able to pass around Payson unseen and reach the wood to the south of town. If we do meet anyone to-night we\u0027ll stop them and inquire the way to Oakdale—that\u0027ll throw them off the track.” The others acquiesced in his suggestion; but there were queries about food to be answered. It seemed that all were hungry and that the bear was ravenous. “What does he eat?” Bridge asked of Giova. “Mos\u0027 anything,” replied the girl. “He like garbage fine. Often I take him into towns late, ver\u0027 late at night an\u0027 he eat swill. I do that to-night. Beppo, he got to be fed or he eat Giova. I go feed Beppo, you go get food for us; then we all meet at edge of wood just other side town near old mill.” During the remainder of the afternoon and well after dark the party remained hidden in the willows. Then Giova started out with Beppo in search of garbage cans, Bridge bent his steps toward a small store upon the outskirts of town where food could be purchased, The Oskaloosa Kid having donated a ten dollar bill for the stocking of the commissariat, and the youth and the girl made their way around the south end of the town toward the meeting place beside the old mill. As Bridge moved through the quiet road at the outskirts of the little town he let his mind revert to the events of the past twenty four hours and as he pondered each happening since he met the youth in the dark of the storm the preceding night he asked himself why he had cast his lot with these strangers. In his years of vagabondage Bridge had never crossed that invisible line which separates honest men from thieves and murderers and which, once crossed, may never be recrossed. Chance and necessity had thrown him often among such men and women; but never had he been of them. The police of more than one city knew Bridge—they knew him, though, as a character and not as a criminal. A dozen times he had been arraigned upon suspicion; but as many times had he been released with a clean bill of morals until of late Bridge had become almost immune from arrest. The police who knew him knew that he was straight and they knew, too, that he would give no information against another man. For this they admired him as did the majority of the criminals with whom he had come in contact during his rovings. The present crisis, however, appeared most unpromising to Bridge. Grave crimes had been committed in Oakdale, and here was Bridge conniving in the escape of at least two people who might readily be under police suspicion. It was difficult for the man to bring himself to believe that either the youth or the girl was in any way actually responsible for either of the murders; yet it appeared that the latter had been present when a murder was committed and now by attempting to elude the police had become an accessory after the fact, since she possessed knowledge of the identity of the actual murderer; while the boy, by his own admission, had committed a burglary. Bridge shook his head wearily. Was he not himself an accessory after the fact in the matter of two crimes at least? These new friends, it seemed, were about to topple him into the abyss which he had studiously avoided for so long a time. But why should he permit it? What were they to him? A freight train was puffing into the siding at the Payson station. Bridge could hear the complaining brakes a mile away. It would be easy to leave the town and his dangerous companions far behind him; but even as the thought forced its way into his mind another obtruded itself to shoulder aside the first. It was recollection of the boy\u0027s words: “Oh, Bridge, I don\u0027t want to leave you—ever.” “I couldn\u0027t do it,” mused Bridge. “I don\u0027t know just why; but I couldn\u0027t. That kid has certainly got me. The first thing someone knows I\u0027ll be starting a foundlings\u0027 home. There is no question but that I am the soft mark, and I wonder why it is—why a kid I never saw before last night has a strangle hold on my heart that I can\u0027t shake loose—and don\u0027t want to. Now if it was a girl I could understand it.” Bridge stopped suddenly in the middle of the road. From his attitude he might have been startled either by a surprising noise or by a surprising thought. For a minute he stood motionless; then he shook his head again and proceeded along his way toward the little store; evidently if he had heard anything he was assured that it constituted no menace. As he entered the store to make his purchases a foxeyed man saw him and stepped quickly behind the huge stove which had not as yet been taken down for the summer. Bridge made his purchases, the volume of which required a large gunny-sack for transportation, and while he was thus occupied the fox-eyed man clung to his coign of vantage, himself unnoticed by the purchaser. When Bridge departed the other followed him, keeping in the shadow of the trees which bordered the street. Around the edge of town and down a road which led southward the two went until Bridge passed through a broken fence and halted beside an abandoned mill. The watcher saw his quarry set down his burden, seat himself beside it and proceed to roll a cigaret; then he faded away in the darkness and Bridge was alone. Five or ten minutes later two slender figures appeared dimly out of the north. They approached timidly, stopping often and looking first this way and then that and always listening. When they arrived opposite the mill Bridge saw them and gave a low whistle. Immediately the two passed through the fence and approached him. “My!” exclaimed one. “I thought we never would get here; but we didn\u0027t see a soul on the road. Where is Giova?” “She hasn\u0027t come yet,” replied Bridge, “and she may not. I don\u0027t see how a girl can browse around a town like this with a big bear at night and not be seen, and if she is seen she\u0027ll be followed—it would be too much of a treat for the rubes ever to be passed up—and if she\u0027s followed she won\u0027t come here. At least I hope she won\u0027t.” “What\u0027s that?” exclaimed The Oskaloosa Kid. Each stood in silence, listening. The girl shuddered. “Even now that I know what it is it makes me creep,” she whispered, as the faint clanking of a distant chain came to their ears. “We ought to be used to it by this time, Miss Prim,” said Bridge. “We heard it all last night and a good part of to-day.” The girl made no comment upon the use of the name which he had applied to her, and in the darkness he could not see her features, nor did he see the odd expression upon the boy\u0027s face as he heard the name addressed to her. Was he thinking of the nocturnal raid he so recently had made upon the boudoir of Miss Abigail Prim? Was he pondering the fact that his pockets bulged to the stolen belongings of that young lady? But whatever was passing in his mind he permitted none of it to pass his lips. As the three stood waiting in silence Giova came presently among them, the beast Beppo lumbering awkwardly at her side. “Did he find anything to eat?” asked the man. “Oh, yes,” exclaimed Giova. “He fill up now. That mak him better nature. Beppo not so ugly now.” “Well, I\u0027m glad of that,” said Bridge. “I haven\u0027t been looking forward much to his company through the woods to-night—especially while he was hungry!” Giova laughed a low, musical little laugh. “I don\u0027 think he no hurt you anyway,” she said. “Now he know you my frien\u0027.” “I hope you are quite correct in your surmise,” replied Bridge. “But even so I\u0027m not taking any chances.” Willie Case had been taken to Payson to testify before the coroner\u0027s jury investigating the death of Giova\u0027s father, and with the dollar which The Oskaloosa Kid had given him in the morning burning in his pocket had proceeded to indulge in an orgy of dissipation the moment that he had been freed from the inquest. Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction as he sat alone and by night for the first time in a public eating place. Willie was now a man of the world, a bon vivant, as he ordered ham and eggs from the pretty waitress of The Elite Restaurant on Broadway; but at heart he was not happy for never before had he realized what a great proportion of his anatomy was made up of hands and feet. As he glanced fearfully at the former, silhouetted against the white of the table cloth, he flushed scarlet, assured as he was that the waitress who had just turned away toward the kitchen with his order was convulsed with laughter and that every other eye in the establishment was glued upon him. To assume an air of nonchalance and thereby impress and disarm his critics Willie reached for a toothpick in the little glass holder near the center of the table and upset the sugar bowl. Immediately Willie snatched back the offending hand and glared ferociously at the ceiling. He could feel the roots of his hair being consumed in the heat of his skin. A quick side glance that required all his will power to consummate showed him that no one appeared to have noticed his faux pas and Willie was again slowly returning to normal when the proprietor of the restaurant came up from behind and asked him to remove his hat. Never had Willie Case spent so frightful a half hour as that within the brilliant interior of The Elite Restaurant. Twenty-three minutes of this eternity was consumed in waiting for his order to be served and seven minutes in disposing of the meal and paying his check. Willie\u0027s method of eating was in itself a sermon on efficiency—there was no lost motion—no waste of time. He placed his mouth within two inches of his plate after cutting his ham and eggs into pieces of a size that would permit each mouthful to enter without wedging; then he mixed his mashed potatoes in with the result and working his knife and fork alternately with bewildering rapidity shot a continuous stream of food into his gaping maw. In addition to the meat and potatoes there was one vegetable in a side-dish and as dessert four prunes. The meat course gone Willie placed the vegetable dish on the empty plate, seized a spoon in lieu of knife and fork and—presto! the side-dish was empty. Whereupon the prune dish was set in the empty side-dish—four deft motions and there were no prunes—in the dish. The entire feat had been accomplished in 6:34 1/2, setting a new world\u0027s record for red-headed farmer boys with one splay foot. In the remaining twenty five and one half seconds Willie walked what seemed to him a mile from his seat to the cashier\u0027s desk and at the last instant bumped into a waitress with a trayful of dishes. Clutched tightly in Willie\u0027s hand was thirty five cents and his check with a like amount written upon it. Amid the crash of crockery which followed the collision Willie slammed check and money upon the cashier\u0027s desk and fled. Nor did he pause until in the reassuring seclusion of a dark side street. There Willie sank upon the curb alternately cold with fear and hot with shame, weak and panting, and into his heart entered the iron of class hatred, searing it to the core. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928/80503.html","bookId":17,"book":{"id":17,"title":"The Oakdale Affair","description":"简介： The house on the hill showed lights only upon the first floorin the spacious reception hall, the dining room, and those more or less mysterious purlieus thereof from which emanate disagreeable odors and agreeable foods....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
