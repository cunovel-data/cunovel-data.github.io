{"id":547,"no":5,"title":"Chapter Five","content":"The girl, the boy, and Bridge waited as patiently as they could for the coming of the dawn, talking of the events of the night and planning against the future. Bridge advised the girl to return at once to her father; but this she resolutely refused to do, admitting with utmost candor that she lacked the courage to face her friends even though her father might still believe in her. The youth begged that he might accompany Bridge upon the road, pleading that his mother was dead and that he could not return home after his escapade. And Bridge could not find it in his heart to refuse him, for the man realized that the boyish waif possessed a subtile attraction, as forceful as it was inexplicable. Not since he had followed the open road in company with Billy Byrne had Bridge met one with whom he might care to \u0027Pal\u0027 before The Kid crossed his path on the dark and storm swept pike south of Oakdale. In Byrne, mucker, pugilist, and MAN, Bridge had found a physical and moral counterpart of himself, for the slender Bridge was muscled as a Greek god, while the stocky Byrne, metamorphosed by the fire of a woman\u0027s love, possessed all the chivalry of the care free tramp whose vagabondage had never succeeded in submerging the evidences of his cultural birthright. In the youth Bridge found an intellectual equal with the added charm of a physical dependent. The man did not attempt to fathom the evident appeal of the other\u0027s tacitly acknowledged cowardice; he merely knew that he would not have had the youth otherwise if he could have changed him. Ordinarily he accepted male cowardice with the resignation of surfeited disgust; but in the case of The Oskaloosa Kid he realized a certain artless charm which but tended to strengthen his liking for the youth, so brazen and unaffected was the boy\u0027s admission of his terror of both the real and the unreal menaces of this night of horror. That the girl also was well bred was quite evident to Bridge, while both the girl and the youth realized the refinement of the strange companion and protector which Fate had ordered for them, while they also saw in one another social counterparts of themselves. Thus, as the night dragged its slow course, the three came to trust each other more entirely and to speculate upon the strange train of circumstances which had brought them thus remarkably together—the thief, the murderer\u0027s accomplice, and the vagabond. It was during a period of thoughtful silence when the night was darkest just before the dawn and the rain had settled to a dismal drizzle unrelieved by lightning or by thunder that the five occupants of the room were suddenly startled by a strange pattering sound from the floor below. It was as the questioning fall of a child\u0027s feet upon the uncarpeted boards in the room beneath them. Frozen to silent rigidity, the five sat straining every faculty to catch the minutest sound from the black void where the dead man lay, and as they listened there came up to them, mingled with the inexplicable footsteps, the hollow reverberation from the dank cellar—the hideous dragging of the chain behind the nameless horror which had haunted them through the interminable eons of the ghastly night. Up, up, up it came toward the first floor. The pattering of the feet ceased. The clanking rose until the five heard the scraping of the chain against the door frame at the head of the cellar stairs. They heard it pass across the floor toward the center of the room and then, loud and piercing, there rang out against the silence of the awful night a woman\u0027s shriek. Instantly Bridge leaped to his feet. Without a word he tore the bed from before the door. “What are you doing?” cried the girl in a muffled scream. “I am going down to that woman,” said Bridge, and he drew the bolt, rusty and complaining, from its corroded seat. “No!” screamed the girl, and seconding her the youth sprang to his feet and threw his arms about Bridge. “Please! Please!” he cried. “Oh, please don\u0027t leave me.” The girl also ran to the man\u0027s side and clutched him by the sleeve. “Don\u0027t go!” she begged. “Oh, for God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t leave us here alone!” “You heard a woman scream, didn\u0027t you?” asked Bridge. “Do you suppose I can stay in up here when a woman may be facing death a few feet below me?” For answer the girl but held more tightly to his arm while the youth slipped to the floor and embraced the man\u0027s knees in a vice-like hold which he could not break without hurting his detainer. “Come! Come!” expostulated Bridge. “Let me go.” “Wait!” begged the girl. “Wait until you know that it is a human voice that screams through this horrible place.” The youth only strained his hold tighter about the man\u0027s legs. Bridge felt a soft cheek pressed to his knee; and, for some unaccountable reason, the appeal was stronger than the pleading of the girl. Slowly Bridge realized that he could not leave this defenseless youth alone even though a dozen women might be menaced by the uncanny death below. With a firm hand he shot the bolt. “Leave go of me,” he said; “I shan\u0027t leave you unless she calls for help in articulate words.” The boy rose and, trembling, pressed close to the man who, involuntarily, threw a protecting arm about the slim figure. The girl, too, drew nearer, while the two yeggmen rose and stood in rigid silence by the window. From below came an occasional rattle of the chain, followed after a few minutes by the now familiar clanking as the iron links scraped across the flooring. Mingled with the sound of the chain there rose to them what might have been the slow and ponderous footsteps of a heavy man, dragging painfully across the floor. For a few moments they heard it, and then all was silent. For a dozen tense minutes the five listened; but there was no repetition of any sound from below. Suddenly the girl breathed a deep sigh, and the spell of terror was broken. Bridge felt rather than heard the youth sobbing softly against his breast, while across the room The General gave a quick, nervous laugh which he as immediately suppressed as though fearful unnecessarily of calling attention to their presence. The other vagabond fumbled with his hypodermic needle and the narcotic which would quickly give his fluttering nerves the quiet they craved. Bridge, the boy, and the girl shivered together in their soggy clothing upon the edge of the bed, feeling now in the cold dawn the chill discomfort of which the excitement of the earlier hours of the night had rendered them unconscious. The youth coughed. “You\u0027ve caught cold,” said Bridge, his tone almost self-reproachful, as though he were entirely responsible for the boy\u0027s condition. “We\u0027re a nice aggregation of mollycoddles—five of us sitting half frozen up here with a stove on the floor below, and just because we heard a noise which we couldn\u0027t explain and hadn\u0027t the nerve to investigate.” He rose. “I\u0027m going down, rustle some wood and build a fire in that stove—you two kids have got to dry those clothes of yours and get warmed up or we\u0027ll have a couple of hospital cases on our hands.” Once again rose a chorus of pleas and objections. Oh, wouldn\u0027t he wait until daylight? See! the dawn was even then commencing to break. They didn\u0027t dare go down and they begged him not to leave them up there alone. At this Dopey Charlie spoke up. The \u0027hop\u0027 had commenced to assert its dominion over his shattered nervous system instilling within him a new courage and a feeling of utter well-being. “Go on down,” said he to Bridge. “The General an\u0027 I\u0027ll look after the kids—won\u0027t we bo?” “Sure,” assented The General; “we\u0027ll take care of \u0027em.” “I\u0027ll tell you what we\u0027ll do,” said Bridge; “we\u0027ll leave the kids up here and we three\u0027ll go down. They won\u0027t go, and I wouldn\u0027t leave them up here with you two morons on a bet.” The General and Dopey Charlie didn\u0027t know what a moron was but they felt quite certain from Bridge\u0027s tone of voice that a moron was not a nice thing, and anyway no one could have bribed them to descend into the darkness of the lower floor with the dead man and the grisly THING that prowled through the haunted chambers; so they flatly refused to budge an inch. Bridge saw in the gradually lighting sky the near approach of full daylight; so he contented himself with making the girl and the youth walk briskly to and fro in the hope that stimulated circulation might at least partially overcome the menace of the damp clothing and the chill air, and thus they occupied the remaining hour of the night. From below came no repetition of the inexplicable noises of that night of terror and at last, with every object plainly discernible in the light of the new day, Bridge would delay no longer; but voiced his final determination to descend and make a fire in the old kitchen stove. Both the boy and the girl insisted upon accompanying him. For the first time each had an opportunity to study the features of his companions of the night. Bridge found in the girl and the youth two dark eyed, good-looking young people. In the girl\u0027s face was, perhaps, just a trace of weakness; but it was not the face of one who consorts habitually with criminals. The man appraised her as a pretty, small-town girl who had been led into a temporary escapade by the monotony of village life, and he would have staked his soul that she was not a bad girl. The boy, too, looked anything other than the role he had been playing. Bridge smiled as he looked at the clear eyes, the oval face, and the fine, sensitive mouth and thought of the youth\u0027s claim to the crime battered sobriquet of The Oskaloosa Kid. The man wondered if the mystery of the clanking chain would prove as harmlessly infantile as these two whom some accident of hilarious fate had cast in the roles of debauchery and crime. Aloud, he said: “I\u0027ll go first, and if the spook materializes you two can beat it back into the room.” And to the two tramps: “Come on, boes, we\u0027ll all take a look at the lower floor together, and then we\u0027ll get a good fire going in the kitchen and warm up a bit.” Down the hall they went, Bridge leading with the boy and girl close at his heels while the two yeggs brought up the rear. Their footsteps echoed through the deserted house; but brought forth no answering clanking from the cellar. The stairs creaked beneath the unaccustomed weight of so many bodies as they descended toward the lower floor. Near the bottom Bridge came to a questioning halt. The front room lay entirely within his range of vision, and as his eyes swept it he gave voice to a short exclamation of surprise. The youth and the girl, shivering with cold and nervous excitement, craned their necks above the man\u0027s shoulder. “O-h-h!” gasped The Oskaloosa Kid. “He\u0027s gone,” and, sure enough, the dead man had vanished. Bridge stepped quickly down the remaining steps, entered the rear room which had served as dining room and kitchen, inspected the two small bedrooms off this room, and the summer kitchen beyond. All were empty; then he turned and re-entering the front room bent his steps toward the cellar stairs. At the foot of the stairway leading to the second floor lay the flash lamp that the boy had dropped the night before. Bridge stooped, picked it up and examined it. It was uninjured and with it in his hand he continued toward the cellar door. “Where are you going?” asked The Oskaloosa Kid. “I\u0027m going to solve the mystery of that infernal clanking,” he replied. “You are not going down into that dark cellar!” It was an appeal, a question, and a command; and it quivered gaspingly upon the verge of hysteria. Bridge turned and looked into the youth\u0027s face. The man did not like cowardice and his eyes were stern as he turned them on the lad from whom during the few hours of their acquaintance he had received so many evidences of cowardice; but as the clear brown eyes of the boy met his the man\u0027s softened and he shook his head perplexedly. What was there about this slender stripling which so disarmed criticism? “Yes,” he replied, “I am going down. I doubt if I shall find anything there; but if I do it is better to come upon it when I am looking for it than to have it come upon us when we are not expecting it. If there is to be any hunting I prefer to be hunter rather than hunted.” He wheeled and placed a foot upon the cellar stairs. The youth followed him. “What are you going to do?” asked the man. “I am going with you,” said the boy. “You think I am a coward because I am afraid; but there is a vast difference between cowardice and fear.” The man made no reply as he resumed the descent of the stairs, flashing the rays of the lamp ahead of him; but he pondered the boy\u0027s words and smiled as he admitted mentally that it undoubtedly took more courage to do a thing in the face of fear than to do it if fear were absent. He felt a strange elation that this youth should choose voluntarily to share his danger with him, for in his roaming life Bridge had known few associates for whom he cared. The beams of the little electric lamp, moving from side to side, revealed a small cellar littered with refuse and festooned with cob-webs. At one side tottered the remains of a series of wooden racks upon which pans of milk had doubtless stood to cool in a long gone, happier day. Some of the uprights had rotted away so that a part of the frail structure had collapsed to the earthen floor. A table with one leg missing and a crippled chair constituted the balance of the contents of the cellar and there was no living creature and no chain nor any other visible evidence of the presence which had clanked so lugubriously out of the dark depths during the vanished night. The boy breathed a heartfelt sigh of relief and Bridge laughed, not without a note of relief either. “You see there is nothing,” he said—“nothing except some firewood which we can use to advantage. I regret that James is not here to attend me; but since he is not you and I will have to carry some of this stuff upstairs,” and together they returned to the floor above, their arms laden with pieces of the dilapidated milk rack. The girl was awaiting them at the head of the stairs while the two tramps whispered together at the opposite side of the room. It took Bridge but a moment to have a roaring fire started in the old stove in the kitchen, and as the warmth rolled in comforting waves about them the five felt for the first time in hours something akin to relief and well being. With the physical relaxation which the heat induced came a like relaxation of their tongues and temporary forgetfulness of their antagonisms and individual apprehensions. Bridge was the only member of the group whose conscience was entirely free. He was not \u0027wanted\u0027 anywhere, he had no unexpiated crimes to harry his mind, and with the responsibilities of the night removed he fell naturally into his old, carefree manner. He hazarded foolish explanations of the uncanny noises of the night and suggested various theories to account for the presence and the mysterious disappearance of the dead man. The General, on the contrary, seriously maintained that the weird sounds had emanated from the ghost of the murdered man who was, unquestionably, none other than the long dead Squibb returned to haunt his former home, and that the scream had sprung from the ghostly lungs of his slain wife or daughter. “I wouldn\u0027t spend anudder night in this dump,” he concluded, “for both them pockets full of swag The Oskaloosa Kid\u0027s packin\u0027 around.” Immediately all eyes turned upon the flushing youth. The girl and Bridge could not prevent their own gazes from wandering to the bulging coat pockets, the owner of which moved uneasily, at last shooting a look of defiance, not unmixed with pleading, at Bridge. “He\u0027s a bad one,” interjected Dopey Charlie, a glint of cunning in his ordinarily glassy eyes. “He flashes a couple o\u0027 mitsful of sparklers, chesty-like, and allows as how he\u0027s a regular burglar. Then he pulls a gun on me, as wasn\u0027t doin\u0027 nothin\u0027 to him, and \u0027most croaks me. It\u0027s even money that if anyone\u0027s been croaked in Oakdale last night they won\u0027t have to look far for the guy that done it. Least-wise they won\u0027t have to look far if he doesn\u0027t come across,” and Dopey Charlie looked meaningly and steadily at the side pockets of The Oskaloosa Kid. “I think,” said Bridge, after a moment of general silence, “that you two crooks had better beat it. Do you get me?” and he looked from Dopey Charlie to The General and back again. “We don\u0027t go,” said Dopey Charlie, belligerently, “until we gets half the Kid\u0027s swag.” “You go now,” said Bridge, “without anybody\u0027s swag,” and he drew the boy\u0027s automatic from his side pocket. “You go now and you go quick—beat it!” The two rose and shuffled toward the door. “We\u0027ll get you, you colledge Lizzy,” threatened Dopey Charlie, “an\u0027 we\u0027ll get that phoney punk, too.” “\u0027And speed the parting guest,\u0027” quoted Bridge, firing a shot that splintered the floor at the crook\u0027s feet. When the two hoboes had departed the others huddled again close to the stove until Bridge suggested that he and The Oskaloosa Kid retire to another room while the girl removed and dried her clothing; but she insisted that it was not wet enough to matter since she had been covered by a robe in the automobile until just a moment before she had been hurled out. “Then, after you are warmed up,” said Bridge, “you can step into this other room while the kid and I strip and dry our things, for there\u0027s no question but that we are wet enough.” At the suggestion the kid started for the door. “Oh, no,” he insisted; “it isn\u0027t worth while. I am almost dry now, and as soon as we get out on the road I\u0027ll be all right. I—I—I like wet clothes,” he ended, lamely. Bridge looked at him questioningly; but did not urge the matter. “Very well,” he said; “you probably know what you like; but as for me, I\u0027m going to pull off every rag and get good and dry.” The girl had already quitted the room and now The Kid turned and followed her. Bridge shook his head. “I\u0027ll bet the little beggar never was away from his mother before in his life,” he mused; “why the mere thought of undressing in front of a strange man made him turn red—and posing as The Oskaloosa Kid! Bless my soul; but he\u0027s a humorist—a regular, natural born one.” Bridge found that his clothing had dried to some extent during the night; so, after a brisk rub, he put on the warmed garments and though some were still a trifle damp he felt infinitely more comfortable than he had for many hours. Outside the house he came upon the girl and the youth standing in the sunshine of a bright, new day. They were talking together in a most animated manner, and as he approached wondering what the two had found of so great common interest he discovered that the discussion hinged upon the relative merits of ham and bacon as a breakfast dish. “Oh, my heart it is just achin\u0027,” quoted Bridge, “For a little bite of bacon, “A hunk of bread, a little mug of brew; “I\u0027m tired of seein\u0027 scenery, “Just lead me to a beanery “Where there\u0027s something more than only air to chew.” The two looked up, smiling. “You\u0027re a funny kind of tramp, to be quoting poetry,” said The Oskaloosa Kid, “even if it is Knibbs\u0027.” “Almost as funny,” replied Bridge, “as a burglar who recognizes Knibbs when he hears him.” The Oskaloosa Kid flushed. “He wrote for us of the open road,” he replied quickly. “I don\u0027t know of any other class of men who should enjoy him more.” “Or any other class that is less familiar with him,” retorted Bridge; “but the burning question just now is pots, not poetry—flesh pots. I\u0027m hungry. I could eat a cow.” The girl pointed to an adjacent field. “Help yourself,” she said. “That happens to be a bull,” said Bridge. “I was particular to mention cow, which, in this instance, is proverbially less dangerous than the male, and much better eating. “\u0027We kept a-rambling all the time. I rustled grub, he rustled rhyme— “\u0027Blind baggage, hoof it, ride or climb—we always put it through.\u0027 Who\u0027s going to rustle the grub?” The girl looked at The Oskaloosa Kid. “You don\u0027t seem like a tramp at all, to talk to,” she said; “but I suppose you are used to asking for food. I couldn\u0027t do it—I should die if I had to.” The Oskaloosa Kid looked uncomfortable. “So should—” he commenced, and then suddenly subsided. “Of course I\u0027d just as soon,” he said. “You two stay here—I\u0027ll be back in a minute.” They watched him as he walked down to the road and until he disappeared over the crest of the hill a short distance from the Squibbs\u0027 house. “I like him,” said the girl, turning toward Bridge. “So do I,” replied the man. “There must be some good in him,” she continued, “even if he is such a desperate character; but I know he\u0027s not The Oskaloosa Kid. Do you really suppose he robbed a house last night and then tried to kill that Dopey person?” Bridge shook his head. “I don\u0027t know,” he said; “but I am inclined to believe that he is more imaginative than criminal. He certainly shot up the Dopey person; but I doubt if he ever robbed a house.” While they waited, The Oskaloosa Kid trudged along the muddy road to the nearest farm house, which lay a full mile beyond the Squibbs\u0027 home. As he approached the door a lank, sallow man confronted him with a suspicious eye. “Good morning,” greeted The Oskaloosa Kid. The man grunted. “I want to get something to eat,” explained the youth. If the boy had hurled a dynamite bomb at him the result could have been no more surprising. The lank, sallow man went up into the air, figuratively. He went up a mile or more, and on the way down he reached his hand inside the kitchen door and brought it forth enveloping the barrel of a shot gun. “Durn ye!” he cried. “I\u0027ll lam ye! Get offen here. I knows ye. Yer one o\u0027 that gang o\u0027 bums that come here last night, an\u0027 now you got the gall to come back beggin\u0027 for food, eh? I\u0027ll lam ye!” and he raised the gun to his shoulder. The Oskaloosa Kid quailed but he held his ground. “I wasn\u0027t here last night,” he cried, “and I\u0027m not begging for food—I want to buy some. I\u0027ve got plenty of money,” in proof of which assertion he dug into a side pocket and brought forth a large roll of bills. The man lowered his gun. “Wy didn\u0027t ye say so in the first place then?” he growled. “How\u0027d I know you wanted to buy it, eh? Where\u0027d ye come from anyhow, this early in the mornin\u0027? What\u0027s yer name, eh? What\u0027s yer business, that\u0027s what Jeb Case\u0027d like to know, eh?” He snapped his words out with the rapidity of a machine gun, nor waited for a reply to one query before launching the next. “What do ye want to buy, eh? How much money ye got? Looks suspicious. That\u0027s a sight o\u0027 money yew got there, eh? Where\u0027dje get it?” “It\u0027s mine,” said The Oskaloosa Kid, “and I want to buy some eggs and milk and ham and bacon and flour and onions and sugar and cream and strawberries and tea and coffee and a frying pan and a little oil stove, if you have one to spare, and—” Jeb Case\u0027s jaw dropped and his eyes widened. “You\u0027re in the wrong pasture, bub,” he remarked feelingly. “What yer lookin\u0027 fer is Sears, Roebuck \u0026 Company.” The Oskaloosa Kid flushed up to the tips of his ears. “But can\u0027t you sell me something?” he begged. “I might let ye have some milk an\u0027 eggs an\u0027 butter an\u0027 a leetle bacon an\u0027 mebby my ol\u0027 woman\u0027s got a loaf left from her last bakin\u0027; but we ain\u0027t been figgerin\u0027 on supplyin\u0027 grub fer the United States army ef that\u0027s what yew be buyin\u0027 fer.” A frowsy, rat-faced woman and a gawky youth of fourteen stuck their heads out the doorway at either side of the man. “I ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 to sell,” snapped the woman; but as she spoke her eyes fell upon the fat bank roll in the youth\u0027s hand. “Or, leastwise,” she amended, “I ain\u0027t got much more\u0027n we need an\u0027 the price o\u0027 stuff\u0027s gone up so lately that I\u0027ll hev to ask ye more\u0027n I would of last fall. \u0027Bout what did ye figger on wantin\u0027?” “Anything you can spare,” said the youth. “There are three of us and we\u0027re awful hungry.” “Where yew stoppin\u0027?” asked the woman. “We\u0027re at the old Squibbs\u0027 place,” replied The Kid. “We got caught by the storm last night and had to put up there.” “The Squibbs\u0027 place!” ejaculated the woman. “Yew didn\u0027t stop there over night?” “Yes we did,” replied the youth. “See anything funny?” asked Mrs. Case. “We didn\u0027t SEE anything,” replied The Oskaloosa Kid; “but we heard things. At least we didn\u0027t see what we heard; but we saw a dead man on the floor when we went in and this morning he was gone.” The Cases shuddered. “A dead man!” ejaculated Jeb Case. “Yew seen him?” The Kid nodded. “I never tuk much stock in them stories,” said Jeb, with a shake of his head; “but ef you SEEN it! Gosh! Thet beats me. Come on M\u0027randy, les see what we got to spare,” and he turned into the kitchen with his wife. The lanky boy stepped out, and planting himself in front of The Oskaloosa Kid proceeded to stare at him. “Yew seen it?” he asked in awestruck tone. “Yes,” said the Kid in a low voice, and bending close toward the other; “it had bloody froth on its lips!” The Case boy shrank back. “An\u0027 what did yew hear?” he asked, a glutton for thrills. “Something that dragged a chain behind it and came up out of the cellar and tried to get in our room on the second floor,” explained the youth. “It almost got us, too,” he added, “and it did it all night.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928/80501.html","bookId":17,"book":{"id":17,"title":"The Oakdale Affair","description":"简介： The house on the hill showed lights only upon the first floorin the spacious reception hall, the dining room, and those more or less mysterious purlieus thereof from which emanate disagreeable odors and agreeable foods....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/2928","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
