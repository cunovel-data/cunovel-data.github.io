{"id":31663,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII In the Hands of the Reds","content":"The next morning Harry went out, as usual, immediately after breakfast, for a walk for two or three hours. This he did partly to allow the girls to tidy the rooms, an office which had naturally fallen to them since the commencement of their old nurse\u0027s illness; partly because in active exercise he found some relief from the burden of his anxieties. To-day he felt more anxious than ever. The conversation with Marthe Pichon had afforded good grounds of hope that in a day or two a fair prospect of escape would be open to them; but this only seemed to make the present anxiety all the sharper. The woman had promised to get disguises, and make the arrangements with her friends at the village below during the course of the day, and by night, if all went well, they might start. He told himself that he had no reason for supposing that the vague suspicions which were, he knew, afloat would suddenly be converted into action. He determined to take his place that afternoon with the committee as usual, and endeavour to allay their doubts by assuming a violent attitude. He felt, however, that the day would be more trying than any he had passed, and that he would give a great deal if the next twenty-four hours were over. Scarcely heeding where he walked he was out longer than usual, and it was nearly three hours after he started before he approached the town again by the road along the river bank. Just when he came to the first houses a woman, who was standing there knitting, came up to him. \"You are the citizen who lives with his two sisters next door to La Mere Pichon, are you not?\" Harry assented hurriedly, with a strange presentiment of evil. \"La Mere Pichon bids me tell you,\" the woman said, \"that half an hour after you started this morning six men, with an official with the red scarf, came to the house and arrested your sisters and carried them off. They are watching there for your return.\" Harry staggered as if struck with a blow. \"Poor young man,\" the woman said compassionately, seeing the ghastly pallor of his face, \"but I pity you. The street is furious that these wretches should have carried off that sweet young creature, who was so good to everyone; but what could we do? We hissed the men, and we would have pelted them had we not been afraid of striking your sisters. When they had gone La Mere Pichon said to some of us, \u0027The best thing we can do for that angel is to save her brother from being caught also. So do one of you post yourself on each road leading to the house, and warn him in time. He generally walks beyond the town. I heard one of his sisters say so.\u0027 So some of us came out on all the roads, and two remained, one at each end of the street, in case we should miss you. La Mere said, whoever met you was to tell you to be on this road, by the river, just outside the town, after dark, and she would bring you some clothes, and take you where you would be safe; but till then you were to go away again, and keep far from the town. Do you understand?\" she asked, laying her hand on his arm, for he seemed dazed and stupid with the shock he had received. \"I understand,\" he said in a low voice. \"Thank you all for your warning. Yes, I will be here this evening.\" So saying he turned and moved away, walking unsteadily as if he were drunk. The woman looked after him pityingly, and then, shaking her head and muttering execrations against the \"Reds,\" she made her way home to tell Mere Pichon that she had fulfilled her mission. Harry walked on slowly until some distance from the town, and then threw himself down on a bank by the road and lay for a time silent and despairing. At last tears came to his relief, and his broad shoulders shook with a passion of sobbing to think that just at the moment when a chance of escape was opened—just when all the dangers seemed nearly past—the girls should have fallen into the hands of the enemy, and he not there to strike a blow in their defence. To think of Jeanne—his bright, fearless Jeanne—and clinging little Virginie, in the hands of these human tigers. It was maddening! But after a time the passion of weeping calmed down, and Harry sat up suddenly. \"I am a fool,\" he said as he rose to his feet; \"a nice sort of fellow for a protector, lying here crying like a girl when I had begun to fancy I was a man; wasting my time here when I know the only hope for the girls is for me to keep myself free to help them. I need not lose all hope yet. After Marie has been saved, why shouldn\u0027t I save my Jeanne? I am better off than I was then, for we have friends who will help. These women whose hearts Jeanne has won will aid if they can, and may get some of their husbands and brothers to aid. The battle is not lost yet, and Jeanne will know I shall move heaven and earth to save her.\" Harry\u0027s fit of crying, unmanly as he felt it, had afforded him an immense relief, for he hardly knew himself how great the strain had been upon him of late, and with a more elastic step he strode away into the country, and for hours walked on, revolving plan after plan in his mind for rescuing the girls. Although nothing very plausible had occurred to him he felt brighter in mind, though weary in body, when, just after nightfall, he again approached the spot where he had that morning received so heavy a blow. He was not disheartened at the difficulty before him, for he knew that he should have some time yet to hit upon a a plan, and the jails were so crowded with prisoners that he might fairly reckon upon weeks before there was any actual necessity for action. Marthe Pichon was waiting for him. \"Ah, Monsieur,\" she began, \"but this is a terrible day! Oh, if I had but known a day or two earlier they could have moved in time, and now they are in the power of those wolves; but we will try to save them. We have been talking it over. We will all go to the tribunal, and we will take our husbands and our children with us, and we will demand their release. We will not let them be murdered. And now here are the clothes, but you need not put them on now. There will be a boat here in a few minutes. We have told some of the sailors how they misjudged you, and they are sorry, now it is too late, that they would not listen when you spoke to them. However, they will do all they can for you. I have sent a message by a boy to my sister to say that I shall be down this evening, so they will be expecting us. Ah, here is the boat!\" The splash of oars was heard, and a boat rowed along close to the bank. \"Is that you, Pierre?\" \"It is us, sure enough, Mere Pichon. Is all right?\" \"Yes, we are both here.\" In another minute the boat was rowed alongside, and Harry and the woman got on board. There were few words spoken as the two men rowed vigorously down stream. In three quarters of an hour some lights were seen on the opposite bank, and the boat was headed towards them and soon reached a little causeway. \"I shall not be more than twenty minutes,\" Mere Pichon said as she got out. \"All right, we will wait!\" was the reply, and mounting the causeway La Mere Pichon led the way to the farthest cottage in the little fishing-village. A light was burning within, and lifting the latch she entered, followed by Harry. A fisherman and his wife were sitting by the fire. \"Here, sister Henriette and brother Pierre,\" Marthe said; \"you have heard from me how a dear angel, who lived next door to me, has nursed and tended my little Julie, and by blessing of the Virgin brought her round from her illness; and those wretches, the Reds, have carried her off to-day with her sister, and you know what it is to fall into their hands. This is her brother, and I am going to ask you to give him shelter and let him stay here with you. I have brought him a suit of clothes with me, and no one will guess that he is not the son of some comrade of yours. He will pay you well for sheltering him till we can put him on board Adolphe\u0027s lugger and send him across the water. If it had not been that the Reds had come to-day I should have brought his sisters with him. I was just starting to arrange it with you when those wretches came and took them away, and it may be that they would pay a hundred crowns to you, and that is not a sum to be earned every day.\" \"No, indeed,\" her sister said briskly; \"that will buy Pierre a new boat, and a good one, such as he can go out to sea in; besides, as you say, after what his sister did for Julie we are bound to help them. What do you say, Pierre?\" Pierre\u0027s face had expressed anything but satisfaction until the money was mentioned, but it then changed entirely. The times were bad—his boat was old and unseaworthy—a hundred crowns was a fortune to him. \"I have risked my life often,\" he said, \"to earn five crowns, therefore I do not say no to the offer. Monsieur, I accept; for a hundred crowns I will run the risk of keeping you here, and your sisters too if they should come, until you can cross the water.\" \"Very well then,\" Marthe Pichon said. \"That\u0027s settled, now I shall be off at once. They will be watching the street for monsieur, and to-morrow, when they find he has not come back, they will be asking questions, so the sooner I am back the better.\" \"We cannot give you much accommodation, monsieur,\" the fisherman said. \"There is only the loft upstairs, and, for to-night, the sails to sleep on; but we will try and make you more comfortable to-morrow.\" \"I care nothing for comfort,\" Harry answered, \"so make no change for me. Just treat me as if I were what I shall seem to be—a young fisherman who has come to work with you for a bit. I will row with you and help you with your nets. Your sister has promised to send a boy every day with all the news she can gather. Now, if you have a piece of bread I will gladly eat it, for I have touched nothing since breakfast.\" \"We can do better than that for you,\" the woman replied, and in a few minutes some fish were frying over the fire. Fortunately the long hours he had been on his feet had thoroughly tired Harry out, and after eating his supper he at once ascended to the loft, threw himself on the heap of sails, and in a few minutes was sound asleep. The next morning he dressed himself in the fisherman\u0027s clothes with which he had been provided, and went down stairs. \"You will do,\" Pierre said, looking at him; \"but your hands and face are too white. But I was tanning my sails yesterday, and there is some of the stuff left in the boiler; if you rub your hands and face with that you will do well.\" Harry took the advice, and the effect was to give him the appearance of a lad whose face was bronzed by long exposure to the sea and air. \"You will pass anywhere now,\" Pierre said approvingly. \"I shall give out that you belong to St. Nazaire, and are the son of a friend of mine whose fishing-boat was lost in the last gale, and so you have come to work for a time with me; no one would ask you any more. Besides, we are all comrades, and hate the Reds, who have spoilt our trade by killing all our best customers, so if they come asking questions here they won\u0027t get a word out of anyone.\" For ten days Harry lived with the fisherman. Adolphe had returned in his lugger the day after his arrival there, and came over the next evening to see him. He said that it would be some little time before the lugger sailed again, but that if he was ready to start before she sailed he would manage to procure him a passage in some other craft. He said that he had already been talking to some of the sailors on the wharves, and that they had promised to go to the Tribunal when the girls were brought up before it, and that he would manage to get news from a friend employed in the prison when that would be. Harry frequently went up in a boat to Nantes with Pierre with the fish they had caught. He had no fear of being recognized, and did not hesitate to land, though he seldom went far from the boat. Adolphe was generally there, and he and two or three of his comrades, who were in the secret, always hailed him as an old acquaintance, so that had any of the spies of the Revolutionists been standing there, no suspicion that Harry was other than he seemed would have entered their minds. One evening, three weeks after Harry\u0027s arrival at the hut, Adolphe came in with his head bound up by a bandage. \"What is the matter, Adolphe?\" Harry exclaimed. \"I have bad news for you, monsieur. I learned this morning that mesdemoiselles were to-day to be brought before the Tribunal, and we filled the hall with women and two or three score of sailors. Mesdemoiselles were brought out. The young one seemed frightened, but the elder was as calm and brave as if she feared nothing. They were asked their names, and she said: \"\u0027I am Jeanne de St. Caux, and this is my sister Virginie. We have committed no crime.\u0027 \"Carrier himself was there, and he said: \"\u0027You are charged with being enemies of France, with being here in disguise, and with trying to leave France contrary to the laws against emigration, and with being in company with one who, under false pretenses, obtained admission to the Committee of Safety here, but who is an enemy and traitor to France. What do you say?\u0027 \"\u0027I do not deny that we were in disguise,\u0027 she said in her clear voice. \u0027Nor do I deny that we should have escaped if we could. And as you treat us as enemies, and our lives are in danger, I cannot see that we were to blame in doing so. I deny that we are enemies of France, or that the gentleman who was with us was so either. He did not obtain a place on the committee by fraud, for he was really the secretary of Monsieur Robespierre, and he could not refuse the post when it was offered to him.\u0027 \"Then we thought it was time to speak, and the women cried out for mercy, and said how good she had been to the poor; and we men cried out too. And then Carrier got into a passion, and said they were traitors and worthy of death, and that they should die. And we shouted we would not have it, and broke into the Tribunal and surrounded mesdemoiselles, and then the guards rushed in and there was a fight. We beat them off and got outside, and then a regiment came up, and they were too strong for us, though we fought stoutly, I can tell you, for our blood was up; but it was no use. The dear ladies were captured again, and many of us got severe wounds. But the feeling was strong, I can tell you, among the sailors when the news spread through the town, for some of the women got hurt, too, in the melee, and I think we could get five hundred men together to storm the jail.\" Harry was bitterly disappointed, for he had hoped that the intercession of the women might have availed with the judges, and doubtless would have done so had not Carrier himself been present. However, he thanked the sailor warmly for the efforts he had made and gave him some money to distribute among the wounded, for he always carried half his money concealed in a belt under his clothes. The other half was hidden away under a board in his lodgings, so that in case of his being captured the girls would still have funds available for their escape. As to the prospects of storming the jail he did not feel sanguine. It was strongly guarded, and there were three regiments of troops in the town, and these could be brought up before the fishermen could force the strong defences of the jail. However, as a last resource, this might be attempted. Two days later Adolphe again returned, and was obliged to confess in answer to Harry\u0027s inquiries that he feared the sailors as a body would not join in the attempt. \"I can hardly blame them, monsieur. For though I myself would risk everything, and some of the others would do so too, it is a terrible thing for men with wives and families to brave the anger of these monsters. They would think nothing of putting us all to death. It isn\u0027t the fighting we are afraid of, though the odds are heavy against us, but it\u0027s the vengeance they would take afterwards, whether we happened to win or whether we didn\u0027t.\" \"I cannot blame them,\" Harry said. \"As you say, even if they succeeded there would be a terrible vengeance for it afterwards. No; if the girls are to be rescued it must be by some other way. I have been quiet so long because I hoped that the intercession of the women would have saved them. As that has failed I must set to work. I have thought of every method, but bribery seems the only chance. Will you speak to the man you know in the prison, and sound him whether it will be possible to carry out any plan in that way?\" \"I will speak again to him,\" Adolphe said. \"But I have already sounded him, and he said that there were so many guards and jailers that he feared that it would be impossible. But I will try again.\" The next day, soon after dinner, Adolphe came again, and there was a white scared look upon his face which filled Harry with alarm. \"What is it, Adolphe? What is your news?\" \"Monsieur, I can hardly tell it,\" Adolphe said in a low awe-stricken voice. \"It is too awful even for these fiends.\" \"What is it, Adolphe? Tell me. If they have been murdered I will go straight to Nantes and kill Carrier the first time he leaves his house, though they may tear me to pieces afterwards.\" \"They are not murdered yet,\" Adolphe said; \"but they are to be, and everyone else.\" And this time the sailor sat down and cried like a child. At last, in answer to Harry\u0027s entreaties, he raised his head and told the story. The Revolutionary Committee had that day been down at the wharf, and had taken for the public service four old luggers past service which were lying on the mud, and they had openly boasted that an end was going to put to the aristocrats; that the guillotine was too slow, that the prison must be cleared, and that they were going to pack the aristocrats on board the luggers and sink them. Harry gave a cry of horror, in which the fisherman and his wife joined, the latter pouring out voluble curses against Carrier and the Reds. After his first cry Harry was silent; he sank down on to a low chair, and sat there with his face hidden in his hands for some minutes, while the fisherman and his wife poured question after question upon Adolphe. Presently Harry rose to his feet, and saying to Adolphe, \"Do not go away, I shall be back presently, I must think by myself,\" went out bareheaded into the night. It was half an hour before he returned. \"Now, Adolphe,\" he said, \"I can think again. Now, how are they to be saved?\" \"I cannot say, monsieur,\" Adolphe said hesitatingly. \"It does not seem to me—\" \"They have to be saved,\" Harry interrupted him in a grave, steady voice. \"The question is how?\" \"Yes, monsieur,\" Adolphe agreed hesitatingly, \"that is the question. You can rely upon me, monsieur,\" he went on, \"to do my best whatever you may decide; but I have no head to invent things. You tell me and I will do it.\" \"I know I can rely upon you, Adolphe. As far as I can see there are but two ways. One is for me to go to Carrier\u0027s house, find the monster, place a pistol at his head, compel him to order them to be released, stand with him at the prison door till they come out, embark with him and them in a boat, row down the river, and put to sea.\" \"And then, monsieur?\" Adolphe asked after a pause, seeing that Harry was speaking to himself rather than to him. \"Yes, that is the question that I cannot answer,\" Harry replied. \"I can see all the rest as if it were passing. I can feel Carrier trembling in my grasp, and shrinking as the pistol touches his forehead. I can hear him giving his orders, I can see the crowd falling back as I walk with him through the street, I can hear him crying to the people to stand aside and let us pass, I can see us going down the river together; but what am I to do in a boat with two ladies at sea?\" \"Could you not embark in a lugger?\" Adolphe exclaimed, carried away by the picture which Harry seemed to be describing as if he saw it. \"Why not start in a lugger at once? I might have the Trois Freres ready, and the men will all stand by you; and when we are once outside the river we will throw Carrier over to the fishes and make for England.\" \"Thank you, Adolphe. If the other plans seem impossible we will try that, but only as a last resource; for I know the chances are a hundred to one against its success. I should have no fear as to Carrier himself, but as I went through the streets some one else might place a musket at the back of my head and shoot me. If I could get him alone it would be different. You could go with me; I would force him to sign the order of release; you could take it; and I would stand over him till you had time to embark with them; then I would blow out his brains and make my way down to the river. But there would be no chance of finding him alone. Monsters like this are always fearful of assassination.\" \"And what is monsieur\u0027s other plan?\" \"The other plan is to get on board the boat in which they are to be placed—you might find out which it is from your friend in prison—hide down in the hold until the guards leave her; then join them; and when she sinks fasten them to a spar and drift down the river with them till out of sight of the town, when Pierre could row off and pick them up.\" \"They say there are to be soldiers on each side of the river,\" Adolphe said despondently, \"to shoot down any who may try to swim to shore. But there would not be many who would try. Most of them, they say, will be women and children; but the heads would be seen as you drifted down.\" \"Yes; but we must think of something, Adolphe—think, man, think—and you, Pierre, think; if you were in a sinking ship, and you wanted something which would hide you from the eyes of people a hundred yards away, what would you take?\" \"But you would be seen on anything you climbed on to or clung to, monsieur. \"But we need not climb on to it,\" Harry said. \"I can take pieces of cork with me and wrap round them so as to keep their faces just afloat. I should only want something that would hide their faces.\" \"A hatch might do,\" Pierre said. \"The very thing!\" Harry exclaimed with a fresh ring of animation and hopefulness in his voice. \"The very thing! Of course there would be a hatchway to the forecastle of the lugger. We might get that loosened beforehand, so that it would float off. What is the size of such a hatch?\" \"Some four feet square, monsieur.\" \"That will be enough,\" Harry said; \"but how high would a hatch float out of water, because there must be room between the top of the water for us to breathe as we lie on our backs. Four inches would be enough. Are the sides buoyant enough to keep the top that much out of water?\" \"I do not think so, monsieur,\" Pierre said with a shake of the head. \"It would float nearly level with the water.\" \"But see here, monsieur,\" Adolphe said eagerly; \"I have an idea! The hatches are covered with tarpaulin. If you could hide in the forecastle during the night you might cut away all the top underneath the tarpaulin and prop it up, so that if anyone trod on it in the morning they would not notice what had been done. Then when they have pushed off you could knock away the props, the board would tumble down, and there would be only the tarpaulin cover on the sides. It would float then quite four inches out of the water, and that in the middle of the stream would look almost level with it.\" \"I will try it,\" Harry said; \"there is a chance of success.\" \"It is a terrible risk, monsieur,\" Pierre said. \"I know it,\" Harry replied; \"but it is just possible. The chances are a hundred to one against it, but it may succeed. Well, Pierre, do you be with your boat on the river just below the point where the town can be seen. If you see a hatch floating down row to it. If we are beneath it, well and good; if not—\" \"If not, monsieur,\" the fisherman\u0027s wife said solemnly, \"we will pray for your souls.\" \"Adolphe will send down to you in the morning the two fisher-girls\u0027 dresses his wife had prepared for the ladies. Have some brandy in the boat and your little charcoal stove, and keep water boiling. They will want it. And now good-bye, my good friends! Pray for us to-night. Now, Adolphe, let us hasten back to the town, for there is much to be done. And first of all you must see your friend in the prison; find out if mesdemoiselles are on the list of those to be murdered. I have no doubt they will be, for after the emeute there has been about them they are almost sure to be among the first victims. But above all, find out, if you can, which vessel they are to be placed in. \"But if I cannot find that out, monsieur; if there is no arrangement made at all—though I should think there would be, for the butchers will like to have everything done in order—\" \"Then I will get you to find a dozen men you can trust to volunteer to row the boats to put them on board. And you must be sure to take the boat in which they are to the lugger we have prepared.\" \"I will try,\" Adolphe said, \"though I would rather cut off my hand than pull an oar to take these poor creatures out to be murdered. But I will do it, monsieur. But except for that I warrant me they will not get a sailor in Nantes to put his hand to an oar to aid their accursed work.\" It was four o\u0027clock when they arrived at Nantes. Adolphe went straight to the prison, while Harry walked along the quay. When he came abreast the centre of the town a number of sailors and fishermen were standing talking in low tones, and looking with horror at four luggers moored in a line in the centre of the river. A number of men drawn from the scum of the town were painting them white, while a strong body of troops were drawn up on the quay in readiness to put a summary stop to any demonstration of hostility on the part of the sailors. These did not indeed venture to express openly their detestation of the proceedings, but the muttered execrations and curses that rose from the little group showed how deep were their feelings. Harry joined a little knot of three or four men who had been, with Adolphe, in the habit of greeting him when he landed. \"All is lost, you see!\" one of them said in a tone of deep commiseration. \"There is nothing left but vengeance—we will take that one of these days—but that is a poor consolation for you now.\" \"All is not quite lost,\" Harry said. \"I have yet one hope.\" \"We dare not try force,\" one of the other men said. \"They have marched three more regiments of Reds in to-day. What can we do against them without arms? I could cry to think that we are so helpless in the face of these things.\" \"No; I know force is useless,\" Harry said. \"Still I have just one hope left. It is a desperate one, and I cannot tell you what it is now; but to-night, maybe, Adolphe may ask you to help us. I expect him here soon.\" In half an hour Adolphe returned, and Harry at once joined him. \"I have got the news I wanted,\" he said. \"Mesdemoiselles are to be in the first batch brought out. Boats have already been bought by the Reds to row them out, and men hired. They were forced to buy the boats, for not a man would let his craft for such a purpose. It would be accursed ever afterwards, no sailor would ever put a foot on board. The first boats will go to the ship lying lowest in the stream; then they will come back and take the next batch out to the vessel next above; and so until all are on board. There will be fifty placed on board each lugger; and I hear, monsieur, that is only the first of it, and that the drownings will go on until the prisons are cleared.\" \"Thank God we know that much, Adolphe! Now, in the first place, I want you to get me some tools—a sharp saw, a chisel, a large screw-driver, and half a dozen large screws; also, two beams of wood to fasten across the hatchway and keep the boards up after I have sawn through them; also, I want three bundles of cork—flat pieces will be the best if you can get them, but that doesn\u0027t matter much. I may as well have an auger too. When you go back to your house will you go in next door and ask our landlady, Mere Leflo—\" \"She died three days ago,\" the man said. \"Then go into the house without asking, and in the farthest corner to the right-hand side of the kitchen scratch away the earth, and you will find a little bag of money. If I fail to-morrow, keep it for yourself; if I succeed, bring it to me at Pierre\u0027s. When does your lugger sail for England?\" \"In three days, monsieur. I have already sounded the captain, and I think he will take you. And what shall I do next?\" \"At nine o\u0027clock this evening have a boat with the things on board half a mile below the town. Give a low whistle, and I will answer it. Wrap some flannel round the rowlocks to muffle the sound. It will be a dark night, and there\u0027s a mist rising already from the river. I do not think there\u0027s much chance of our meeting any boats near those vessels.\" \"No, indeed,\" Adolphe agreed. \"It makes me shiver to look at them. There will be no boat out on the river to-night except ours. Will you not come home with me, monsieur, until it is time to start? You will need supper, for you must keep up your strength.\" Harry accepted the sailor\u0027s invitation; and after partaking of a meal with Adolphe and his wife, who was informed of the attempt which was about to be made, he sat looking quietly into the fire, arranging in his mind all the details of the enterprise, uttering many a silent but fervent prayer that he might be permitted to save the lives of the two girls. Adolphe went in and out making his preparations. At half-past eight he said, touching Harry on the shoulder: \"It is time to start, monsieur. I have got the bag of money. Everything is in the boat, and I saw the men start with it. It is time for us to go and meet them.\" Marthe burst into tears as she said good-bye to Harry. \"I shall spend all night on my knees,\" she said, \"praying God and the Holy Virgin to aid you and save those dear angels. Here is a packet, monsieur, with some food for you to eat in the morning, and a bottle of good wine. You will want strength for your adventure.\" Three or four minutes after Harry and Adolphe had gained the appointed spot they heard a low whistle on the water. Adolphe whistled in return, and in another minute a dark object appeared through the mist. They took their places in the stern, and the boat rowed quietly off again. So well were the oars muffled that Harry could hear no sound save an almost imperceptible splash each time they dipped into the water. The town was very still and scarce a sound was heard. The awe of the horrible event which was about to take place hung over the town, and although there was drinking and exultations among the ruffians in the back lanes, even these instinctively avoided the neighbourhood of the river. So thick was the fog that they were some little time before they found the white luggers. When they did so they rowed to that moored lowest down the stream and made fast alongside. Noiselessly the tools and beams were handed on board. Then Harry said: \"That is all, Adolphe.\" \"Not at all, monsieur. We are not going to leave you till the work is done. We have settled that four sets of hands can work better than one, and besides, we may hit on some idea. No one can say.\" Finding it useless to remonstrate, Harry let the good fellows have their way. The men had already removed their boots, and noiselessly made their way to the hatch of the forecastle. \"Ah, it is just as well I brought a file with me,\" Adolphe said in a low voice, as he knelt down and felt the hatch. \"It is fastened down with a staple and padlock. They are old, but you might have some trouble in breaking them. But let us see first. No, it moves. Now, a wrench all together.\" As he spoke the staple came up through the rotten wood of the deck. The hatch was then lifted. \"Lower it down corner-ways into the fo\u0027castle,\" Adolphe said. \"We can work all the better at it there. Jacques, do you get that sail up out of the boat and throw it over the hatch. It isn\u0027t likely anyone will come out here through the fog; but it\u0027s just as well not to run any risk.\" As soon as all were below, and the sail spread over the opening above, Adolphe produced a dark lantern from the great pocket of his fisherman\u0027s cloak, together with two or three candles. These were lit at the lantern, and the party then set to work. Two saws had been brought on board, and a piece three feet square was cut out of the top of the hatch, leaving six inches of wood all round. Great pains were taken not to saw through the tarpaulin cover. \"Now, the next thing to do,\" Harry said, \"is to fix the beams so as to hold the wood in its place again.\" Four pieces of wood, each three inches long, were screwed against the combing of the hatchway in such a position that when the beams were placed upon them they were exactly level with the top, and supported the piece cut out from the hatchway in its original position. \"That will do rarely,\" Adolphe said, when it was finished and the hatchway experimentally placed in its position. \"Now, all you have to do is just to knock the ends of the beams off their ledges. The bit we have cut out will fall down, and you will be able easily enough to lift the hatchway from its place. It is no great weight now. \"It will do capitally,\" Harry agreed, \"and when it floats the tarpaulin will certainly be three inches above the water. Yes, I have no fear of that part of the adventure going wrong. You don\u0027t think that it will be noticed from the shore, Adolphe?\" \"Not it,\" Adolphe answered confidently. \"Why, from the shore it will look awash with the water. No one will ever dream that there could be a soul alive underneath it. I begin to think you will do it, monsieur. At first it seemed hopeless. Now I really do think there is a chance. I should feel pretty confident if it was you and two of us who had to do it; but the difficulty will be to get the young ladies under it, and then to get them to lie quiet there.\" \"That is the difficulty,\" Harry admitted. \"I am sure of the eldest. Her nerves are as good as mine; what I fear is about the younger.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what, monsieur,\" one of the other men said; \"if you take my advice you will have a piece of rope in readiness and tie it round her arms so as to prevent her struggling.\" \"That would be the best way,\" Harry agreed. \"Yes, if I see she won\u0027t be calm and do as I tell her, that is what I will do.\" \"Now, monsieur, I will bore a couple of auger-holes through the bulkhead here so that you can see what is going on in the hold. They have got the hatch off there. I suppose it wasn\u0027t padlocked, and they will no doubt go down to bore the holes the last thing. Like enough they have bored them already, and will only have to knock out the plugs. I will just go and see anyhow. If that is so you may set your mind at rest that none of them will come down here in the morning.\" So saying, taking the dark lantern he climbed up on deck, and descended the hold. \"That\u0027s it,\" he said when he returned; \"there are six holes bored with plugs in them, so they won\u0027t be coming down here. When we go up we will put the staple into its hole again, so that it will look all right. Now, monsieur, we will just have one nip of brandy apiece out of this bottle, and then we will be off. It\u0027s just gone midnight, and it were best we should leave you to sleep for a few hours. You will want your strength in the morning, unless, of course, you would rather we stopped with you for a bit.\" \"No, thank you, Adolphe, I don\u0027t think I shall sleep; I shall sit and think out every detail.\" \"Then good night, monsieur. May the good God bless you and aid you to-morrow, and I think he will! I do think you are the bravest man I ever met.\" \"I am not brave for myself, Adolphe, but for them.\" The three men shook hands with Harry, and one after another in husky voices gave him their good wishes. Then they ascended to the deck, put on the hatch, pressed the staple down through its holes in the deck, got into the boat, cast off the head-rope, and got out the oars. \"Mon Dieu, what courage!\" one of them exclaimed. \"His hand is as steady, and his voice as firm as if he were going fishing to-morrow.\" \"I think he will succeed;\" Adolphe said, \"anyhow, we will have our boat out below the bend of the river, and lend a hand to Pierre to get them out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3115/85758.html","bookId":929,"book":{"id":929,"title":"In the Reign of Terror","description":"简介： This time only a few words are needed, for the story speaks for itself.
