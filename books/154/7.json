{"id":4429,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 我 想 医 治 以 色 列 的 时 候 ， 以 法 莲 的 罪 孽 ， 和 撒 玛 利 亚 的 罪 恶 ， 就 显 露 出 来 。 他 们 行 事 虚 谎 ， 内 有 贼 人 入 室 偷 窃 ， 外 有 强 盗 成 群 骚 扰 。 [kjv] When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without. [bbe] When my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make Israel well, then the sin of Ephraim was made clear, and the evil-doing of Samaria; for their ways are false, and the thief comes into the house, while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets. 7:2 [hgb] 他 们 心 里 并 不 思 想 我 记 念 他 们 的 一 切 恶 ， 他 们 所 行 的 现 在 缠 绕 他 们 ， 都 在 我 面 前 。 [kjv] And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face. [bbe] And they do not say to themselves that I keep in mind all their sin; now their evil acts come round them on every side; they are before my face. 7:3 [hgb] 他 们 行 恶 使 君 王 欢 喜 ， 说 谎 使 首 领 喜 乐 。 [kjv] They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. [bbe] In their sin they make a king for themselves, and rulers in their deceit. 7:4 [hgb] 他 们 都 是 行 淫 的 ， 像 火 炉 被 烤 饼 的 烧 热 ， 从 抟 面 到 发 面 的 时 候 ， 暂 不 使 火 着 旺 。 [kjv] They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened. [bbe] They are all untrue; they are like a burning oven; the bread-maker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened. 7:5 [hgb] 在 我 们 王 宴 乐 的 日 子 ， 首 领 因 酒 的 烈 性 成 病 。 王 与 亵 慢 人 拉 手 。 [kjv] In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. [bbe] On the day of our king, the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine; his hand was stretched out with the men of pride. 7:6 [hgb] 首 领 埋 伏 的 时 候 ， 心 中 热 如 火 炉 ， 就 如 烤 饼 的 整 夜 睡 卧 ， 到 了 早 晨 火 气 炎 炎 。 [kjv] For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire. [bbe] For they have made their hearts ready like an oven, while they are waiting secretly; their wrath is sleeping all night; in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire. 7:7 [hgb] 众 民 也 热 如 火 炉 ， 烧 灭 他 们 的 官 长 。 他 们 的 君 王 都 仆 倒 而 死 。 他 们 中 间 无 一 人 求 告 我 。 [kjv] They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. [bbe] They are all heated like an oven, and they put an end to their judges; all their kings have been made low; not one among them makes prayer to me. 7:8 [hgb] 以 法 莲 与 列 邦 人 搀 杂 。 以 法 莲 是 没 有 翻 过 的 饼 。 [kjv] Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. [bbe] Ephraim is mixed with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned. 7:9 [hgb] 外 邦 人 吞 吃 他 劳 力 得 来 的 ， 他 却 不 知 道 ， 头 发 斑 白 ， 他 也 不 觉 得 。 [kjv] Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. [bbe] Men from other lands have made waste his strength, and he is not conscious of it; grey hairs have come on him here and there, and he has no knowledge of it. 7:10 [hgb] 以 色 列 的 骄 傲 当 面 见 证 自 己 ， 虽 遭 遇 这 一 切 ， 他 们 仍 不 归 向 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 也 不 寻 求 他 。 [kjv] And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this. [bbe] And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; but for all this, they have not gone back to the Lord their God, or made search for him. 7:11 [hgb] 以 法 莲 好 像 鸽 子 愚 蠢 无 知 。 他 们 求 告 埃 及 ， 投 奔 亚 述 。 [kjv] Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria. [bbe] And Ephraim is like a foolish dove, without wisdom; they send out their cry to Egypt, they go to Assyria. 7:12 [hgb] 他 们 去 的 时 候 ， 我 必 将 我 的 网 撒 在 他 们 身 上 ， 我 要 打 下 他 们 ， 如 同 空 中 的 鸟 。 我 必 按 他 们 会 众 所 听 见 的 惩 罚 他 们 。 [kjv] When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard. [bbe] When they go, my net will be stretched out over them; I will take them like the birds of heaven, I will give them punishment, I will take them away in the net for their sin. 7:13 [hgb] 他 们 因 离 弃 我 ， 必 定 有 祸 ， 因 违 背 我 ， 必 被 毁 灭 。 我 虽 要 救 赎 他 们 ， 他 们 却 向 我 说 谎 。 [kjv] Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. [bbe] May trouble be theirs! for they have gone far away from me; and destruction, for they have been sinning against me; I was ready to be their saviour, but they said false words against me. 7:14 [hgb] 他 们 并 不 诚 心 哀 求 我 ， 乃 在 床 上 呼 号 。 他 们 为 求 五 谷 新 酒 聚 集 ， 仍 然 悖 逆 我 。 [kjv] And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me. [bbe] And they have not made prayer to me in their hearts, but they make loud cries on their beds; they are cutting themselves for food and wine, they are turned against me. 7:15 [hgb] 我 虽 教 导 他 们 ， 坚 固 他 们 的 膀 臂 ， 他 们 竟 图 谋 抗 拒 我 。 [kjv] Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me. [bbe] Though I have given training and strength to their arms, they have evil designs against me. 7:16 [hgb] 他 们 归 向 ， 却 不 归 向 至 上 者 。 他 们 如 同 翻 背 的 弓 。 他 们 的 首 领 必 因 舌 头 的 狂 傲 倒 在 刀 下 ， 这 在 埃 及 地 必 作 人 的 讥 笑 。 [kjv] They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt. [bbe] They have gone to what is of no value; they are like a false bow; their captains will come to destruction by the sword, and their ruler by my wrath; for this, the land of Egypt will make sport of them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137/2035.html","bookId":154,"book":{"id":154,"title":"何西阿书 Hosea","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 作 犹 大 王 ， 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 ， 作 以 色 列 王 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 备 利 的 儿 子 何 西 阿 。 [kjv] The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Be...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
