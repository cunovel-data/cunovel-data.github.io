{"id":4430,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 你 用 口 吹 角 吧 。 敌 人 如 鹰 来 攻 打 耶 和 华 的 家 ， 因 为 这 民 违 背 我 的 约 ， 干 犯 我 的 律 法 。 \n [kjv] Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law. \n [bbe] Put the horn to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of the Lord; because they have gone against my agreement, they have not kept my law. \n 8:2 [hgb] 他 们 必 呼 叫 我 说 ， 我 的 神 阿 ， 我 们 以 色 列 认 识 你 了 。 \n [kjv] Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. \n [bbe] They will send up to me a cry for help: We, Israel, have knowledge of you, O God of Israel. \n 8:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 丢 弃 良 善 （ 或 作 福 分 ） ， 仇 敌 必 追 逼 他 。 \n [kjv] Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. \n [bbe] Israel has given up what is good; his haters will go after him. \n 8:4 [hgb] 他 们 立 君 王 ， 却 不 由 我 ， 他 们 立 首 领 ， 我 却 不 认 。 他 们 用 金 银 为 自 己 制 造 偶 像 ， 以 致 被 剪 除 。 \n [kjv] They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off. \n [bbe] They have put up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, but I had no knowledge of it; they have made images of silver and gold, so that they may be cut off. \n 8:5 [hgb] 撒 玛 利 亚 阿 ， 耶 和 华 已 经 丢 弃 你 的 牛 犊 。 我 的 怒 气 向 拜 牛 犊 的 人 发 作 。 他 们 到 几 时 方 能 无 罪 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency? \n [bbe] I will have nothing to do with your young ox, O Samaria; my wrath is burning against them; how long will it be before the children of Israel make themselves clean? \n 8:6 [hgb] 这 牛 犊 出 于 以 色 列 ， 是 匠 人 所 造 的 ， 并 不 是 神 。 撒 玛 利 亚 的 牛 犊 必 被 打 碎 。 \n [kjv] For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. \n [bbe] The workman made it, it is no god; the ox of Samaria will be broken into bits. \n 8:7 [hgb] 他 们 所 种 的 是 风 ， 所 收 的 是 暴 风 ， 所 种 的 不 成 禾 稼 ， 就 是 发 苗 也 不 结 实 。 即 便 结 实 ， 外 邦 人 必 吞 吃 。 \n [kjv] For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up. \n [bbe] For they have been planting the wind, and their fruit will be the storm; his grain has no stem, it will give no meal, and if it does, a strange nation will take it. \n 8:8 [hgb] 以 色 列 被 吞 吃 ， 现 今 在 列 国 中 ， 好 像 人 不 喜 悦 的 器 皿 。 \n [kjv] Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure. \n [bbe] Israel has come to destruction; now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure. \n 8:9 [hgb] 他 们 投 奔 亚 述 ， 如 同 独 行 的 野 驴 。 以 法 莲 贿 买 朋 党 。 \n [kjv] For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. \n [bbe] For they have gone up to Assyria like an ass going by himself; Ephraim has given money to get lovers. \n 8:10 [hgb] 他 们 虽 在 列 邦 中 贿 买 人 ， 现 在 我 却 要 聚 集 惩 罚 他 们 。 他 们 因 君 王 和 首 领 所 加 的 重 担 ， 日 渐 衰 微 。 \n [kjv] Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. \n [bbe] But though they give money to the nations for help, still I will send them in all directions; and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers. \n 8:11 [hgb] 以 法 莲 增 添 祭 坛 取 罪 ， 因 此 ， 祭 坛 使 他 犯 罪 。 \n [kjv] Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. \n [bbe] Because Ephraim has been increasing altars for sin, altars have become a cause of sin to him. \n 8:12 [hgb] 我 为 他 写 了 律 法 万 条 ， 他 却 以 为 与 他 毫 无 关 涉 。 \n [kjv] I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing. \n [bbe] Though I put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules, they are to him as a strange thing. \n 8:13 [hgb] 至 于 献 给 我 的 祭 物 ， 他 们 自 食 其 肉 ， 耶 和 华 却 不 悦 纳 他 们 。 现 在 必 记 念 他 们 的 罪 孽 ， 追 讨 他 们 的 罪 恶 ， 他 们 必 归 回 埃 及 。 \n [kjv] They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. \n [bbe] He gives the offerings of his lovers, and takes the flesh for food; but the Lord has no pleasure in them; now he will keep in mind their evil-doing and give them the punishment of their sins; they will go back to Egypt. \n 8:14 [hgb] 以 色 列 忘 记 造 他 的 主 ， 建 造 宫 殿 。 犹 大 多 造 坚 固 城 ， 我 却 要 降 火 焚 烧 他 的 城 邑 ， 烧 灭 其 中 的 宫 殿 。 \n [kjv] For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof. \n [bbe] For Israel has no memory of his Maker, and has put up the houses of kings; and Judah has made great the number of his walled towns. But I will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137/2036.html","bookId":154,"book":{"id":154,"title":"何西阿书 Hosea","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 作 犹 大 王 ， 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 ， 作 以 色 列 王 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 备 利 的 儿 子 何 西 阿 。 [kjv] The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Be...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
