They are quite without value; in Gilgal they make offerings of oxen; truly their altars are like masses of stones in the hollows of a ploughed field. \n 12:12 [hgb] 从 前 雅 各 逃 到 亚 兰 地 ， 以 色 列 为 得 妻 服 事 人 ， 为 得 妻 与 人 放 羊 。 \n [kjv] And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. \n [bbe] And Jacob went in flight into the field of Aram, and Israel became a servant for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. \n 12:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 借 先 知 领 以 色 列 从 埃 及 上 来 ， 以 色 列 也 借 先 知 而 得 保 存 。 \n [kjv] And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved. \n [bbe] And by a prophet the Lord made Israel come up out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was kept safe. \n 12:14 [hgb] 以 法 莲 大 大 惹 动 主 怒 ， 所 以 他 流 血 的 罪 ， 必 归 在 他 身 上 ， 主 必 将 那 因 以 法 莲 所 受 的 羞 辱 归 还 他 。 \n [kjv] Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD return unto him. \n [bbe] I have been bitterly moved to wrath by Ephraim; so that his blood will be on him, and the Lord will make his shame come back on him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137/2040.html","bookId":154,"book":{"id":154,"title":"何西阿书 Hosea","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 当 乌 西 雅 ， 约 坦 ， 亚 哈 斯 ， 希 西 家 作 犹 大 王 ， 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 ， 作 以 色 列 王 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 备 利 的 儿 子 何 西 阿 。 [kjv] The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Be...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/137","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
